frame for this all right so today we are
gonna be putting this bad boy on our
face and talking about him this is the
brand new urban decay naked smoky
palette urban case felt smoky wrong not
sure why they felt the need to do that
so I'm just gonna give you guys my
thoughts on this palette I did film that
I look I'm wearing right now pre warning
 got a little crazy who's one of
those days where like everything I was
doing was just not happening how I
wanted it to but I kept it in because
happens to everyone and it's how you can
fix it that matters
how does enhance oh I ordered my palette
off of Sephora this is the box that it
came in let's start off by talking about
this frickin packaging I think this is
my all-time favorite packaging out of
any eyeshadow palette I own I literally
just want to frame this thing the
overall packaging of this feels super
high-quality super luxurious this is my
favorite part
get ready for this that not the most
satisfying sound you ever heard the
Naked 2 palette was sturdy but not as
sturdy as this one at all Tamiya this is
worth the $54 alone this packaging is so
beautiful there's a huge mirror on the
inside so let's talk about the shades so
this palette retails for $54 from
Sephora and you get 12 shades so you can
do the math there 9 of the shades are
brand new exclusive to this palette and
then three are repeats from other
palettes when I want to wear cooler
tones I've been mixing password with
combust which are these two shades right
here that gives kind of a nice like
light gray color for the crease and I'll
just put on mascara and we're like good
to go the only downside I found with
this palette so far is that there needs
to be a light silver shimmery color that
you can put on the inner corner on your
lid because you guys will see in the
demo but I kind of got stuck it wasn't
really a good light shade to add to the
look I'm just gonna go down the line and
swatch some of these for you guys so
starting from this finger we have hi
what is this dirty sweet and radar next
we have armor slanted and dagger I'm
wearing armor and dagger on my eyes
right now kind of typical for naked
shadows but armor applies a lot better
with just your fingers rather than a
if I'm not to be true for almost every
like shimmery color in the naked
palettes then we have a nice matte black
shade black market which is really soft
black market smolder and password
password is a nice like topi kind of
gray color actually really like the
shade of password last three that we
have here is whiskey combust and 13 you
totally do a nice neutral matte Iowa
theist 3 as far as shadow quality all of
these feel pretty typical for Urban
Decay eyeshadows they do feel a little
bit more soft than the other ones
something I've also noticed over the
years with urban decay palettes is that
I'm allergic to something in these
eyeshadows after like a minute of having
them on I usually get kind of like red
itchy eyes there's something different
in these shadows because with this
palette it doesn't happen to me so
that's awesome I've put on my face
makeup first today and you'll see in the
demo but I didn't experience any fallout
on my cheeks or anything I definitely
didn't need this palette I do have a lot
of similar shades and other palettes but
if you are a beginner or you're looking
just for a palette that has a good array
of shades for a smoky eye and like a
neutral kind of matte eye I feel like
this is worth it alone the packaging to
me is honestly worth it like this
packaging makes me very happy
so is there just some quick thoughts on
this palette if you want to see how I
got this look you're in the right place
just keep watching so I'm just gonna
start off by priming the eyes I'm use
the Maybelline Color tattoo you this
isn't a shade audacious asphalt feel
like they just tried to make asphalt
into like a really graceful name oh this
is pretty dry let's just warm it up a
little see how that goes felt pretty dry
I'm just gonna prime my lids with this
stuff Maybelline Color tattoos are
awesome for priming your eyeshadow
they're like eight or nine bucks at the
drugstore just doesn't have to be
perfect so just gonna be putting
eyeshadow on top just gonna take the
little brush that it comes with out of
here I don't typically like Urban Decay
brushes I feel like they're a little bit
too firm all the shades in here are
super cool tone so the only thing is
kind of missing is like a warm color for
the crease I'm just gonna mix combust
and a password just a tiny bit of
password on the end of my it cosmetics
brush it's my favorite brush for the
crease and we're just gonna blend that
directly in the crease if you like
people and out a little more easily than
the other three palettes there
okay God when is every decay gonna stop
making naked pellets
yeah I think I'm definitely gonna want
to add in some warm shade in the crease
afterward it's why are you so bright
thank you I'm going to take my Sedona
lace Evo nine and going with black
market we're going to put this on the
nono we might put this like everywhere
I'm gonna focus it mostly on the outer
half and blend it inwards
I'm gonna drag it into the inner corner
a little bit we're actually putting this
all over the lid apparently then we're
gonna drop in a lighter shadow on the
lid so far not any horrible fallout
actually at all with this black you want
to make sure you're not bringing it too
far into the crease we're gonna go and
blend it out with a warm brown shade
afterwards next I'm gonna take armor I'm
gonna take this brush by Urban Decay
which I not really use that it's like a
flat shadow brush armor looks like it's
gonna have some fallout and there's some
glitter in here so I'm just gonna spray
that with my L'Oreal setting spray this
has a really nice big mirror on here by
the way I'm just gonna put this all over
the lid on top of that black keeping the
outer third and inner corner of matte I
feel like they're kind of missing a
light shadow they have this one in here
but this is like a champagne color and
then this one's mad like I don't know
what to put on my lid now in the
meantime we're gonna take peanut butter
from the Too Faced semi-sweet pellet and
this is just a nice warm shade for the
crease and i'm just gonna super super
lightly blend this into the crease i
don't want this to get too muddy with
that black so i'm using a super light
hand right now I'm also gonna blend
peanut butter on the bottom lash line
and blending peanut butter pretty far
down and we're just gonna have to keep
armor on the lid because I don't know
what else to put on here I'm just gonna
take my finger and go over that see if
we can get a little more okay that looks
way better applied with your finger you
can see that just pop now then I'm going
to take black market again and just
build up the outer third a little bit
more I want to add a black liner to the
waterline I'm gonna go in with NYX tres
Jolie
who knows and put this on the waterline
I haven't used this before but it's nice
it has a little twist up thing so you
have to sharpen it definitely have to do
a couple layers of this stuff on the
waterline I'm gonna take dagger which is
this matte dark grey shade we're gonna
blend this on the bottom lashline for
eyeliner I'm going to use this Milani
eye tech perfection we'll see I might
have to go over it with my Physicians
Formula this handle still confuses me
like what is going on alright so I just
basically had a major eyeliner disaster
and I thought about just taking
everything off and starting over but
we're gonna try and fix it and maybe
this can help you if you also mess up
sometimes so I'm just taking some
concealer and dabbing this over the
inner corner basically that Milani eye
liner and I like never get along I don't
know why I tried to do that I already
cleaned up the outer edges a little bit
with concealer but the inner corner just
got got a little wild so I just wiped
off some of the eyeliner with a makeup
wipe and then put some concealer and
we're gonna go in with a lighter shade
on the inner corner to like open up the
eyes again there really isn't a good one
in the naked smoky so I'm gonna go in
with the Naked 2 palette if I can find
it I'm gonna take a verb that is
probably my favorite shade urban decay
has ever made to put on tiny see brush
and then spray it down and then we're
just gonna put this on the inner corner
I'm going with combust again make sure
everything is blended I think I
literally redid this wing about five
times just not in the cards today so I
put one coat mascara on my top lashes
before we apply falsies in order to
compensate for the shitty eyeliner today
I'm gonna be using one of my favorite
lashes these are the kiss me 0-3 lashes
you can get them off eBay I'll link them
down below now we're going to be trying
out the newest Kito lash glue look at
how freakin pretty this is rose gold
packaging this is the companion' long
lasting bond it has a nice brush
applicator but we're just gonna brush it
on it looks pretty thin
Perkin love these lashes I need to stop
with a freaking eyeliner and now it
looks like a q-tip that's really as good
as it's gonna get today we're gonna put
on some bottom mascara this is wet and
wild Magelang and then we'll be done
with the eyeballs I might look right now
the mascara will get all over my
concealer all right so here's the final
look on the lips I use the la / smitten
lip tint moose in inflamed yeah overall
happy with how the shadow is blended out
I had pretty much no fall out while I
was applying those if you guys liked
