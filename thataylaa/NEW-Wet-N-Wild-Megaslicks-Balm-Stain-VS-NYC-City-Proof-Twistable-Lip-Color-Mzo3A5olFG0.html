comparison lip products video for you
guys when to ride a to get cold medicine
because I'm still freaking sick and came
out with a a ton of makeup again every
time they had a ton of new products on
the end displays and I can't say no to
those so so both of these products the
NYC city proof twistable intense lip
color crayon and the mega slick sweat
mild bomb stain these are both brand-new
products the wet wild has a tiny bit
more product in it it has point 1 0
ances and this has point 0 7 ounces they
both retail for $2.99 at my drugstore
but the wet and wild one came with one
of those peel off coupons $4 off so I
got this one for $1.99 in the NYC for
$2.99
I really don't understand what this
whole like crayon lip product fad is to
me I just want to like color with these
and not put them on my lips so at my
drugstore I'm looking at the picture I
took of the display the NYX lip product
came in about 11 or 12 different shades
and the wet and wild one it looks like
came in originally six shades but they
only had three at my drugstore I tried
to choose colors that were similar but
you'll see that one of them is a tiny
bit lighter than the other one
NYC one I chosen 0-5 to Roosevelt Island
red and the wet and wild is in one to
five ready or not for the price I think
both of them are actually very good
moisturizing lip products but I do like
one of them better than the other so
stay tuned to see which one that is
we're getting pretty personal right now
I'll turn off the heater alright so I'm
going to be starting with the NYC
intense lip color one first because the
wet wild one claims to be a bomb stain
so that'll be hopefully harder to get
off then the lip color so we're gonna
start with this one I tried to pick
colors that were really
similar and I don't know just you can
you know fully compare okay so it looks
like this it has this clear plastic top
that you obviously take off the bottom
twist up let's see how high it goes
let's get I'm going to break it um okay
so it looks like oh my god I really hope
it doesn't break so that is as high as
the product goes smells like exactly
like a cherry skittle and I kind of want
to eat it so I'm just going to apply
this like I normally would
feels really soft going on different
than I expected it for some reason and
feels exactly like a chapstick which is
interesting
it's not very pigmented for red lipstick
it looks a lot darker in the tube to me
I pictured this like a deep red it's
definitely like an orange e cherry kind
of red and I don't know if you guys can
see but it is kind of gathering on my
chopped the chapped part of my lips but
it feels pretty nice it definitely feels
moisturizing doesn't really feel like
you're wearing anything besides like a
normal trap stick the smell is making me
hungry I don't know how I feel but smell
the issue with this is that I feel like
it's so moisturizing that for red
lipstick I feel like it's going to like
slide off my face not really I don't
know kind of on the fence about it let's
try the other one and we'll see how they
kind of compare okay so this is in the
shade 125 ready or not does this twist
up okay so this also twists up from the
bottom it's kind of hard to twist I'm
just going to apply it in the same way
that I did the other one
it feels pretty much identical so far
going on super moisturizing
I like the color of this one much better
as much more intense looks like a pretty
kind of ruby red it does have a little
bit of a gloss finish to it right now
like I said it feels very similar to the
NYC one feels very very moisturizing
like literally just feels like you have
chapstick on your lips since this is a
balm stain I'm going to let it sit for a
few minutes and I will come back to see
if this kind of set in the lips
sometimes they magnify a little bit the
balm stains so we'll see what happens do
I have it on my tooth alright so it's
been about five minutes and it seems to
still have a glossy finish it hasn't
really set in the lips I'm curious to
see how long this will stay on so I
wanted to show you guys an update after
it's been about an hour and a half the
gloss is not really there but I actually
prefer that it feels like it's like sunk
into my lips better now but it still
looks really vibrant and nice the color
pigmentation is definitely still there
so let's do a cup so I have my coca-cola
cup of water from Dollar Tree which I'm
obsessed with if you watch any of my
videos you know that I literally want to
buy the entire stock of these glasses
anyways let's do a cup test whoa so
literally there's you can't even really
see anything besides my lip mark on the
cup dragon yep no lip no lip mark that's
always a plus I'm actually very
impressed I wasn't really expecting that
who knew as far as the pigmentation goes
I would definitely say that the wet wild
bomb stain is more pigmented I like the
texture both of them so I guess I would
say I would choose the wet and wild bomb
stain over the NYC lip color because you
have that longer-lasting factor as a
bomb stain and it doesn't feel drying at
all like most bomb stains do so that's
always a plus this is the winner all I
do is we we win no matter what everybody
hands go up and they say I do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
