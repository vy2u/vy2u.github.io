I'm confused
alright so today it is day four of
fifteen days of foundation this is where
I try out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days days one through three
are linked down below in the season five
playlist so you can go back and watch
those if you missed any link to t-shirts
that down below 100% of the proceeds go
to project B share we're shooting to
raise $20,000 let's do this so today
we're talking about a drugstore cushion
foundation by wet-and-wild this is their
mega cushion foundation not a very
clever name so I got this off of Ulta
retails for $8.99 and you get 0.5 two
ounces of product in here I do have a
handful of other cushion foundation
reviews on my channel so you can just
search cushion foundation the Taylor on
YouTube and any will come up but just to
give you a comparison with size here and
the Maybelline Dream cushion foundation
you get 0.51 ounces of product choose
ones are in grams not helpful let's do
some converting here they're about 15
grams to 0.5 2 ounces so you do get the
standard kind of amount in this cushion
foundation that you do compared to
others so cushion foundations are a
Korean product in the last few years a
lot of American brands have been coming
out with them the Maybelline Dream
cushion we have the L'Oreal Lumi Mel
says is infused with coconut derivative
this luminous lightweight and buildable
formula helps boost hydration and
contains SPF 15 for added skin
protection so it doesn't actually say
what kind of coverage is supposed to be
it just as it's buildable just notes on
the back it also says it's vegan so this
is vegan and cruelty free so in both of
these cushion foundations it only comes
in 8 shades the big difference here is
that the wet-and-wild cushion foundation
has about 8 shades of light to medium
never brands have a shade range like
this where it starts at a number like
106 and it kind of jumps every few
shades with different numbering that
makes me think that they're gonna be
launching more shades hopefully so I'm
gonna search swatches right here so you
can see with the lightest shade of the
Wet n Wild mega cushion foundation looks
like compared to the dream cushion some
other cushion foundations and just a
couple others I'll throw in there got to
have that derma Col so these first three
right here are cushion foundations which
are a little bit tricky to swatch but
hopefully they're showing up for you
guys so right here is the wet-and-wild
cushion foundation and the lightest
shade 106 a next over is Misha magic M
in the lightest shade 21 and then the
Maybelline Dream cushion in the lightest
shade 10 so the wet wild one is the
out of these three cushions October's
cover effects power play and p20 this is
either coming or it's already up filming
swatches for another day right now
here's the CYO life proof in 101 NARS
radiant foundation in Mont Blanc
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 and derma called 2:08 so if you're
enjoying 15 days foundation while you're
watching don't forget to give this a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the BAE Rito family and subscribe
I'm uploading every single day the 15 to
the 29th 6 p.m. Pacific time okay so
it's 10:20 6 in the morning right now it
feels like it should be like 3 o'clock
I've already worked out and done 50,000
things so excited to try this I just
painted my nails so hopefully I can get
this box open here's what the packaging
looks like I'm not a huge fan of it I
feel like it almost looks like kids
makeup or something those cushion
foundations you get this compact that
should snap shut really well so the air
doesn't get in there okay well you just
have to really push that one then it
opens up just pop this thing open and
peel off the seal right there so I have
a couple cushion foundations that I
absolutely love the me shape magic mm
cushion foundation is probably my
favorite I'll link that one down below
you can get it for like 13 bucks on
YesStyle when it goes on sale so it is
pretty affordable if you get it on sale
but with most cushion foundations I do
typically like to use the applicator
that they come with because you just
kind of do this like press and roll
motion with cushion foundations and it
tends to give the best coverage doesn't
look as good with a brush doesn't look
as good with a sponge typically but just
for the sake of the review I'm gonna try
half my face with a brush so it says
this has coconut derivative mmm kind of
just smells like sunscreen alright here
we go so I'm just gonna press into here
looks like a decent amount of product
came out okay it looks a lot lighter
than it does in the cushion look at how
dark the cushion looks compared to the
actual product it's looking even lighter
on camera but in real life it looks
pretty dark but the shade looks pretty
nice so I'm going to do some press in
and roll in and it's going very far that
amount of product I do feel like I'm
having to work this in a little bit more
than usual with cushion foundations
because when you first put this on you
get kind of those lines with this
applicator so it's just taking a few
seconds longer than usual cushion
foundations are usually really really
quick
this isn't like long or anything it just
is taking a few more seconds
I'm gonna go down the neck to see if I
can cover my scarring down here it
definitely goes pretty far like I'm
gonna have to kind of drag this over
whew that looks good on the center of my
forehead it looks very smooth
okay I'm gonna kind of bring this over
because I do have too much product that
shade actually matches me very well
like the undertone and everything looks
really nice looking at my neck that's a
very very close shade match for me if
that doesn't oxidize
it looks very luminous but not too oily
or anything it's sitting on my skin
really nice it looks pretty good I am
getting again that crease mark right
here so I don't know what's going on
there maybe that's just my skin right
now I happened with yesterday's
foundation a little bit coverage with
this applicator I would say is low
medium coverage I still see a lot of my
skin coming through I can see scarring
freckles everything basically just
canceled out the redness which I've
actually been looking for something like
this just to go run errands with or to
whatever
I know cushion foundations aren't meant
to be used with a brush just for the
sake of trying it why not so I'm just
dipping my brush directly in here
it actually smells pretty scented when
it's on your face so the brush side was
a bit quicker I would say about 30
seconds quicker but I definitely prefer
the way that the cushion side looks it
looks like light coverage with the brush
I think I got a tiny bit better coverage
on this side but as far as the finish
and everything it looks really pretty
just looks like skin I'm gonna go in and
see if I can build this out but it is
supposed to be buildable so I think I
just got too much but we'll just burn it
to the other side
I just want to see how much coverage I
can get ooh that looks good
read this over here I don't want to
bring it right around my nose because I
do get creasing there so I'm just
keeping this right on the areas where I
want that extra coverage
I'm almost liking the way it applies
better just patting it rather than doing
the roll ooh that looks pretty ok now
we're at about hi medium coverage it's
covering a lot more of my scarring and
everything oh right now this is looking
freaking stunning hell yeah
looking real up-close the only thing I
notice is again these two marks which
might just be my skin right now it's
again that happened yesterday but look
at my forehead it looks so smooth it's
not settling into my lines up here it
just looks very healthy and glowy since
it is so glowy my pores are emphasized a
little bit around my nose so I probably
used my Revlon pore filling primer next
time I use this just in this area right
here to kind of fill that in a little
bit before I put on the foundation those
two layers on - it doesn't feel heavy or
anything feels just like I have a tinted
moisturizer on or something is
definitely tacky sticky though so I
would need to set this part of my face
that's usually what I do with the
products like this I don't like setting
my forehead because on my dry skin it
just does not look good and lasts pretty
well throughout the day without setting
it so far I'm really excited about this
one the shade everything the finish is
just exactly what I've been going for
lately so right now it's 1044 I'm gonna
do the rest of my makeup and I'll be
right back
all right the rest of my makeups on it's
now pretty much 11:40 I was having major
technical difficulties with this eyelash
but I think it's mostly on now we're
gonna call the check-in time eleven
o'clock since that's when I finished up
with my face makeup so I did end up
setting we're gonna the car
I set just like I said this part of my
face just with the laura geller balance
to brighten I think it looks beautiful
I am especially loving the way my
forehead looks I want to emphasize that
this is very glowy if you have dry skin
you'll probably love this if you have
oily skin you'll probably definitely
want to set this one that's how it is
with most cushion foundations if you
have oily skin you want them to last so
probably have to set it and I touch my
forehead it is still sticky so this
doesn't feel like one that sets down
have that bothers do you either set your
whole face of powder or don't get this
one that doesn't personally bother me
all right we're gonna do a flashes
button
come on so there is a little bit of
flashback probably because of the SPF in
there I almost wish they didn't put the
SPF in there because SPF 15 is such a
low amount that you could probably still
have to use her moisturizer underneath
with SPF in it anyways so if that's the
case then I would just rather have the
foundation not have SPF it's a little
almost as you can see out here I think
the shade is almost a perfect match
love the shade I love the amount of do
meanness and luminosity but that's just
me I'm loving the way it looks right now
no other complaints I'll see how it
wears throughout the day but so far so
good so on the rest my face for bronzer
I tried out the new Anastacio Beverly
Hills
tawny bronzer I ordered this and it
looked a lot lighter on line and in the
swatches I saw this one I think imma be
returning this is the second time I've
used this and I feel like it's just a
little bit too dark and warm for my skin
tone so I think I'm gonna be returning
this but the highlight I use this is the
Anastacio amrezy highlight and I mean
look at this thing this is such a
beautiful highlight I've kind of posted
a mini review on snapchat a couple weeks
ago views us about five times now I want
to say and every time I've used it it
kind of grows on me I've seen deeper
skin tones wearing this and I also feel
like this definitely works for fair skin
so that's awesome blush I use the
covergirl trublend blush in medium rose
eyeshadows I tried the BH Cosmetics glam
reflection this is the first time I used
the gold palette but they also had one
that had like a rose gold cover that I
gave to my cousin but so far Michael
out of both of these pallets our that
the mats are okay that they're not my
favorite mats ever but they are soft
they totally work and you can get a nice
blended look what I recommend that you
buy it probably not not my favorite
palette the BH Cosmetics has made and
the shimmer shades are very scratchy
shimmer shades are not good in these
ones I had an eyeliner struggle today
because I tried out this new eyeliner by
Smashbox this has always on liquid
eyeliner this one was fine not my
favorite eyeliner I think it worked but
I probably wouldn't reach for this one
again over some of my other eyeliners
and then this mascara I did not like it
all this is the super fan fanned out
mascara by Smashbox you want a super
natural mascara to the point where you
can't really tell you have my scare on
at all then go for this but if you want
a mascara that's really gonna do
something it did a whole lot of nothing
then I went in with these I'll or accent
lashes number zero zero five and I love
these normally I feel like my eyes burn
and I can't really keep lashes on an
entire day you've seen any of my war
chest videos I usually peel them off
after like an hour but these ones I mean
we'll see but I think I'm gonna be able
to keep these on all day because they're
not all the way to my inner corner they
don't feel too annoying like I feel like
I can keep these on my eyes now my
lipstick I did a weird combo I have
Milani matte naked this is one of my
favorite lipsticks ever the shade
beautiful but I wanted to lighten it up
a little bit so I went in with this gosh
lipstick which I don't think I've used
ever or in a really long time I got this
in London this isn't a shade baby lips
and it's like this light pink color but
it was one of those lipstick formulas
that just made my lips look so dry so
then I went in with this again on top of
it the Maybelline vivid hot lacquer and
the shade tease and I just love the way
that this lightens up any of your lips I
wear this in yesterday's video so that's
that folks so check-in time is 11
o'clock I'll see you guys in a few hours
in natural lighting
it says 542 so it's been on for almost 7
hours at this point I usually do
checking out like the five hour point
but I got totally sidetracked so here we
are there's still a little bit of light
out oh this is definitely just my skin
right now I just have like a major dry
patch right here totally peely from the
accutane I feel like my forehead doesn't
look bad but it could definitely look a
little bit better
it's just settling into my line
right here and then I feel like it's
kind of starting to separate right on
the center it doesn't look bad and I
feel like if I just use the cushion to
kind of smooth it out it would probably
look pretty good I'm not going to touch
it up just for the sake of the review
but this is what the rest of my face
looks like I'm getting really really
faint creasing on my upper lip not as
bad as usual it looks pretty good I
wouldn't say my face looks like
phenomenal after seven hours but I also
don't think it looks bad buy any mints
right now there's just a couple small
things so I'm gonna go get some sushi
with a friend come back here and I'll do
the final check in later time okay so
it's now 921 so it's been on for over
ten hours at this point and this is some
major peeling around my mouth now this
is like the first intense accutane
dryness peeling I've ever had I mean
we'll need to put some off before on
that take out this makeup but here's
what the rest of my makeup is looking
like I do feel like my blush and bronzer
has faded a little bit throughout the
day everything besides the obvious area
right here
I think looks pretty similar to the last
check-in the only thing I don't like is
that separation right on the center of
my forehead maybe I need a different
primer right there to really lock it in
on the center the rest of my point it
actually looks better now than I did at
last check and I feel like it actually
looks a little bit dewier it doesn't
feel too sticky yeah it's not coming off
and it doesn't feel too sticky it feels
a lot less sticky than earlier overall
so far I really like this one for dry
skin I feel like this is definitely a
product that I can kind of play around
with different primers and setting
sprays and find the best way to wear
this one because I do love the shade I
don't think it's oxidized throughout the
day I liked how it looked beautiful when
it first went on and there is a little
bit of work that could be done on the
forehead to make it look better overall
I'm into this one I would definitely
wear this again I would even wear it
again this is I mean it doesn't look bad
or anything at all I just think I could
make it a little bit better so whenever
I try them out with different products
I'll update you guys in the wrap-up
video which is going up on April 9th
that's also when I announce the winning
shelter the winning
city and all the ranking and everything
