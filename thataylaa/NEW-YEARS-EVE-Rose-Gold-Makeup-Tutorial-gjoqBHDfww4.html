have a New Year's Eve rose-gold II kind
of look it is almost 2016 don't know how
that happened but I feel like 2015 was
actually a really good year I hope you
guys had a good year if not it's almost
a new year new start new you in this
video I also did a quick taste test of
the love with Food Box I talked about
this before on my channel I love love
with food basically an organic natural
food subscription box they have three
different kinds of boxes and they
started at $8 each it's just a good way
to try out new kinds of snacks that you
might not necessarily choose to buy on
your own if you use the link in the
description box you can get 40% off your
first box which is a really good deal
also the first video that I'm filming in
real time the videos you guys have been
seeing have been pre-recorded a couple
weeks because of the holidays so I just
want to say a giant thank you for the
overwhelming amount of positivity and
just super nice comments that I got on
the hundred thousand subscriber video my
getting emotional just thinking about it
I was not expecting that kind of
response at all that video had over a
thousand comments on it I think that's
the most I've ever gotten on any video
before just reminded me why I do this
and I just want to say thank you for all
of you who left comments if you guys
want to see how I got this look and you
want to eat bean chips with me for
breakfast you're in the right place just
keep watching all right it is 11:15 a.m.
and we are going to eat some food this
is actually my breakfast so this is
gonna be fun so I have my love with food
box here I'm just gonna dig in and taste
a new bean chips I'm let's start out
with these bonitos nacho cheese chips
because for some reason this sounds like
a really good breakfast right now it
tastes exactly like a healthy bag of
Doritos alright so I already have my
base on because I'm doing a review on
the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
right now so I already have my base done
that that video will be up after this
video probably so if you want to see my
thoughts on this make sure you're
subscribed you click the button right
and you get notified when I put up new
videos that's great prime my eyes with
max soft ochre Paint Pot just makes it
stay on forever and if you're gonna be
out dancing on New Year's Eve prime
those eyes ladies so I really want to do
like a rose gold I haven't done one in a
while so for this look I'm using pretty
affordable products a couple of these
you can get at the drugstore the
revealed 2 palette is one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes of life I think it's
around $19 on Coastal Scents but they do
usually do sales I'll link it down below
but this is a frickin bomb affordable
eyeshadow palette I have a whole review
on this and I have a couple there at
tutorials using it so we're gonna start
out by going in with this light pink the
dusty rose kinda color here and I'm just
going to be blending this into the
crease blend chip bringing this out a
little bit farther than I usually do
just because we're gonna be doing a
pretty intense wing I think so I just
want to make my eyes look longer what
are you guys doing on New Year's Eve let
me know down below right now I'm
planning on having a good Netflix and
pizza night it's gonna get wild I'm
gonna take this fluffy blending brush by
Coastal Scents which I haven't used yet
this is their BR 250 I want to see if
this is like an affordable version of
the Mac 2 - why am i slicing out on the
number you know I'm talking about gonna
let this slightly deeper dusty rose kind
of mauve color and blend this on top of
what we just did but a little bit
farther down into the crease ooh this is
super soft I'm bringing this all the way
in cool thing about these brushes the
shape is that if you turn it sideways
you can blend upwards into the crease
with the same brush so once you put on
your product and you have it where you
want it to be you can blend it by just
turn in the brush these shadows are
super easy to blend out these are a
hundred percent vegies sweet corn crunch
dried snacks I've never had a crunchy
corn dried corn oh yeah popcorn wait
what how is this different than popcorn
oh I think this is just H baked kernels
Oh bag is frickin sealed
no one's getting in this Court little
baked kernels hmm very light and airy
you you get a little container and pv2
powdered peanut butter Rach really likes
this stuff I think you just mix this
with water and it's like a healthier
alternative to peanut butter is slow
restore them press to remove 85% of the
fat and oil now that we have this crease
colors down I'm going to go in with this
dark reddish brown color this is my
favorite shade in the palette you can
use this with so many different looks
I'm gonna go with that same brush again
why not
we're gonna focus this mostly on the
outer portion of my eye I'm putting this
directly in the crease again and then
we're gonna create a little v-shape here
this is not bringing it too far up into
the crease so it still looks blended on
the top we're gonna go in with an empty
blending brush afterwards and just blend
out those edges I'm gonna go back with
my said only CV 13
so my Holy Grail brushes let me know if
you guys want to see a favorite brush
video I've never done one of those let
me know if that's something you want to
see I'm gonna take the Sedona lace 904
brush and going with the black shade in
the palette we're just gonna deep enough
this outer portion a little bit so I'm
literally just focusing this on the
outer corner of my eye I'm gonna go back
in with this trusty what does this
Coastal Scents brush blend
I'm just really lightly blending this we
don't want it to look too muddy I am
really excited to try these these are
apple cinnamon fruit leather fruit
leather brings me back to like the
kindergarten days whoa this is like
legit they look a little hard oh they're
hearts that's so cute look at this this
is some sticky fruit leather okay here
we go
hook spin it's not too sweet and it's
not too cinnamon here's a couple packets
of nume tea in here chocolate Earl Grey
that sounds good and tumeric Amber's
amber Sun okay
now on to the fun part of the ice we're
gonna go in with the rose gold sheet so
I'm going to take the pure cosmetics I
polish in
Silke these are kind of interesting
products it says it's a base and a top
coat
these are super pigmented and it's kind
of like an interesting cushion situation
right here so I'm just going to take a
little bit on my finger and just apply
this to look at how pigmented that is
just apply this to the lid I don't want
to go too far into that black shade so
I'm just lightly blending this out
honestly you could like stop right here
with this color look at that the nice
thing about these is that they have a
sparkle to them but you're not gonna get
any fallout at all because it's a liquid
I'm gonna go back in with the reveal to
pellet and take this pink shimmery shade
right here I'm going to wet my brush a
shape is a little bit powdery so I'm
going to wet my brush so we can get all
the product packed on there I'm going to
take this Real Techniques brush spray it
with some setting spray you can use any
setting spray mac fix+
fix what mac fix+ water whatever you
want go in with this shape alright I'm
switching to the finger this is just
working better I'm gonna go back in with
the warm brown shade that we used
earlier and blend a little bit of this
into the crease just to define it a
little bit more I'm feeling like we need
a little bit more sparkle and kind of
pop so I'm gonna go in with this makeup
geek shadow this is in the spotlight
super pretty shimmery of pinkish but
then take my finger and put this right
on the center of the eye oh yeah there
we go
we have a luna mini chocolate peppermint
stick in here I'm gonna keep this and
throw this in my purse then we have bite
size midnight brownie go PACs brownies
for breakfast is always a good idea
these are like little mini cookies are
these gluten free
yep I can tell by the texture hmm is
there after really good if you've ever
had to Trader Joe's chocolate little
animal cookies that's kinda what they
taste like bottom lashline I'm gonna go
in with some black eyeliner this is the
J cat Beauty waterproof slide-on pencil
I've never tried this before so we'll
see
on the waterline all tie carries up now
I don't know if it's only online I think
it might be I love their baked
eyeshadows I did a whole Instagram post
on it and not the best waterline
eyeliner I've tried and we don't know
the different eyeliner for the waterline
this is la girl glide on gel liner this
is my favorite one for the waterline
super black and just lies on so easily
like a look at that my camera just
overheated but we're back all I did was
winged eyeliner same as I always do it
this is a physician's formula eye
booster in ultra black if I could marry
an eye liner this would be it now we're
gonna blend out the bottom lash line so
I'm going in with that black shadow in
the palette and just blending out that
eyeliner with this want the lower lash
line to be really smoky and connected to
this wing basically I'm only gonna focus
the black eyeshadow in the outer third
and then we're gonna blend the rest with
a different color I just ordered the
Canon 70d which I am super excited about
so we're not gonna have this overheating
issue anymore at the quality should be a
lot better and it has auto focus time to
upgrade
I sold my Canon t5i that one just didn't
work for me so hoping this one is better
I'm gonna go with the warm brown shade
blend underneath that and then
underneath that shade we're gonna blend
that dusty rose color that we started
with this is just gonna help make it
look super blended and kind of fade out
I wiped off that brush and I'm gonna go
in with the Jade cat beauty baked
eyeshadows that I was talking about I
love this thing I'm going to use this
light shimmery pink shade right here and
this is gonna go in the bottom inner
corner
I'm gonna be applying falsies today so
I'm just going to give the lashes a
quick thin coat of mascara first you
could just wear mascara if you wanted to
if you're gonna do that go for Too Faced
better than sex mascara it is amazing I
don't know what's going on with my
concealer right here just patch it up
really weird like one of those moments
where you don't know if you try and fix
it it's gonna make it worse or better
well the camera was doing its thing I
pretty much ate this whole bag of beanie
toes
I think four lashes we're gonna do the
aisle or 126 lashes these are super
luminous super big I love these lashes
so I'm gonna apply these off-camera and
then I will be alright in fact we have
lashes on and bottom mascara for bottom
mascara I use the falsies push-up drama
feeling smoky feeling good for bronzer
I'm gonna go in with my honey bronze by
the body shop this is the great bronzer
if you have pale skin if you don't have
pale skin said this in my favorites
video but get the shade up because it
just blends out so beautifully and it's
amazing blend a tiny bit on my temples
for a highlight I'm gonna go in with the
city color cosmetics highlight trio and
my Sigma fo3 highlight brush this is one
their new brushes it is amazing it's the
perfect size for highlighting and this
city color highlight thing has also been
a favorite this middle shade right here
is great for pale skin this brush and
this will definitely be in my December
recent rejects this month there you go
can you see that I'm also gonna apply a
bit to my nose and then just right on
the bridge of my nose a little bit this
will also be in my race and rejects
video spoiler alert this is the Ofra
cosmetics pink satin microphone is that
so hard to say over a blush in pink
satin such a pretty color it's the
perfect light pink shade and I've been
wearing this literally every day this
with this brush by Real Techniques no
words look how easily that blends out
this blush has the perfect amount of
into it for lips I think we're just
gonna do like a pinky and dude situation
this is the Rimmel exaggerate
0:45 epic liner I love these liners
mostly because you don't have to sharpen
them half of my lip liners I don't use
because I just don't want to sharpen
them there enough like that this is like
a dark nadir I'm gonna apply this all
over the lips and then we're gonna put a
lighter color on top cappuccino
chocolate by Britt this is some kind of
chocolate it looks like a chocolate nut
and then they also if they're in a
chapstick it in here that's handy since
this New Year's it you want to use a
long-lasting lipstick so you don't have
to worry about it coming off there at
the night this is the Oprah Angeles yeah
Angeles liquid lipstick I've never tried
it on top of this shade so we'll see if
it's as light as I want it but this is a
beautiful kind of shimmery pinky nude
there's something to it though that it's
just so pretty
it just ordered Kathleen light's new
shade with them I'm excited
actually really liking that combo I feel
like this is like a perfect dark nude
shade I want a little bit more shine so
I'm going to go with this essence XXXL
shine gloss this isn't the shade at big
night out this is one of those glasses
that kind of adapts to the color of your
lipstick I've run this on top of a
purple glass and it looked a really
freakin cool I'm just gonna put a tiny
bit of this in the center a little it's
mostly alright so this is the final look
