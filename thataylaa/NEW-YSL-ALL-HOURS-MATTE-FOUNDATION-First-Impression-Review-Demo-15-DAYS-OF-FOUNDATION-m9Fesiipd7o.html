right so today it is day 3 and 15 days
of foundation I literally can't talk
today I think I've said every sentence
15 times days one and two are linked
down below in the description box in a
playlist along with past seasons of 1580
foundation today we're talking about
brand new foundation this is the YSL all
knows inch the full name for this is the
Y's L all hours full coverage matte
foundation hold on to your chairs folks
this retails for $58 and you only get
0.8 four ounces of product in here with
the standard foundation you get one food
out so you do get less than standard
foundation comes in 22 shades with
blighted shade being b10 porcelain the
only other wise self foundation I've
tried is the fusion Inc foundation which
I do really like have a pretty older
view on this thing comparing it to the
Maybelline foundation like this
the why self fusion a foundation I do
have the shade b10 porcelain ice wash it
on my cheek the other day before I order
this and it looked a little bit light
for me right now so I ended up going
with the shade PR 20 which is fair light
with neutral pink undertones I'm gonna
insert swatches right here at both of
these foundations weird to some of the
other foundation shades I own so you can
see which shade you might be okay so
swatch time right here is the YSL all
hours foundation in the shade BR 20 next
to it is the YSL Fusion ink in B 10
derma called 2:08 pur cosmetics bear
doll and porcelain urban decay naked
skin 0.5 and Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless in 110 but the description of
this says it's a new 24-hour raise your
hand if you wear your foundation for 24
hours full coverage foundation that
instantly blurs pores and fine lines and
provides uninterrupted flawless wear
that looks and feels like just applied
all day does it want cake dry flake or
fade transfer proof oil-free non pore
clogging
oil absorbing pigments I do have company
can I get oily throughout the day so
that solved the claims on this thing if
I'm gonna be paying $58 for less than an
ounce of product this is gonna have to
blow my mind if you want to see my
thoughts on the YSL all hours Foundation
and how it applies somewheres throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching okay I've already washed
moisturize pride in my face down below
the size for medium buildable coverage
use a sponge and then for fuller
coverage use a brush so like usual I'm
going to do one half of my face with one
half my face with the other brush I'm
gonna be trying it with is the elf
ultimate blending brush and this is the
morphe sponge that I love why is there a
black stripe down the side maybe that's
supposed to be like a design thing but
it kind of looks like it's just stuck on
there oh that was a good open close
that's like those drawers you know like
the soft close drawers so good okay so
I'm start with the brush on this side of
my face let's go in so the consistency
of this looks like a little bit thicker
of a liquid it's kind of moving pretty
slow in there whoa whoa okay that goes
we're really far really far
holy cease Oh smells like a why I
sell foundation if you don't like
fragrance you will not like this because
it's very fragrance but it smells like
kind of like a soap I rarely have to do
one dip of product period let alone to
get full coverage and that is covering
everything so within about 30 seconds it
seems to be definitely drying down Tamar
of a matte finish it looked a little bit
dewy when I was first applying it but
it's starting to like completely set
down to a matte finish I mean look at
this friggin coverage I'm gonna go in
with the remaining amount which is
pretty much the same amount of product
definitely getting lighter coverage with
the sponge way better coverage with a
brush and it goes way farther I'm gonna
switch back to a brush I just got way
too much out you need like the tiniest
amount of this I'm gonna cover this up
the fragrance like burning my eyes
probably still a spot conceal a tiny bit
on my acne been breaking out pretty
horribly right now I was looking at it
up close in this mirror and actually
when I get really up close it doesn't
look like total full coverage at all it
looks like solid high medium coverage I
don't love how it's sitting on my skin
right now but I also don't hate it it is
foundation you can see my pores a bit
more right
here it looks a little bit dry doesn't
look super smooth or anything around
this area
the fusion ink Foundation I don't set it
all and it wears beautifully throughout
the day so it's called the check-in time
8:20 I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and I'll be right back okay so it's now
854 that was pretty interesting to say
the least
so it went from mediocre not horrible
looking not great looking to level
about 8 out of 10 within like 15 minutes
basically what started happening was it
oxidized even more and then my forehead
started looking crappy before I
attempted to fix my face with powder I
took a clip in natural lighting so I'm
gonna start it right here so you guys
didn't see what my forehead was looking
like but basically started creasing in
my fine lines center of my forehead
looked pretty bad it kind of just aged
my skin and was kind of clinging to
weird spots
I had already applied my bronzer which
blend it out okay on top so at this
point I hadn't applied powder yeah I
definitely don't agree with the claims
about it instantly blurring ports and
fine lines so in an attempt to not make
my face and this foundation look
completely shitty I used the Laura
Geller balance and Brighton powder and
porcelain if I ever powdered my face in
a foundation video so with one of my
go-to powders this is one of them I know
how it wears how it performs then
definitely help to lighten my face it
matches my body a lot better now this
powder has kind of like a satin finish
to it so for the most part when I apply
this it does help to kind of smooth out
my skin a little bit make it look more
like skin less like creepy and weird my
skin is looking about 50 times better I
like how it looks right now I still
don't love how it looks even with the
powder on top of it but it doesn't look
bad at this point the makeup on the rest
of my face I use the bare minerals bare
Pro contour use the shade one right here
and I thought it was gonna be too dark
but I actually really like this as like
a bronzer for blush I use wet and wild
might I buy you a drink this was a very
pleasant surprise I don't even know why
I tried this as a highlight but I did
it's the new Mac next to nothing press
powder in light this is technically a
face powder I don't really like it as a
face powder but I tried this as a
highlight and I don't know if you guys
will be able to see that but it is like
the most beautiful subtle highlight if
you want a super natural-looking
highlight they're just gonna kind of
brighten up your face but it still has a
little bit of a glow this looks
beautiful as a natural
highlight choking on air right now maybe
powder to face of my eyes I just used
the same bronzer shade and then for the
rest of the eyeshadow I used the BH
Cosmetics essential eyes 28 color
eyeshadow palette this is like the cool
toned one I don't like this palette as
much as some of the others from BH and
lips I use Maybelline 105 nude whisper
liner I just put this all over my lips
and then topped it off with the L'Oreal
601 nude ballet gloss this is hands-down
when the best
gloss formula is in my opinion if you
haven't tried these L'Oreal lip glosses
they are amazeballs they feel so soft
and like buttery almost on your lips
it's everything that's on my face we're
gonna call the check-in time 8:30 since
that's about when I finished up my face
makeup and powder and everything would
it be a video without hiccups I'll see
you guys in a few hours for a check-in
and natural lighting I feel like there's
just powder like floating everywhere
right now that I'm breathing in so it's
now 157 - clucks that's been on for
about five and a half hours for whatever
reason I feel like when I do it reverse
like showing you guys in the mirror it
looks more accurate to how it actually
looks probably because the this is like
bouncing off so naturally though for
being a long-lasting mattifying oil
controlling foundation and using a
powder right now I'm looking pretty dang
oily after five and a half hours it
doesn't look like it's breaking down a
whole lot yet which is good like the
center of my forehead doesn't look like
it's separating it is taking up a little
bit around my nose right here my chin
looks pretty oily my chin doesn't
usually get this oily there's a little
bit of ever lip creasing - yeah I mean
you can see my pores and just how oily I
am right here you looks like it's
kicking up over here my forehead right
now doesn't look horrible besides the
oil I'm just i Lee but down here and the
rest of my face I do not think it's
looking good it also has continued to
oxidize throughout the day it's now like
two shades too dark at least but I'm
going to keep wearing this throughout
the day and I'll see you guys at the end
of the night just worked out I haven't
had the urge to work out in like months
comes I just have to write that train
you know what I'm saying so I stopped
working worked out and now we're here
looking great so it's 634 before I get
into the foundation update I just posted
the announcement video in my time today
someone on Twitter actually asked if
since there's no project Bashar
involvement this time around if you guys
can just donate to them and you
definitely can through their website
24/7 365 days a year so if you guys want
to do that on your own definitely feel
free to do that that would be amazing
you want to let them know you're part of
the Bay Rito fam just include a little
note in the Pay Pal thing so they can
kind of keep track of it but I think
it's awesome that someone asked that
that you guys want to do that so yeah
definitely feel free to that's amazing
but now let's talk about the foundation
so it's been on for 10 hours I looked at
it before I worked out and after and it
pretty much looks the same except right
here where I was sweating it kind of
like wore off a little bit more right
here same thoughts the entire day
overall I just don't like how this looks
on my skin or how it's wearing I am very
oily I'm assuming and now as time has
passed it actually is separating and
breaking down right here around my nose
area and on my chin and in the center of
my forehead this one I don't think works
for my skin it's not a foundation that I
would really want to try with different
putters just because there are too many
things that I didn't like about it on
its own as well especially for the price
personally I would pass on this one
I definitely like the fusion ink much
better if you have normal to oily skin
that one's great if you have dry skin
don't go for the fusion Aang I need to
pack for LA I'm gonna finish doing an
apartment tour if you guys follow me on
snapchat I just posted a secret little
giveaway for the snap fam so if you're
not following me on my social media make
sure you are because I'm gonna be doing
some random secret giveaways on there
