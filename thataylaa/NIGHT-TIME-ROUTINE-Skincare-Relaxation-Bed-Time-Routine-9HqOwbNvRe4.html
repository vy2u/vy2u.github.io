putting on the leopard robe is pretty
much always step one for me when I walk
in the door it can be eighty degrees out
and there's still a 99% chance it'll be
in a leopard row and I am gonna be
walking you guys through my current
skincare routine as well I'm showing you
guys what I've been using I feel like
this headband just describes my life so
I'm just tying back the hair the first
thing I do as far as my skin goes is
take off my makeup so I'm going with my
new trio makeup wipes I use these when
I'm feeling lazy if I'm not feeling lazy
I'll use the cleansing oil because I
feel like that actually does a better
job of taking everything off these
totally take off all my face makeup and
eye makeup it just takes a little bit
longer than the oil once my makeup is
all off I almost always go in with some
kind of face mask I have like 50 face
masks it's a little bit of an addiction
I have a problem I think I want to be
doing a whole video on my face mask
collection but right now this has been
my obsession this is the L'Oreal
appeared play Mass this is their new
line of face masks this black one rocks
I feel like it really detoxifies my skin
I'll even use this as a spot treatment
if I have some open acne spots once I
have my face mask on this is like my
time to do random things in my room wind
down and just kind of chill I feel like
warm lighting like this really helps to
relax me for some reason I usually turn
off my overhead lights and using
essential oils has become a major part
of my nighttime routine these are the
ones I use most often I get a lot of
questions on snapchat from you guys
asking if it's helped my migraines and I
don't feel like they've really helped my
migraines but it does help me to just
kind of relieve some stress and tell my
body to relax at night peppermint is
usually my go-to at night just I love
the smell of it just smells really
relaxing and clean and can we just take
a moment to appreciate this diffuser
that changes colors I'm obsessed I
usually like to tidy up and have my room
semi clean for the morning before I go
to bed so I usually put on some Pandora
kygo or
as usually and tonight I just had some
clothes to fold super exciting I usually
like to think about what I have to do
the next day so I whip out my Erin
Condren planner it'll just sit in bed
and kind of figure out what I'm gonna be
working on tomorrow used to be hardcore
into decorating the Erin Condren but now
I can just use it for planning this is
also when I do like one final social
media check so I will snap you guys the
tail of snaps if you're not following me
respond to YouTube comments on my phone
you know the drill and I'm just gonna
kind of tide you at my desk area I'm
usually really horrible at drinking
water during the day so I usually try
and drink a couple of these in the
morning then one at night before I go to
bed and this tumblers from Etsy by the
way I'm obsessed so once my face mask is
dry I wash it off obviously and then I
go in with a face wash so lately I've
been using the polished choice pour
normalizing cleanser this doesn't have
exfoliating beads in it it's just like a
gel cleanser and thank you to both
choice for collaborating with me on this
video I was actually able to get on the
phone and do like a skincare
consultation with them a couple months
ago and they recommended some of the
products they think would be good for my
skin which i think is awesome because
they have so many different lines
depending on your skin type so you can
actually chat online with someone on
their website or you can give them a
call and they'll like basically give you
a free consultation so I tried out a ton
of different products today I'm only
showing you the ones that have been my
favorite so these are the ones I've been
using every single night this is the
Paula's Choice BJ skin perfecting liquid
on my last skincare routine video a
bunch of you guys actually recommended
polish twice this was on the products
that a bunch of you said for me to try
out and I do really love this it's
supposed to help unclog your pores help
with wrinkles redness blackheads all the
good stuff I know this isn't what it's
intended for but honestly this gives you
the best dewy look on your face if you
apply this before your foundation it
makes your foundation look bomb and like
super glowy so then I go in with my Holy
Grail Shiseido moisturizer this is the
multi solution gel and I mix that with a
little bit of the resist
c15 super booster this is basically a
supercharged vitamin C formula that you
can mix in with any moisturizer or serum
that you already have and it's supposed
to help fade any dark spots I use it for
fading my acne scarring
I have a lot of that polish choice was
cool enough to give you guys a 20% off
link so that'll be in the description
box down below if you want to try any of
this stuff out you guys know I hardcore
struggle with cystic acne and I am on
spironolactone right now so I'm not sure
if that in combination with all these
products is what's been helping out my
skin lately so now I'm just putting on
some eye cream brushing the teeth
super-exciting and that is pretty much
everything that I do on my face any of
the stuff that you're seeing in my room
I did a full room tour if you want to
know where anything is from that I do
like to sleep with a hot pack every
single night on my neck of major and
neck migraine issues I just heat up my
stylish let live a little leopard I'm
like just realizing this my lips have
been crazy dry lately and aquaphor has
been literally the only thing helping
them then I go in with my hemp lotion
the nail salon I go to actually uses
this and I bought it because it smells
so freakin amazing then I go in with
this roll-on tension relief essential
oil which I do feel like helps my neck
tension it doesn't totally take it away
but if you give yourself really good
neck massage it does help to relieve
some of the pain so now we're just go
into bed
turn off the light I'm usually really
bad and fall asleep in bed while
watching YouTube videos on my phone but
this is what I do every single night if
you guys liked this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up let me know if you
want to see more routine videos love you
guys thanks for watching see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
