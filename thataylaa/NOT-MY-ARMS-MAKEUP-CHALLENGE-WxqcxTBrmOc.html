intense contour today for contour i'm
going to take the anastasia and Nastasia
contour it can i because that's what
everyone use this one do i want it don't
wings I'm like oh I'm gonna use the

gonna go really good under there
even more don't
you always wanna come from your near
always great tip no one ever talks about
that I don't know why it's really good

with the same brush and get really good
on the sides of my nose
mm-hmm this looks exactly like those
Instagram tutorials I see what do I want
to do maybe we need to take that powder
brush blend a little bit all over me but
I'm really good because we're gonna be

scene goods from Target it's like 10
bucks so great love it
now I'm going to go into my blending
brush there we go
lightly one left left left right into
the crease and if you get your eyebrow a
little bit yeah it just adds a little
more flavor to the look now I'm gonna go
with this red brown shade and put it
right on the brow bone you never know it

look and I'm gonna put this on the wall
under my lash line just to create some
definition under there No looks so good

home together
you just can't stop at the face and
don't forget oh brows how did I forget
about brow again go behind my head yoga
angled brush right here and yeah just
test it out on your face to make sure it
works okay since this look is so bold
I'm gonna go really wispy in the front
and then really dramatic at the end yeah
we really want some good shape here to
bring the whole look together where is
that for our
think I found it yeah it totally sounded
good so hard to flying abroad sometimes
now I'm just gonna go down there you go
I forgot my liquid liner so first we're
gonna go with this pencil liner and then
grab some liquid for this pencil liner
I'm gonna put this knot on my waterline
we're gonna skip
I think we're gonna skip the water but I
want to go right underneath there yeah
and that's it it's just so abstract
really get right in your under eye bags
oh I'm gonna reach back in the drawer
behind me really quick it and get some
liquid eyeliner there drawer all my
favorite positions formula i booster I

favorite part now I'm gonna go in with
some mascara I'm gonna first I'm gonna
find my lashes where my lashes I into
this brush in on that mascara get a
really good dip don't use the bottom
mascara I think you do just to bring the
whole whole look together putting my
scaring your brows can just help keep
them in place and add a little bit more
definition to them such a great tip give
it a really good swirl I want to look
like Jacqueline Hamill today this isn't
champagne pop but I think it's pretty
close
I'm gonna highlight the cheekbones
really intense whoa yeah so it kind of
evening the highlight on half of your
face and your nose don't forget the nose
don't forget the chin don't forget to
eat under nostrils Cupid's bow and on
your brow bone right on top of that
brown eyeshadow
they have a liquid lipstick so we have
some options here let me show you let me
show you all the options I could do a
red lip I think with Barney and I'm
biting you too much we have both right
here really great liquid lipstick we
have but don't want it today we have
Kylie and then we have another Kylie I
think I want to go yeah let's do this
fancy one so there might be 1/2 product
missing but it's okay you paid $40 for
it but you don't need it all anyway so
you're never getting is it also don't
worry it's Kylie mm-hmm really you know
I want overdrawn lips today because
that's what Kylie does you don't want to
miss any part so it's just gonna be too
obvious and it's gonna ruin the whole
look so now more that's in it I don't
know I think I'm ready to go out but it
might need some settings great you can't
forget settings but it's my favorite
hard candy doing miss you can go really
overboard with this too quick and I
don't want to go she's gonna ruin the
whole look you know it looks really
subtle right now so I don't want to go
overboard and they're not really good
with my hand Oh with my with my elliott
brush look at that do now that just
brings everything out with the
highlighter now I'm definitely looking
