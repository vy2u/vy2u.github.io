all right so today we're gonna be
talking about November raves and rejects
it has been one of those days major
adulting day I've been doing taxes
health care plan finding bills all the
fun stuff so I'm excited to just talk
about make up for a few minutes this
jacket keeps squeaking ASMR I'm gonna
have my raise and rejects playlist
linked down below if you want to watch
past months videos but let's start out
with raves like usual these are the
products I've been loving the past
couple months don't think I did one last
month I can't remember if you enjoy
raves and rejects don't forget to give
this a thumbs up so I want to say in my
raison rejects video maybe two or three
months ago I mentioned that I was
testing out an oil that I thought I
really liked but I wanted to keep using
for a while before I mentioned it and
that is this one it has made the cut it
is dripping everywhere because it's wet
this is the fresh sea berry skin
nutrition cleansing oil I actually have
two cleansing oils so this is the other
oil rave I've been basically switching
off between these two oils it's all I've
been using to remove my makeup oh I need
to say what this one is this is Paul
choice perfect cleansing oil I feel like
I have to say this in every video
because there are new people sorry if
it's a broken record but since being on
accutane accutane basically strips the
oil of your skin so my skin is no longer
combo or oily I am very dry I've been
using a lot of products and I'm actually
gonna be having my skincare routine
coming at the I think earlier I said the
two-month point but I'm gonna do a
two-month check-in and then at the
three-month point which will be halfway
through my accutane process that's what
I'll be really talking about all of the
products I've been using for really dry
skin well on accutane because I feel
like three months is a good time period
to really test everything out and make
sure it's really helping with everything
where was I going with that Oh since
being on acting skin is very dry so the
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes I
typically used to remove my makeup just
don't feel the best like tugging on my
skin those I like to use as like a final
step of just taking off my eye makeup
whatever these don't remove but both
these are pretty friggin balm for
removing everything I'm talking full-on
foundation eye makeup waterproof mascara
there's very little left over that I
have to use the Neutrogena wipes for
I've tried a lot of different cleansing
oils I think the one that I find most
similar to these is the Neutrogena one
in the
bluebottle I really like that one it's a
very lightweight both of these are super
lightweight oils I hate those cleansing
oils that feel just too thick and heavy
and you can feel like the greasy oily
residue afterwards
Paula's choice you get four fluid ounces
and the fresh you get five fluid ounces
so even though this bottle looks bigger
you actually get more product in the
fresh one
they don't irritate my skin and they
leave your skin with this not tight but
you know the look of those products that
leave you with that really glowy I don't
want to say tight but almost tight
without being drying like I love how my
skin looks right after I use these they
both give you that forehead glow you
know I recommend both these they're
super similar both balm if I was gonna
repurchase one I don't know man I almost
I'm leaning towards the polished choice
one they're both great this is like a
little sneak peek into the skincare
routine slash products video that will
be coming as a three month point but
after that this is another rave of the
month this is the CeraVe hydrating
facial cleanser this thing is so bomb I
talked about this in my Sephora older
haul video I've been using this every
single day morning and night I'll use it
in the shower I'll just like put a pump
in my hand before I get in the shower I
probably should get a second bottle and
put it in there but this thing was
friggin huge this is from the drugstore
you can get out also Walgreens CVS any
drugstore it's around 15 bucks to get a
 ton of product you get 12 fluid
ounces like this is a giant bottle right
here as I was in the shower using this
this morning I was trying to think of
the way I was gonna describe this to you
guys because it has a really unique
consistency to it and the best I can do
is that it's like a mix of a face wash
and a lotion almost it has this very
creamy lotion II feel to it but it
doesn't feel heavy and as soon as you
rinse it off your skin your skin just
feels so moisturized I feel like this
really helps to prep my skin in the
morning before makeup because it just
gives your skin this like coating almost
just really helps with my dryness and
everything and this has ceramides and
hyaluronic acid in it the ingredients in
here are really great it says for normal
to dry skin so I mean I wish I knew
about this when I was just because it's
that balm of face wash I always go in
with a toner or some kind of you know
product on a cotton pad after and when I
do that after I use this face wash there
is literally nothing on the cotton pad
and that's
rare usually there's you know some kind
of like tan thing coming off on your
cotton pad and this just takes
everything off if there is one makeup
product especially in the last couple
weeks that I've been talking about
non-stop I feel like you guys can
probably guess this it is the seotc a
summer love is it summer lovers summer
glow I can remember summer love blush
and I dug my nail into it so that was
fantastic there's like huge freakin
pothole right there I'm wearing this
blush right now I've been wearing this
blush every single day I kid you not
since I purchased this blush I have not
want to reach for anything else the
thing I love about this is the formula
it's not super pigmented it's more of
like a subtle blush but it still gives
you that flesh of color super easy to
blend out it just really effortlessly
blends with the other products on your
face your bronzer your highlight
everything it just kind of like smooths
everything out and blends everything
together it does have a slight glow to
it hence the name I personally love that
I don't find it to be shimmery to the
point where I just emphasizes all of my
texture and pores and everything I just
find it to be really flattering I am
definitely gonna be picking up other
shades this because the formula this is
like one of my favorite blush formulas
I've found so far if you want something
that's subtle and just super easy to
work with and blend out definitely would
recommend this also the packaging is
just adorable a little thing with stars
on it I mean we match all right so this
next thing is technically not a beauty
or makeup product but kind of let me
just show you it so this is actually one
of my favorite Amazon purchases I've
ever made I'm like so excited showing
you guys this right now so this is a
travel makeup bag let me get it in here
but not just any trouble makeup bag this
thing is so freaking cool I have some
stuff in it because I still have stuff
from Oregon here and then I'm leaving
again in like two days it is very flat
and very long so it is perfect
for sticking on top of your suitcase so
not even marketing it as this at all in
Amazon this is like the perfect makeup
bag it looks kind of semi small because
of its flatness but this thing is
actually the perfect makeup bag the
perfect everything bag and fit all my
toiletries makeup everything in here
because of all of the pockets
want to say this thing was like 15 bucks
on Amazon the thing that's really cool
is that they have the lined inside so
it's really easy to clean this is where
I would put my foundation so I would
just stick you can spit like five
foundations in here even though I'm
probably the only person on planet earth
who travels with five foundations but I
mean you can fit like five or six in
there this next pocket over fits brushes
perfectly you still have a ton of room
this this zipper right here this middle
one is expandable and also fit a sponge
in here too on the other side I still
have some stuff in here this one is like
fully waterproof which is awesome
because all those products that usually
put in ziplock bags or whatever that you
don't want to spill you can just put
straight in here so this is where I put
my face wash cream perfume anything
anything like that they don't want to
leak all over the place this is the
brand magic two door by the way who
knows but I'll have the link down below
along with everything else like always
this is where it gets really exciting so
this middle section is where I've been
keeping all of my makeup and I basically
have been living out this bag for the
last couple weeks and I will be for like
the next two months because I'm just
really not unpacking everything since
I've gone so much so this flips open you
have a pocket up here
I actually just kept my jewelry and
stuff in here you get this little pouch
which this one is also has a waterproof
material and then this is where I kept
all of my makeup and it's actually so
deep because it goes to the right and
the left you have two slots right here
we could also stick makeup brushes I
think that's what they're kind of like
intended for it there this fits
everything I mean it fit all of my
makeup and then some if you wanted to it
just hangs up and hooks like that you
also have this handle so you could just
hook it that way to whoever designed
this wonderful job phenomenal literally
one of my favorite things I've ever
bought off Amazon go Amazon the next up
these are one of my favorite pairs of
false lashes lately these are the Ardell
faux mink lashes you can get these from
the drugstore false lashes are one of
those things that it they just look so
different on everyone's eyes because of
different eye shapes and everything some
lashes that look bomb on some people are
just like above my eyebrows on me or
just look ridiculous so I personally
like kind of shorter ish but still with
some volume and drama
in there these ones are very much cat
eye kind of lashes they just give you
that look because of the shape they go
from shorter to longer and you have more
volume on the outer half so it just kind
of gives you that look I've worn these
in a bunch of different videos lately I
don't want to wear them today because I
wanted to be able to show you them this
is my last pack right now I need to
stock up but if you just search the
Tayla ardella 8:11 any videos that I'm
wearing them will come up along with
every other product you can always do
that because they list everything in the
description box but the thing I really
like about these lashes is the band is
so thin and typically with like the faux
mink look kind of lashes you get a
thicker band just because they tend to
be more dramatic and like full and these
you get a similar look but you still
have a really nice thin band next up is
a foundation that I'm sure you guys can
guess because it wasn't mentioned in the
last one because I had just recently
found it right before the last rays and
rejects but now that I've been using it
for I want to say like a month and a
half now at least I'm ready to talk
about it the moment is here so this is
the CYO long lasting life proof
foundation I have the shade 101 quick
overview of this on its own and then I'm
going to tell you how I like to wear it
so on its own I would say this is about
medium coverage very dewy very
moisturizing looks so beautiful and
smoothing and almost plumping gorgeous
foundation if you like that kind of look
also this foundation is like six bucks
around there five six bucks from
Walgreens CYO is exclusive to Walgreens
and I get it online that's the deal if
you wanted to wear this on its own for
me on its own it's not quite enough
coverage and the shade 101 I love the
tone of it it has very much like a beige
II kind of pinkish tone to it which I
love it's a tiny bit too light so really
like mixing this in with other
foundations to lighten it give it that
skin like dewy plump kind of look or the
way I really like to apply this which I
kind of accidentally discovered because
my foundation one day was looking too
dark is that I'll put the kind of darker
foundation whatever I'm wearing on and
then I'll just kind of go over it with
this just unlike the center of my face
I'll put it right on my forehead down my
nose my chin area and kind of like
around here just to brighten everything
up and it looks so beautiful that way it
just looks very fresh looks
skin just very flattering and with my
skin being drier this has just looked
beautiful
I actually have this on right now mixed
in with the maybelline superstay this is
actually the old formula I talked about
this in last week's foundation Friday
video update if you missed that video or
didn't check the description box the old
formula is way different than the new
formula still love this one 5 billion
times better than the new formula but
check out that video if you want to know
my thoughts this foundation I would pay
30 bucks for it that's how good it is to
me a bunch of you have snatched me and
messaged me saying that you pick this up
and you also love it so if you try this
out let me know what you thought of it
down below because I'm always curious if
you guys pick stuff up what you think of
them
my most reach for lipstick this month
since I tried it out in I think as that
shadow moves our first impressions is
definitely the Maybelline Gigi Hadid
Tora lipstick tarah still has it ta you
are a whatever whoops I layered it the
other day so I the tip looks darker than
it actually is
well let me wipe this off alright and
the chance that I ever made a nude
lipstick this is pretty dang close to
the shade I would do if you are around
my skintone it is so flattering because
it's not too light it's not too dark
it's almost like my exact lip color just
a little bit more cool toned which is
great because I'm always looking for a
lipstick like that that will kind of
cover up any foundation or whatever you
know just like even out your lips after
you put on all of your makeup and that's
what this is for me I freaking hate the
smell Maybelline lipsticks
it's like crayon and blueberries or
something mixed nude lipsticks look
different on every single skin tone so
if you have a deeper complexion than I
do don't you know expect it to look
exactly the same
I just love it's not too matte it's not
too creamy it lasts pretty well on me
like it'll last for a few hours it's not
gonna last our eating and stuff it's not
like a super long lasting liquid
lipstick or anything I've talked about
this before fairly recently in the
extreme coverage foundations video but
this is the Smashbox photo finish primer
water and I've just kind of refle and in
love with this thing and the past few
months it's bomb underneath makeup it's
bomb over makeup it's what I have on
right now over my makeup just to get my
skin more of like a glow add some
moisture and everything back in you are
looking dry and crepey or if you just
have a matte foundation that's just not
looking great on your skin this thing
really helps at least for me I don't
find that it breaks me out it's
free alcohol free and oil free the only
thing I don't like about this is the
smell it literally smells like a Barbie
doll this is one of those facial sprays
that I feel like actually makes a
difference I like that you can use it
over and under your makeup so those are
all my rays for the month I have three
rejects here that I feel very strongly
about this first one I literally despise
glossier let's talk about glossier for a
second you guys saw I test out there boy
brow in a video this is another glossy a
product that I was not into at all so
this is new by them it's the body hero
oil daily oil wash is what it's called I
love the packaging of this super cute
glasses when those things to me that I
really want to like because I like their
whole vibe I like their branding I like
their packaging and I can't tell if a
lot of people like them because of that
or if they actually have some really
great products and I'm just not trying
the right things I've tried their lip
balm you know and like the squeeze thing
lip sell whatever that's called
I've tried their body hero and the boy
brow all three I'm not into I don't know
let me know down below if there are some
other glossier products you think I
should try out but let me talk about
this because this is the reject so like
I mentioned in the Sephora Ulta haul
video I got these ceramide and dr. jart
body oil that I've been really into and
I wanted to just try out like an oil
kind of body wash it had really good
reviews on glossy but a lot of people
were saying that it was a very strong
scent and a lot of people it seemed like
by the reviews either loved the scent or
absolutely hated the scent and I am
definitely in the group that absolutely
hates the scent this literally smells
like the most strong bathroom potpourri
on the planet oh my god I won it
literally just almost gagged besides the
smell because that's obviously something
that just depends on your nose in your
personal preference I don't find that
this thing does anything as far as like
moisture and being a body oil and a
cleansing oil whatever I don't find it
to be that moisturizing at all the scent
lingers so much to the extent that it
smells like I am a bathroom walking
around all day after I use this if I use
this I can't really wear perfume because
all you smell is this it smells like a
perfume on you I just don't really feel
like this does anything as far as being
moisturizing or being a wash if anything
I would call this like a shower perfume
I've used this probably 20 times at this
point 15 to 20 times the first few times
I use this I couldn't really tell what I
thought of it and the more I used it the
more I felt like it didn't do this
is a major note for me especially for
the price like I'll just stick with my
Nivea and Olay washes they are very
moisturizing very cleansing next reject
of the month is also by CoA oh we had to
see why you rave here's the CYO reject
this is probably one of the worst
eyeshadow palettes I've used in a long
time I did a whole video testing out CYO
makeup oh this is not the eyeshadow
palette I grabbed the contour kit where
the heck is the eyeshadow palette
alright I just dug through everything
and I cannot find it I have a rejects
bin that I put products in every month
to talk about and I think I actually
only put the contour kit in there
instead of the eyeshadow palette no idea
where the I showed up how it is floating
around but I'm gonna Sur a picture of it
right here basically they were the most
chalky not pigmented just everything you
don't want in Nice shadow they were
pretty horrible there are great eye
shadows from the drugstore that are a
few bucks a wet and wild little eight
pan things that have been around for
like a decade now those are great and
they're like 5 bucks
this one is I mean bad like worse than
the Claire's makeup worse than 99.9% of
eyeshadows I've tried CYO has some great
foundations but they're I shadow 's and
the single ones need some major work the
single ones like the metallic ones also
not that great very chalky wouldn't
recommend those either
so my last reject of the month is one
that just didn't work out for me this is
the tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
so many comments saying maracuja not
marriage Zuka I think I called it tomato
tomahto so I have the shade fair I tried
this out and shot orange mousse I still
have the box because I am gonna be
returning this because I can not make
this work for me so this is a very very
very thick can
Seeler I mean you gotta like really put
all of your effort into squeezing this
out to get like a DAB I've used this
about three four times since filming
that video and every time my under eyes
just look horrible the formula this
reminds me a lot of the it cosmetics bye
bye under-eye the squeeze tube one
almost exactly it's super thick that one
also creased on me really badly but a
lot of people love that so if you like
that concealer you might like this one
this one just really didn't work for me
my Maybelline fit me it's actually right
here this one has been working great
I've been saying that I was looking for
something more moisturizing and I kind
of just went back to this one that I've
had for forever and I love and it's been
working really well I have it on right
now so this one is going back so those
are all my raisin rejects for November /
just since the last time I did one of
these I hope you guys enjoyed this if
you did make sure you give it a thumbs
up by the way on the rest of my face for
eyeshadow I used all of the Urban Decay
Naked heat shadows and all them all of
my eyeshadows there from here highlight

bronzer and in my lipstick is colour-pop
