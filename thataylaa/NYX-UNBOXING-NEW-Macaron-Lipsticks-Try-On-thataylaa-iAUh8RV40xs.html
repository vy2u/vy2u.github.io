I am unboxing my next box finally this
freaking box has been sitting in my room
for like week now I finally have time to
film I haven't sat in front the camera
in like a week and a half so all the
videos that you guys have been seeing
have been pre-recorded surprise so as
you've probably heard Nick's came out
with their new macaron lipsticks which
are these crazy shades of lipsticks I'm
all about the crazy colors so when these
came out I was super excited to try them
I ordered them literally I think like
the hour after they came out online
they're here and I'm so excited I
obviously have one on my lips right now
I'm filming this intro after I did the
whole filming of the unboxing got a
temporary tattoo situation going on just
go with it
who doesn't love butterflies holding
hands tried to do the hair like ten
different times post shower hair it
wasn't working out so I just put a
shit-ton a bobby pins in it called it a
day so this is just gonna be a casual
kind of unboxing swatches first
impressions kind of video on the next
products I ordered so if you want to see
that then just keep watching
we're excited to finally be opening this
you don't know how much self-control it
took to not open this box with macaron
lipsticks in it so I don't even remember
what I ordered
dropping online addict this is gonna be
a surprise for me too
let's just open it up okay I don't even
know how to open this fricking box like
a jigsaw puzzle so no one else really
box challenge seriously think I'm gonna
phone a friend pretty soon right
okay guys Rache save the day the box is
now open there you go that's a hell of a
lot of bubble wrap comes in this little
lace bag which is super cute I've
ordered from the next website before and
I still have this bag fun fact
so NYX came out with some new macaron
lipsticks which have super crazy colors
I've heard really good things about
these so let's try them on I'm gonna
start with the shade black sesame
because I'm super excited to try this it
reminds me of max Stone lip liner it's
kind of this weird like grayish tan
color kind of feel like a ghost right
now but I feel like this could be
combined with like a black lipstick or
something to do like an ombre lip it
went on super smooth the formula feels
super creamy so here is black sesame the
next one I got is rose which is this
super bright pink lipstick it kind of
reminds me of Mac st. Germain looks like
it has a little bit of a cool tone to it
I love this one this is definitely a
cool tone pink I feel like this is a
really cool pink to wear like going out
or something so then I got the shade
pistachio which is this bright ass green
shade because I just feel like you have
to buy a green lipstick once in your
life you know looks kind of like a teal
green tone holy
I know this one is like super crazy for
the average human being but I'm kind of
obsessed with it obviously isn't like an
everyday kind of lipstick shade I don't
think any of these really art but if
you're really into makeup and you're
like a makeup artist or you just like
crazy lip colors then good for you I
think this shade is amazing the color
payoff is great it's super creamy
definitely looks more like teal blue to
me than green or then pistachio but I
really like this one time you don't want
to take this one off the next one I got
is lavender and it is this pretty bright
s purple color I have some other purple
lipsticks and I really like purple lips
I'm all about him this one was a little
more cool toned and lighter than my
other ones so I had to get it
hell yeah
I'm kind of surprised at how creamy the
formula of these are usually with
colored lipsticks you tend to get a
little bit drier of a formula these feel
like a completely normal lipstick
formula super creamy super nice loving
it so those were the four macaron
lipsticks that I got now I kind of want
to buy all of them so I ordered two
other things from NYX I think you had to
spend like a certain amount to get free
shipping and I already wanted to try out
this foundation which I'll show you in a
second so I was like let's just go all
out and get a lip liner too you know the
lip liner I got is 850 nectar and it
looks like a an apricot kind of color I
usually drawn to this kind of shade so I
don't know if I I don't know what I was
thinking when I worded this but it's
nice I feel like this could be paired
with with the NYX soft lip cream in
Stockholm yeah this is like the exact
color of the soft lip cream those two
paired together would be a super nice
combo so then the foundation that I
picked up is the NYX invincible fullest
coverage foundation and this is in the
lightest shade do I need to say that
anything that says full coverage on it
sign me up possess it it's a super
fantastic coverage that leaves the skin
satin matte and flawless comment down
below if you guys want to see a first
impressions video on the next invincible
foundation that was everything that I
ordered off of the NYX websites when the
macaron lipsticks came out comment down
below if you guys have any shades of the
macaron lipsticks that you think I need
to get for sure I really want to try the
blue one and the black one because who
doesn't need another black lipstick it's
not like I have five if you liked this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up so
I know
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
