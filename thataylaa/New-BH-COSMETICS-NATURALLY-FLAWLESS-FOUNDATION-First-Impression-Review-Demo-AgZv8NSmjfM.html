is foundation Friday so I try out why is
this I like Hillary this is where I try
out a new foundation every single Friday
on my channel 6 p.m. Pacific time so I
mentioned that this one was coming this
is the new BH Cosmetics naturally
flawless foundation
here's box I actually have three shades
here so I'm gonna swatch all of them for
you guys in a second by the shades 201
which is the lightest shade 204 which is
the second lightest shade and then 205
obviously third lightest shades and I'm
filming this it's actually I think
they'll like Black Friday sale so this
foundation right now is five dollars and
fifty cents it's normally $8.99 and you
get one fluid ounce of product which is
standard right now this comes in 18
shades the lightest 201 and the darkest
is 232 deep expresso espresso espresso
so let's read some of the claims on this
thing it says get a radiant complexion
this is a reef formulation they had this
foundation in the past apparently says
reformulated with the addition of
hyaluronic acid which keeps your skin
hydrated provides lightweight medium to
full coverage natural satin finish this
foundation is vegan and cruelty free so
I'm gonna start swatches of these three
shades compared to some of the other
foundations I own just so you can see
how they all compare all right so swatch
time right here's the BH Cosmetics
foundation in two zero one two oh four
and 205
here's dermal called two zero eight one
of my closest shade matches milk makeup
blur liquid in fair Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 I don't like
this on eye only swatches so you guys
have like a reference from a drugstore
foundation and then CYO life proof and
one zero one alright so that is
everything that was a Hello quick intro
I feel like so if you enjoy foundation
Friday and you're excited for this video
don't forget to give this a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m.
Pacific time if you want to see my
thoughts on this foundation you're in
the right place just keep watching
alright good morning guys it is 8:07
a.m. I'm filming this this week I think
the pre-recorded foundation Friday
videos from before starting accutane are
gonna be starting next week because I
still have like five or six
those already edited and everything
unless there's like a new release I'll
pop that in and film it like I am right
now the video you guys saw when I said
it was a month on accutane was actually
filmed a couple weeks ago so this is
like a month and a half right now here
we go
so I've already washed and moisturize my
face like I said in the and a couple of
foundation Fridays ago I'm not priming
because I kind of found a good
moisturizer sunscreen combo that just
works well underneath makeup for me
right now at the dryness and everything
and my skin has been doing good like not
super dry I think the products I'm using
are really helping they don't really
have any major dry patches or anything
right now which is great a tiny bit
right here like on the sides so I
haven't swatch these yet so I'm gonna
see what the shades 201 and 204 look
like dude I've had like one sip of
coffee today oh that looks pretty light
I'm gonna do Oh what just happened okay
so that wasn't screwed on so make sure
you let us go down before you pull it
off or your hot foundation everywhere
awesome I'm really glad that didn't land
on my pants because I need to
desperately do laundry and this is like
my one clean pair of pants right now
these do you have a pump and it's a nice
glass bottle feels like really nice
glass nice and thick I think I might be
204 by the way just jumps from 201 did
you go forth on half my face I'm gonna
use my la girl sponge that I'm obsessed
with and on the other half I've been
really liking this a cosmetics brush I
don't know if it's worth $40 I think you
get the Sigma f80 for half the price and
it works amazing it's really great
quality but this one is very nice and it
happens to be my most clean foundation
brush right now this is supposed to be
medium to full coverage doesn't have a
scent at all like at all which is nice
okay so when I first put it on it was
looking like a little bit separated or
something and I don't have any oil on my
face by the way but now that I'm
blending it out it seems to be doing
okay definitely more on the light
coverage side you can still see all that
stuff coming through but let's add a
little bit more bring it down the neck
the shade looks pretty good looking at
my neck so while we were doing this
since this is like one of the only
videos that's not pre-recorded for the
next couple weeks I
just want to say a huge thank you to you
guys for all of your love on Tuesday's
video I'm so happy you guys like the
designs I feel like I didn't say enough
what I wanted to say in that video so
I'm just gonna say it now but I really
wanted to make clothes that people would
actually want to wear like even if you
didn't know the reference or whatever it
would still be a cute shirt you know
what I mean
I didn't want to like slap my name on a
shirt or just put text on the shirt and
sell it to you guys like these are
designs that we actually worked really
hard on making tonight and we're really
happy with them so I'm really glad that
you guys also like them I wanted to say
the sizing it seems like people were
kind of confused there is plus-size
every single design does have to excel
in it and some of them have three XL and
go up to five XL I think some people
were confused because when you use the
fit finder it doesn't for some reason
bring up your size so if you just click
buy now or whatever that button is it'll
bring up all the sizes and you can see
it and teespring I think does have some
kind of sizing chart and stuff to just
on their website so I'll link those down
below so just wanted to let you guys
know that ok foundation not looking bad
not looking great let's try this sponge
I think I got about highlight coverage
maybe low medium coverage I mean a lot
of stuff is still coming through so when
you guys are seeing this I will be in
Oregon and this is like the start of all
of the trips I'm gonna be coming back
and going a lot basically through
January I've been doing a ton of
pre-recording I'm still doing 3 videos a
week and I almost have them through like
middle of December right now oh man you
know and you have like is such an
intense itch so my dad is coming to
Oregon I'm gonna be filming a video with
him so that video will be going up I
think on Monday or Wednesday of next
week
so get excited for Papa Bear Rito back
in action ok so I like how this looks on
my forehead right now like it looks nice
and kind of smoothing the finish of it
definitely looks better with a sponge it
looks just a little bit like textured
and things on this side maybe slightly
lighter coverage on this side so I'm
gonna see if we can build this up just
on my acne and stuff done here Oh
this looks a lot better from far away
not looking good on my chin area around
my pores it looks almost like Gracie or
some things even on like one and a half
layers I'm doing thin layers by the way
I would say you can build this up to
medium coverage but it's like a low low
medium coverage so it's clinging kind of
weird around my nose right here I'm
gonna do that same thing that I did in
the concealer video because it seemed
like you guys liked that where I used
this camera and just showed you really
up close so all this is still coming
through it looks greasy like oily it
doesn't even look dewy it almost looks
this reminds me of the unique foundation
did a review on during 15 days of
foundation this is giving me flashbacks
a sponge side overall definitely looks
better
even after smoothing out the brush side
with a sponge afterwards here's my
forehead forehead I don't think looks
bad I have a feeling it's gonna get some
separation right here cuz I feel like I
can already see it tiny bit here's a
little you what time is it it's 825 now
so I am NOT gonna powder my face because
since I've been on accutane powder is a
no foundation on me has been holding up
great throughout the day because they
don't have like oils coming through and
powder just looks so bad on any of the
dryness and stuff just like emphasizes
everything I'm gonna do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back alright so
it's now 848 so we're gonna call the
check-in time 8:30 since that's about
when I finished up my face I just did a
super basic makeup because I have to go
to physical therapy in like 20 minutes
and I just realized I think I'm wearing
the exact same shirt as last week's
videos and I think I like the sounds of
the same but pretty much my go-to makeup
look in shirt apparently kind of same
thoughts I did only end up setting this
part of my face just because it felt
very sticky and tacky I definitely
wouldn't be able to blend product on top
of it my thoughts are exactly the same
right now don't love it don't hate it it
just looks kind of natural glowy super
contrary is the Anastacio light to
medium contour kit I haven't used this
and so friggin long I just took that
middle that middle shade right there
blush
I accidentally dug my friggin nail into
my favorite thing at the moment this is
a summer glow so sad it was so beautiful
highlight I used the CYO shimmer switch
in the clouds I just use like the two
lighter shades right here and that's
what's on my inner corner as well and
then lipstick I used Mac strip the next
check and I do will be a natural
lighting because I think it'll be early
enough that this one won't be down yet
hopefully so I'll see you guys in a few
hours so right now it's 140 so it's been
on for a little over five hours okay how
does my phone already up 14% I went to
the chiropractor I've been vlogging I
just filmed a little holiday haul so I
didn't actually think I was gonna be
doing like a face down adjustment at the
chiropractor but he did I didn't really
have the same that tried to get out of
it
just for the sake of the foundation but
it actually didn't transfer at all I
looked at the paper thing on the
adjustment table when I got up and there
wasn't any makeup on it so that's a good
sign it didn't really transfer even
though it feels kind of like sticky yeah
it's like not really transferring to my
hand at all a little bit it's weird
my chin in like cheek area again I do
have a little bit of powder over here
but not down here but my chin looks way
more matte than my forehead my forehead
looks pretty dewy almost oily which is
weird to see because I don't think I've
seen that since starting accutane though
I can only imagine how oily I would be
right now with my other skin where
they're standing when my skin was combo
I'll probably be a greaseball right now
all right so here's real up close I
don't think it looks the best on my
pores and oh yeah I just don't like how
it looks right they're racing a little
bit around my nose I feel like that was
there when I first applied it not
getting any lines up here so that's good
I'm getting a little bit of like
something going on right here and also
in this area looks like there's a little
bit of separation happening looks like
it's settling into my lines a little bit
it's funny I can't actually see that in
the mirror but I see it on this friggin
HD camera so I will check back in with
you guys at the end of the night okay so
it's now 651 so it's been on for over 10
hours right now though I'm definitely
quite oily and I know that because in
the last a month and a half I haven't
seen my face look this oily at all so I
can only match
and like I said if I had my only skin
right now this would be a greaseball I
don't love how it looks in the same spot
it says last time around my nose and
down here I'm gonna zoom in doesn't look
horrible but it's definitely breaking
down separating a bit on the center of
my forehead so this one even though it's
only between five and nine bucks or
whatever it normally is I don't really
think it's worth it I don't think it's
that great it's there's just foundations
that definitely look 50 times better is
it the worst foundation ever definitely
not do I recommend you buy it probably
not it's kind of my thoughts on this I'm
so tired right now I don't know how I'm
this tiredness my 7 o'clock yeah I don't
think I have anything else to tell you
guys trying to think of something to say
but I've been blogging all day oh I feel
like I don't even know what I've said to
each okay video camera but if you guys
enjoyed this video and you're enjoying
foundation Fridays don't forget to give
this a thumbs up I hope you had a great
Thanksgiving I realize this is actually
