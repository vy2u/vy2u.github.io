me crave like pancakes who wants to go
to IHOP
all right so today it's day 15 a 15 days
of foundation it's here another season
has come in in a few months
comment down below for your new baby doe
and you found my channel through this
series this time around say hey down
below if you are new here my normal
schedule after 15 days of foundation is
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time I have been pre recording since
when you guys are saying this I'm gonna
be out of the country but I will have
Monday Wednesday Friday videos starting
this coming Monday jumping back into it
at the end of each 15 days of foundation
serious I do like a wrap-up ranking kind
of video where I rank all the videos 1
to 15 I've been recording these 15
videos since over a month ago at this
point so I have been trying out the
foundations in between recording I was
originally gonna do the wrap-up video on
Monday the 25th but I'm gonna be pushing
it until Friday the 29th there so I have
a few more days to try some of the
foundations out or finishing off this
series with a drugstore foundation sorry
there haven't been a lot of drugstore
foundations this time around usually I
try and like do half half just the way
that the foundations were coming out
with the new releases and everything
most of them happen to be high-end but
this is a new release by Burt's Bees
this is the goodness glows liquid makeup
I don't think I have ever tried a makeup
product from Burt's Bees I don't think
so I used to always wear they're like
white chapstick
he's on my how I did my makeup in high
school video you know what I'm talking
about
I'm gonna link that in the I over here
because it is quite the gym but I think
that's the only Burt's Bees product I've
ever purchased in my mind they're more
like organic natural but this is
supposed to be a full coverage
foundation which I thought was very
intriguing I went on a friggin manhunt
to find this foundation in time to
record this video lighter shade was sold
out on Ulta couldn't find it in any
stores they do have it on Walmart but I
ended up getting it on Amazon thanks to
one of you guys who tweeted with today's
shipping so we got it in time so this
foundation retails for 1699 on Ulta
which is pretty freakin pricy for the
drugstore I feel like that's priced a
bit high you get one fluid ounce of
product which is standard it comes in 12
shades I have the lightest shade which
is one zero zero five porcelain the
description of that is fair skinned with
cool pink undertones so I'm gonna start
swatches right here so you can see how
porcelain compares
my other foundations alright so swatch
time I just did swatches for the fen TPD
Foundation which was day 13 if you
missed it so I'm just gonna keep this
super ridiculously long arm full of
swatches going so first right here is
the Burt's Bees goodness clothes
foundation and the lightest shade one
zero zero five porcelain next to it is
Kat Von D l42
fenty Beauty foundation in 100 110 and
120 milk makeup Blair liquid foundation
lightest shade fair derma called 2:08
Urban Decay Naked skin and 0.5 and pur
cosmetics bear doll and porcelain again
here's all of them next to each other
alright so some of the claims wow they
have a freaking paragraph on here it
says is a full-coverage mineral makeup
that leaves skin smoother and more
radiant with a natural finish that's
never heavy cakey or greasy this 98.9%
natural moisturizing foundation
instantly hydrates and nourishes the
skin and stays on all day it says it's
perfect for dry or combination skin so
it should be good apparently
across-the-board and Burt's Bees is
cruelty free I would hope they are if
they have a name Burt's Bees I think the
packaging is cute they have this like
honeycomb situation on the top and then
it's just a glass bottle and there is a
pump yay
so that's all the claims if you've
enjoyed this series of 15 days of
foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up I appreciate it
go ahead something else to tell you guys
let's put this on my face if you want to
see what I think of the Burt's Bees
goodness glows liquid makeup how to
apply somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching
just coming back the hair I wash my hair
last night I'm Ellie I'm finally getting
to the point where my real hair is like
healthy again after attempting to go
gray great decision party wash
moisturize and primed my face I just put
a tiny bit of the Revlon Photoready just
right on my pores I'm gonna use a brush
on one side of my face this is my Sigma
f80 and my morphe sponge on the other
that's just shake it sounds like a nail
polish I'm getting my lashes filled in a
couple days so they're looking a little
wonky right now but I think I'm gonna go
back to like the more I liked the first
I'll I got where they were like more
along and separated okay that's what the
shade looks like this might actually be
too light well I have one shade so we're
doing it it's gone for the sponge on
this side just to switch it up
oh it smells I just wash my sponge okay
wait
I'm really hoping that's not the
foundation because it actually smells
like bad this is pretty light so if
you're fairer than me yeah it could have
gone up a shade it's definitely not
looking like full coverage with a sponge
and I'm getting some weird clinging
right here for being a glowy supposed to
be radiant with the natural finish it's
looking pretty dang matte like I'm not
seeing a glow really at all not looking
the best on my forehead is definitely
clinging in certain areas like it is
down here okay let's show you the brush
this smell what the heck is this I'm
getting better coverage with the brush
it looks friggin matte I was expecting
like a super glowy
I mean it's called friggin goodness
glows it is going pretty far like one
pump is covering my whole face Oh yikes
I'm gonna try and get up close and dim
that I'm looking in the viewfinder and I
feel like you can even see the weird
like clinging and stuff okay not looking
great I'm gonna add a tiny bit to see if
I can like smooth everything out make it
look a tiny bit better hopefully so I'm
gonna go back in with a sponge a little
bit of product does go a long way so
that's a plus okay this side is looking
much better now that I just did that I
feel like it's pretty easy to have this
be kind of streaky like you've been
using it with a sponge it's kind of like
you can see the sponge marks it's still
clinging really badly around here it is
looking better on the thin second layer
still doesn't look good I would say you
can get full coverage with this on two
layers not off of one so this one feels
too tacky to blend like I think I'm
gonna have to set my face with this I
would not be able to put anything on top
of here and that will also help to
darken up my face so I can wear this
today because I definitely got too light
of a shade so right now it's 1108
do the rest I make up and I'll be right
back alright so it's now 1138 we're
gonna call the check-in time 11:15 since
that's when I finished up my face I set
my face the laura geller double-take
baked powder this is what I use if I
want to kind of dark in my face a little
bit and also smooth it out and this
definitely helped my skin looks much
better right now than it did with just
the foundation on I still wouldn't say I
like how my skin looks or that it looks
good I feel like it looks pretty mask
like and it kind of feels like it shall
have the texture on the center of my
forehead and the powder did kind of
smooth out this area for the most part
at this point I would not wear it again
looks pretty horrible on my skin on
first application so unless this wears
really well throughout the day or
something I don't really see myself
reaching for this again even I was like
a mixing kind of product but it is
definitely much more wearable now that I
set my face with the powder I warmed up
my face with the hourglass luminous
bronze light bronzer right here I also
contoured slash bronze with the Catrice
Prime and Phi and contouring palette I
love this shade blush I use Tarte buff
and I also put these two in my eyes this
is all I have on my eyes with the
highlighter the highlighter I tried out
for my face and eye spots on my lids
right now is the Milani strobe light
moon glow I think this is new from them
I picked up a different product from
Milani the foundation their new light
shade which will be coming in a video
since I was already on there I picked
this up it's pretty I feel like it is
one of those highlighters that
emphasizes my texture a little bit and
then lips I used B hue pretty penny and
they did just hook it up with the coupon
code for you guys you can get 15% off
with the code I want to say Taylor 15
I'll have it listed down below in the
description box but be Hughes the brand
that I collaborated with for 1548 and to
this day they're still one of my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas
they're bomb so 11:15 check-in I'll see
you guys in a few hours and natural
lighting ok so right now it's 4:11 I
took off my lipstick because I've been
laying on the hot pack and that that
looks like a giant Hickey we can just
ignore that but looking at the
foundation my face I think looks pretty
good right now I like how it looks I
like the dew eNOS coming through I mean
I'm definitely getting oily it doesn't
look like quite as matte as it did a few
hours ago but I don't mind
I think it looks nice right now I think
the only area it looks a little bit
heavy is like around my nose in my upper
lip so let's even guys in I still think
it looks a little bit like mask like on
my face right now
my forehead doesn't look bad it
definitely has looked a little more
natural but yeah you can see the
creasing like around my upper lip and
then just around my nose it looks
definitely heavy right here I'll see you
guys at the end of the 917 p.m. so it's
been on for 10 hours and from far away I
can tell in the camera it looks pretty
nice right now and it does look good
from far away like even when I look in
the bathroom mirror right now but when
you get up close I'll leave guys in it
looks like you could dig a friggin nail
into my foundation right now looking a
little rough am i right
so it's definitely separating on my
forehead and it looks very cakey heavy
around here and my chin area is
definitely separating and it's also
gotten quite patchy like you see it kind
of rubbed off right here where I was
lying down and then around my mouth a
little bit
it just looked it's a very patchy all
over here also on this side my forehead
has definitely looked better I'm not
like overly oily I've definitely got an
oilier throughout the day I mean that's
typical for me I wouldn't say this made
me super oily or anything but I've
definitely seen my skin look better
overall this one I didn't initially
really like anything about it I didn't
particularly like how it's worn
throughout the day or anything so I
don't really see myself using this one
even as a mixing foundation I don't like
the finish of it on its own I don't like
the patchiness how clung to certain dry
spots I wouldn't really call this a
radiant finish at all if you have dry
skin I can just see this cling to
everything so this one is a pass for me
unfortunately ask you guys on Facebook
and Twitter for recommendations for
other drugstore foundations you want to
see review they haven't been reviewed
yet I reviewed a ton of drugstore
foundations I feel like at this point
always check by searching the Tayla in
the name of
Foundation and it'll come up if I have a
video on it but there are a lot of new
people here who I guess don't know but
some of my favorite foundations are drug
stores so it just happened this time
around that in a series there weren't a
lot of drug stores or review drugs
review drugstore foundations reviewed
but they'll definitely be more coming
I love drugstore makeup pretty sure I
have more drugstore favorites and
high-end favorites so wrap the video
