all right so it has been a hot minute
since I've been excited about eyeshadows
foundation the face products are my
thing I love a good eyeshadow but just
doesn't quite get me going in the same
way but these I felt like I needed to
make a video on because I haven't been
this excited about eyeshadow since the
Anastacio Modern Renaissance palette
these are the new color pop single
shadows I have this palette here I've
just plopped them into a deep palette
then I also have the low maintenance low
key and high maintenance there we go I
also have those two palettes Before we
jump into all about the color pop
shadows I'm actually doing a half face
kind of comparison in this video to this
palette so what you're seeing on my eyes
right now
one side is the anastacio modern
renaissance palace the other side is all
color pop shadows they don't want to
just talk to you guys about how
somewhere the formulas are and
everything I wanted to actually show you
I'm gonna do swatches of all the color
pop shades and swatches of the ones that
are similar to Anastacio shades they
aren't as vast color dupes I'm also
wanted to focus on the formula of these
because the first few times I was
playing around with the color pop
shadows they immediately reminded me of
the Anasazi ones these are technically
called color pop pressed powder so if
you're on their website and you're
confused
is under the pressed powder tab I have
my sticky note here with some masks so
color pop single shadows retails for
five dollars you get point zero eight
ounce of the product just to give you a
little bit of comparison the makeup geek
shadows retail for six dollars a pan and
you get point zero six four ounces of
product we actually get a tiny bit more
product in these and they retail for a
dollar less the Anastacio Beverly Hills
single shadows retail for twelve dollars
and you get point zero five ounce of the
product you can actually get masked
shadows for six dollars of pan now so
the same prices makeup peak but they
have a point zero four ounces of product
in them color pop you're actually
getting the most for your money and it
is the cheapest out of all those even
though I'm talking about the Anastacio
palette today comparing some of the
shades and everything is not going to be
breaking down the price per ounce and
everything in this palette because this
is a palette when you pay for single
shadows you're paying for more products
you're paying to be able to create your
own palette whole thing about these
palettes is that they retail for $18 you
get four shades in them and this is how
they come they actually don't have a
name on the back of here there's no name
on the actual packaging or on any of the
shadows inside even though they do sell
these shadows individually as well 18
dollars so you get four shades you get
$2 discount on the shades and you also
get this which doesn't look impressive
just off the bat but the super cool
thing about this someone actually told
me this in the comments on a different
video that I use these you can take out
this overlay the silver thing you
literally just get tweezers peel it out
and this is a totally magnetic backed
palette so you can create your own
custom palette using this this will fit
ten shades so you're essentially getting
a free Z palette with your four shadows
when you purchase these so I just think
that's awesome we're going to quickly do
some swatches I'm going to swatch all of
these shadows that I have from
colour-pop and I'm also going to swatch
them next to similar shades from the a
BH palette then I would say aviators
that's something you should take let's
go swatch all these and then we're going
to jump into the actual look
you
Oh
all right so before we jump into the
next part cast your votes down below
which side you think is which can you
tell the difference let me know which I
you think is which down below all right
so I'm filming this video the same day
as a primer first impression video which
I think this video will be going at
first so sorry that there still may be
construction going on that you can hear
came to the office to film a few
different times and every time there's
construction so we're just doing this
but I'm gonna start out by priming my
eyes I'm gonna use Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot so I'm going to do this I the
anastacio Modern Renaissance palette and
then this I will be all color pop single
shadows like you've seen from the
swatches they're not all exact matches
I'm not saying that they're colored oops
I just really want to see how similar
the formula is because just from playing
around with these the past few days I
feel like the formula is pretty similar
let me start out by taking this orange e
shade I'm going to put the exact name on
the screen since this is from the
low-key palette they actually don't put
the name on the back up here even though
these are sold individually so that's
kind of annoying we take that shade on
this eye and then burnt orange from the
Anasazi appellate the colour-pop
eyeshadows have similar kick up when you
put your brush into the pan but as weird
they actually don't have a whole lot of
fallout at all when you actually blend
them onto your eye going into this burnt
orange this one actually had a lot more
powder kick up by the way the brushes
I'm using are always listed down below
there are certain morphe brushes I
recommend there are others I don't so if
you're going to purchase from morphe
just know that the ones that I'm using
today are the brushes that I use for my
eyeshadow every single day so this is
the m5 11 no idea what kind of look
we're going for I'm just going to use
whatever shades are similar enough to
use so I'm going to go in with 9 from
colour-pop and then take Cyprus umber
number number two no I'm just putting
this mostly on the outer third kind of
smoke it out a little bit it's only had
a half a cup of coffee right now on my
functioning / filming to videos thing
that reminded me initially of the
Anastacio palette was that these
especially with the deep shades the
colour-pop shades you can put on and
they don't totally blend away which is
exactly what I like about the Anastacio
palette
they're not difficult to blend out but
they also don't just totally go away
when you blend them out
with Cyprus over here I want to take one
of these super red shades to put in the
crease a little bit there are two kind
of brick shades from colour-pop
one came in the low maintenance palette
and then one is the shade demand popular
demand
yes popular demand neither of those are
- color dupes for red ochre but I think
once we blend them out it'll work
where did my brushes go I think I'm
going to go in this popular demand first
and see how it works I was going to
blend this kind of right on top of the
brown into the crease a little bit more
to warm it up this is the e 17 brush by
the way and then the other one I win
with was the r39
I'm going to go back and blend the edges
with a different brush so don't worry
now go in with a red over hmm whoa that
one is very pigmented okay that one's
definitely more pigmented you 27 and I'm
just going to blend that out I thought
it was a little bit more of both colors
I'm going to go back in and blend again
with all this blending the Anastacio
Cypress timber shade is holding up a
little bit better I'm going to go ahead
and add a tiny bit more of the brown
shade from colour-pop reigning house it
rained in Seattle in like two days okay
I really think these are looking
indistinguishable right now Vermeer and
Primavera these two shades right here
not those these two shades right here
are kind of hard to do those are really
unique colors to me which is weird
because they just look like a light
pearly pink and a light champagne but
it's a bicolor pop from the low meanest
holiday I'm going to take and then I'm
going to go and let's Primavera on the
other side I don't think they're going
to be exact but we'll see I'm going to
go in with my Coastal Scents brcs 250
the color top shimmery shades to me
could have been a little bit better they
feel dry a little bit they don't feel
like the makeup geek foiled shadows they
don't have that creamy consistency to
them but when they're actually on your
lid they're still pretty so let's take
Primavera on the other side yeah this
one has a little bit more gold to it
this looks more champagne silver to me
I'm going to take a tiny tiny bit of
save it for later my color pop just to
get that gold
that's matching a lot closer I'm going
to blend that those two pillars together
a little bit and then I think I'm
actually going to wet my brush and go in
with a little bit of those lid shades
just to get it to really pop back in
this color pops favorite for later and
I'm just spraying a little bit of urban
decay setting spray on there okay
because they're looking pretty dang
similar definitely thought the shade was
called tempura this whole time tempura
tempura this shade if I remember
correctly isn't totally matte kind of
like a satin has a sheen to it so I'm
going to go and with that under the brow
bone on the side and then color pop
doesn't have an exact shade like that
but they do have a matte one I'm going
to take the shade here me out put in
this right under the brow to do a lot
take the color pop shade both of those
are pretty much the same color as my
skin tone so doesn't do a whole lot kind
of want to use these magenta shades for
the bottom lash line actually you know
I'm going to use this kind of muted
taupe light purple shade this is the
shade of a fresco and then taking color
pop made to last so far no fallout from
either sides going with foam fresco over
here those look identical I kind of want
to do a purple winged liner I've never
tried this Jordana liner so this could
be a total fail actually have I feel
like I've tried this a while ago this is
the Jordana cat eyeliner in 0/3 orchid
I'm actually not going to wing this
because it doesn't look super pigmented
so I think it might just look weird if I
attempt to wing it I was going to kind
of flick it out at the end you have to
go over this a few times though so I'm
going to put on lashes finish up the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
alright so the rest of my makeup is on
i'mma tell you guys what I used on the
rest of my face lashes are my Kara as
for lashes you can get these for a
dollar on my Kate house or shot miss I
can't remember which one I'll link it
down below if they're dollar lashes they
rock they feel exactly like our dolls to
me for contour I use the new Physicians
Formula bronze booster contour the shade
right here how they did this new white
shade from Physicians Formula this is
super intense so I literally just use
the tiniest bit to get a little bit of
the glow if not you're going to be like
beaming covergirl trublend blush and
medium rose and then list I actually
really like this combo have never tried
this color from colour-pop this is the
colour-pop ultra matte lip
in the shade naughty and then when it
was still a little bit tacky I actually
dabbed a little bit of a color pop
eyeshadow in the center just to give it
like that lighter look right in the
middle for that I used to shade a
Firefly all the products that are on my
face right now except the face products
like foundation and primer and stuff
will be linked down below in the
description box that video will be
coming next shade wise I think both
sides look pretty much identical when
you swatch them you can see a slight
difference in some of the shades that
when you actually blend them out and put
them on your eyes you wouldn't be able
to tell formula I love the color pop
matte shadows if you're just starting
out you want to try out a few of the
color pop shadows I would go with the
matte ones I think the formulas the
matte ones are amazing the shimmery ones
are just kind of average to me once you
wet them and they're on your eyes they
look fine they're just not mind blowing
or anything do you think the deep brown
shade was a little bit easier to blend
out on the Anastasio side other than
that if they look identical to me so if
