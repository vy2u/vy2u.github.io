think is day 12 yeah yeah
all right so today it is day 12 of 15
days of foundation this is why I try out
a new foundation every single day for 15
days 6 p.m. Pacific time I did the thing
yesterday
anything looked different so the lip
ring is a goner after 5 years I loved it
we had a good run but I was just ready
to switch it up so I got my nose pierced
instead I actually had my nose pierced
before I ever had my lip ring I also got
this piercing in here
but anyways felt like I should probably
address that since you stare at my face
every day so as you can see from the
title today's foundation is the new
dermablend flawless crater mixing
pigment drops multi used liquid pigments
technically what's called oh you
get a ton of product in here this
is impressive
these pigment drops retailed for $40 but
you get one fluid ounce of product in
here which is amazing and the cover FX
drops you get half that amount you get
half a fluid ounce and the cover FX
custom cover drops retail for $44 so for
half the amounts this is actually a
really great deal so I've tested out a
few different pigment drops we did the
hard candy ones in a different series
but the idea with these is that they're
basically drops that have higher
concentrated pigment so usually you can
mix them in to add coverage to light
into dark and foundation or you can use
them on their own so you can either mix
it in with the primer moisturizer
whatever you want so I typically like to
use drops I'm mixing them in with
another foundation just to give it that
extra umph you know I'm saying get these
on Ulta reading some of the claims it
says it's a blendable buildable
customizable weightless foundation drops
with 33% liquid makeup pigment this
lightweight foundation provides
buildable and blendable coverage with
the water free oil-free foundation
formula use a loner mix you can use one
drop minimum for lighter coverage four
drops for maximum coverage I think you
can mix in however much you want mix in
their supposed to last 16 hours so it's
come in 20 shades at the lightest shade
which is 0n I'm gonna serve swatches
right here of the shade zero and
compared to the custom cover all words
just like went out of my brain compared
to the cover of X drops in the shade and
10
okay swatch time right here is the
dermablend flawless creator drops in n0
the lightest shade next over is the
cover effect drops in n 10 so the
dermablend drops are actually quite a
bit lighter and a bit more neutral which
can be great for mixing or lightening or
just wearing alone if the
shade milk makeup blur liquid foundation
in the lightest shade fair Urban Decay
Naked Skin Foundation in 0.5 derma
called to 0-8 and pur cosmetics bare at
all in porcelain the packaging on this
is really nice it's a glass bottle but
it feels really kind of like lightweight
almost and it has a nice dropper to it
as well it doesn't look like it's gonna
get quite as messy as a cover FX one the
cover FX dropper is pretty horrible I
don't even think this really cool thighs
is the dropper it just like gets
everywhere so that's all the plans if
you want to see what I think that the
dermablend flawless Creator drops and
how they apply and wear throughout the
day your night please just keep watching
right so when I'm filming this I just
posted day 4 I think it was and a lot of
you guys were very concerned with the
primer I pinned a comment in that video
and it's already like what 7 days later
but since this is the first time I can
talk to you guys on camera about it I am
gonna switch up the primer in this video
even though like I said in the pin
comment it's not the primer that's
affecting the foundation like the bare
minerals one in the first few days
because I have already tried those
foundations with this primer looked the
same so just for you guys we will switch
up the primer and use the Revlon
Photoready pore reducing primer because
lately this has been my other go to
primer if I'm not using the hilum I'd
matte 12 this one I just like to put on
my t-zone mostly I do put it all over my
forehead but on my face down here I just
put it kind of around my pores chin and
nose a little bit it's been so long
having a nose piercing I don't even
remember what it's like to put on a
foundation with it so this will be fun a
piercing guy said that putting makeup on
should be fine just keep like a tiny
little ring around it actually really
like the packaging of this kind reminds
me of the DCM ordinary it's like usual
I'm gonna try my ELF ultimate blending
brush on one side and then my morphe
sponge on the other so the way that I
tested the hard candy mixin pigment
drops was by mixing it in with the
covergirl clean matte BB cream because
this is too dark and it is very
mattifying long-lasting it's one of
those foundations that I just know
exactly how it performs it looks
beautifully on my skin and I feel like I
have a good idea of mixing stuff in with
this how it affects it like most
pigments you can mix these in with
moisturizer primer but the cover effects
drops they're pretty dewy so I like
mixing these in if I have a super
mattifying foundation that I just want
to make a little bit more dewy and add
some coverage I'm gonna start out with
about that much of the foundation I'm
gonna shake these really well because
they sound super liquidy I'm gonna start
with 4 drops and see kind
how alters the shade and stuff one two
three four whoa bye oh it seems to be
lightning it really well so start on
this side with brush so the covergirl
foundation does oxidize a bit on me so I
like to mix light which is why it looks
a little bit light right now but my face
will oxidize it once I have bronzer and
everything on it'll match fine so I can
tell that these drops are met these are
not like glowy dewy drops like the cover
FX ones which is nice to have a
different kind of finish
you see we drops that I can mix in if I
have a really dewy foundation that I
kind of want to mattify a little bit
okay so let's try the sponge on the
other side and the covergirl foundation
I forgot to say is medium coverage on
its own okay my forehead looks 50
billion times better with the sponge and
now my foreheads looking good overall I
think I like the sponge side better and
I got the same kind of coverage I do
think it added coverage to the
foundation since it's normally medium
but I do still have some acne stuff
coming through doesn't seem like quite
as much coverage off the bat as the
cover effects drops do usually when I
mix in the cover effects drops it makes
any foundation like full coverage so I'm
just gonna go over with a sponge down
here and build it up a little bit just
to see if we can get more coverage does
seem to be building we're at full
coverage now I think it looks really
nice my face is super matte right now
but it doesn't look heavy matte it just
looks really nice right now it's 9:02
we're gonna call the check-in time 9
o'clock I'm not gonna powder my face
with this because I never put on my face
with the covergirl clean matte it lasts
amazing throughout the day if you have
oily skin this stuff is amazing for
mixing in for using alone if you like
just lighter coverage it seriously lasts
forever without a powder it's amazing I
want to just drop this on my hand really
quick to see if it still looks really
matte on its own yeah so it is
definitely Matt is our Matt drops so I'm
gonna do the rest eye makeup hopefully
the lawnmower will be done by the time I
come back and I'll see you guys in a few
minutes all right so it's not 10:17 I
got kind of sidetracked doing things for
Instagram I finished up my makeup
probably like half hour ago that's been
on for a little over an hour at this
point I did
end up setting my face to the powder
like I said it looks really good I was
just like out snapping and natural
lighting and looking in the bathroom
mirror and everything and it just looks
very smooth and it feels super
lightweight which the covergirl
foundation does but I don't feel like
the drops add to any like weight or
heaviness or cakiness to it I feel like
they mixed really well and just
lightened it and added a little bit of
coverage so right now I'm feeling them I
feel like the only thing at this point
that can happen is if it for whatever
reason if these possibly break down the
foundation by the end of the night or
something because this does hold up
really well so we'll see but right now
I'm feeling them I would definitely use
these again especially with like a super
glowy foundation if I want to like tone
it down and modify it a little bit or
something but on the rest of my face
what did I use bronzer I used the elf
bronzing palette I just went in with
this shade right here in the corner I
guess they're all in a corner flush I
use the BH Cosmetics floral blush and
that's what the inside looks like these
are really nice they're super pigmented
this isn't the shade bahama bronze
highlight I used a Smashbox Kasey Holmes
palette I really loved this highlight
it's like growing on me every time I use
it guys I'm also using cloud this is the
pixie it's Judy time palette this is a
beautiful freaking palette like I feel
like this is very underrated the matte
shades in here
I like the shimmers too but I feel like
the mats are what's special all my
eyeshadows are this palette oh I put a
little cream liner on my waterline which
I haven't done in forever I used to do
this every single day this is the color
pop honey honey dude I think that's this
honey dude this just helps to like open
up your eyes in college I remember I
think it was sophomore junior year yeah
I used to do that every single day I
remember my makeup faces in college by
which apartment or house I was in at
that time lips I used that la girl
ultimate lip liner in non-stop nude and
then wet and wild liquid cat suit and
nudie patootie one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks ever that's everything I'm
just gonna be working I think I might
try and go get my nails done cuz these
are looking pretty ratchet and I leave
for London I'm going to London just feel
like I haven't told you guys that I'm
going to London on the 15th super
excited but it's very soon so I need to
get my together
again the check-in time is 9 o'clock the
next check and I do will be in natural
lighting
I'll see you guys in a few
ok it's 2 o'clock so it's been on for 5
hours right now got the nails done not
sure how I feel about this color but I
like the shape I did like more oval this
time I just get acrylic with shellac on
top I'm not sure what color shellac this
was I forgot to look
but anyways foundation so it looks
really great
everywhere except I'm getting creasing
on my upper lip and then it's rubbed
away up here where I've been like
pushing back my bangs I was doing you
guys so here's the upper lip creasing my
cheeks and everything look really nice
in my forehead I think looks good except
for right up here I'm microwaving ramen
see it just rubbed away right there I
don't usually get lip creasing when I
wear the covergirl matte and I also
don't really remember it like rubbing
away so I would attribute that to the
drops I think other than that I think it
still looks good my oil is holding up
really well underneath here still and it
looks smooth and I like it oh by the way
I changed shirts I'll probably change
again cuz I'm getting dinner with my
friend tonight
I think I'm actually gonna have this on
for a really long time tonight because
I'll check in with you guys after dinner
ok it's now 8:40 so it's been on for
almost 12 hours which is a long wear
time not really doing what normally I do
10 hours
Makaveli a little bit tipsy right now
just got back from Rachel's ginger-beer
which if you're going to Seattle you
should go to Rachel ginger beers I know
I get so many questions about what to do
if you're coming to Seattle if you're
visiting so I think I'm gonna ventually
do a video on that or like a blog post
or something let me know if you guys
wanna see that so again this light like
bounces off that's what you guys are
seeing right there but my oil looks
really good right now in real life like
when I look in the mirror maybe you can
see without that like reflecting off but
I have like very very minimal oil right
now which is typical for the covergirl
so don't feel like the dermablend drops
really made me any more oily necessarily
this is like amazing for me with the
mayor just in front of my face the whole
time I think it was as far as oil this
is pretty amazing for me at 12 hours my
face isn't separating it all on my
forehead it is a little bit around my
nose and by the way before I left I just
went over my upper lip with a sponge
just so I didn't have major creasing
since that's going out so here's what my
skin looks like after 12 hours for me
this is great
yeah I don't feel like the dermablend
necessarily broke down my face anymore
or made me more oily than normal which
is great I want to compare these kind of
side-by-side with the cover effects just
to see which has more coverage because I
do feel like it added coverage but for
the amount that I used I feel like I get
a little bit better coverage with the
cover of X drops it definitely added
coverage it just wasn't quite as like
maximum coverage I feel like if I would
definitely use those again if you want
mix and pigment drops but you like a
matte finish these could be really great
for you I feel like they're one of the
few matte finish mixing drops I've ever
seen most of the other ones I've tried
are definitely more on the dewy side I
feel like they show you n0 is a perfect
lightning shade for me 90 degrees why
I'm wearing jeans oh I got games tonight
three people I think I'm gonna do a fall
haul video after 15 years foundation
because I've been doing I should send
shopping anyways I feel nice I'm excited
to keep using them and see which
foundations I like it best with but I
would totally wear this combo again I
think it looked really nice throughout
the day
no major complaints yay we got a good
one
so if you guys enjoyed this video and
you're liking this series don't forget
to give this a thumbs up it helps me out
and I appreciate it a few more days left
to 15 days of foundation love you guys
thanks for watching see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
