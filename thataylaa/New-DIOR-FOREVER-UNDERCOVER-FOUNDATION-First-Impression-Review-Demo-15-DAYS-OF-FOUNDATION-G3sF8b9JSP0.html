so I got to put it out there so thank
you guys for your support and your

see how this whole thing turns out
alright so let's move on to the
foundation day one so the first
foundation we're gonna be trying out is
the brand new Dior skin this is
obviously a little sample which I'll
explain about your skin forever under
cover foundation the name forever under
cover just makes me think of Quantico or
like Carmen Sandiego good show if you
haven't seen it this is new I'm actually
filming this video in February so it
just launched right now I never really
review like the samples I always
purchase the full bottle but I had the
full bottle in my car and Sephora and
then I saw they had the deluxe sample
sizes so I trashed the full bottle got
the samples which is why we have this
and I actually had the lightest shade if
I do like it I'll end up just purchasing
the full bottle so the full-size
foundation retails for $52 but it has
one point three ounces of product which
is a little bit more than standard one
fluid ounce it comes in 24 shades I have
a light
which is ten ivory which says very light
with neutral undertone also got the
shade 20 as a sample there's a few
shades in between 10 and 20 14 15 does
it 14 15 but I'm also gonna swatch this
one since I have it and says this for
all skin types
24 our full coverage water-based
foundation supposed to be the most
extreme wear foundation yet from Dior
full coverage lightweight formula with a
natural matte finish says it contains
the highest level of pigments out of any
do our foundation almost twice that of
the original forever fluid foundation
for an even fuller coverage it's
supposed to be like second skin and I
think that's pretty much it so I'm gonna
search swatches out here so you can see
what the shades 10 and 20 look like next
to some of my other foundations alright
so swatch time right here is the dew our
foundation in the lightest shade 10 next
over is the shade 20 and these both have
already oxidized since I first watched
them I can see it as it's drying to the
center where it's still a little bit
more wet is about a shade lighter than
the outside or it's already dried down
next over is the NARS radiant foundation
in the shade and Mont Blanc I have a
whole video on this along with every
other one of these foundations
derman called 2:08 which is my closest
shade match Tarte rainforest of the sea
foundation in porcelain Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless in 110 I don't
like this foundation at all I only
include it in swatches because it's a
fair shade from the drugstore that you
can compare to and then milk makeup blur
liquid in the lightest shade fair if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the burrito family
and subscribe I'm uploading every single
day 15th to 29th 6 p.m. tip time let's
do this alright I cannot believe this is
happening right now it's day 1 so it is
10:30 a.m. when I'm filming this it's
actually February 8 I've already washed
moisturize and prepped my skin I'm gonna
have the products linked down below I'm
not gonna be doing a half face with the
primer in this series because basically
all I've been doing is my usual
moisturizers and then I just put like 2
spritzes of this in my hand and just
kind of like Pat it all over my face and
that's pretty much how I've been wearing
my foundation every single day so that's
just basically to get my skin to a state
where it's nice and moisturized and
ready for foundation I'm gonna start out
with the shade 10 I've read the lightest
one because that's what I was in the
star foundation I'm gonna shake this
just in case supposed to be full
coverage in 24 hours of where I'm doing
my use my huge I'm gonna doing my usual
10 hour wear test looks a little bit
dark on there
we'll see how this goes this is a
lighter shade so I'm gonna start out
with my dampened Real Techniques sponge
on this side of my face
this one does feel different than they
used to it feels very thin like super
lightweight has a major scent why the
heck does Durer always do this their
star foundation smells like perfume and
this one does too
very heavily scented I just hate that
much fragrance and foundation this looks
beautiful on the skin with a sponge whoa
it feels like I have nothing on my face
right now like it feels super super
lightweight it's giving pretty good
coverage definitely it doesn't look like
full coverage with a sponge it's not
really covering the scarring on my neck
okay so from far away like when I was
just looking in the mirror it looks
amazing when I look really up-close it
looks a little bit patchy in certain
areas and it's actually like clinging a
little bit on my forehead up here bye
let's see what happens with the brush so
my skin is more normal to dry right now
I'm on 1/5 of accutane but right now my
skin is more just really on the normal
side off the bat definitely better
coverage with a brush but it still
doesn't look like full coverage you can
still see stuff coming through I would
say this is medium coverage the way they
describe this made it seem like super
super ultra double pigment full coverage
and it's definitely not this is
definitely a clinger like I said I don't
even have dry patches but just to
certain areas of my face where there's
more texture you can just kind of see it
sitting there around my nose it doesn't
look the best I'm gonna get really
up-close it's weird cuz I'm from far
away just like from a foot away when I'm
looking in the mirror it looks beautiful
it's just when you look really up close
that it's like whew
I'm hoping it's picking up on what I'm
really seeing in real life you can see
some of the clinging happening right
there and in this area look at the
center of my forehead looks very clingy
dry can you see that texture right there
seems to be already starting to crease a
little bit around my mouth area
if this doesn't oxidize I think the
shade actually works for me on camera it
looks like it matches it is a bit dark
in real life but not to the point where
it's too dark I'm gonna go in with the
sponge without product on it and just
try and kind of
smooth out my forehead and any of the
textured areas okay that didn't do a
whole lot still looking pretty crappy
yeah it's just a clinger as far as the
finish when I first put it on it looked
a lot more satin matte right now it
looks like more of just kind of a true
matte maybe like a soft matte it's not
the worst it just doesn't look
particularly good on my skin right now
one thing that I do like is that doesn't
feel super sticky and it doesn't seem to
be transferring at all when I just touch
my face typically I'll only set this
area of my face so that I can blend
powder products on top but I don't even
feel like I need to do that I'm gonna do
the rest of my makeup and I'll be right
back okay so now it's 11:40 we're gonna
call the check-in time eleven o'clock
since that's when I finished up with my
face makeup no idea why my makeup just
took me this long
I feel like day one I'm always like
false lashes full on makeup and by day
15 it's under eye bags and mascara so
pretty much the same thing as far as the
foundation this foundation has gone
through some phases I feel like when I
first put it on it looked very smooth
had a really pretty satin finish looked
really lightweight and now that it's
been on my face it looks pretty heavy
and a little bit cakey it's not looking
good so right now in my skin I'm not
liking this one but we'll see if it kind
of warms up to my skin throughout the
day hopefully I'm gonna start a clip
right here what it looks like in natural
lighting and then we'll do a flash test
this is what the foundation looks like a
natural lighting it's hella gloomy and
like dark outside right now even though
it's the morning not sure how the
lighting is gonna be but let's zoom in
so as you can see it looks pretty dry
and crusty up here camera has been
having a rough time focusing lately are
you okay bro look at that cover FX
highlight though all right so let's go
do a little flash test I'm hungry
it doesn't look bad it looks pretty good
with the flesh it looks nice and soft it
actually it's really flattering on
camera fifty thousand times better with
flash on than it does in real life so on
the rest of my face for contour today
use makeup geek this pan is friggin
magnetic what is the shade breakup cold
porcelain and blush I use a zoeva I
think the shade is shy beauty but this
is the zoeva blush I got this off of
Blaine by it's a super pretty like
peachy pink shade highlight I've been
obsessed with this this is the
coverfx moonlight highlight all of my
eyeshadows I'm wearing today are from
the blue it's going flying more feed 25g
palette this is a great palette 24 G not
25 my lashes are I'll or 1 21s now my
lips I did a combo of the black art
plush liquid lip this is actually from
Hot Topic I just did a whole video
testing out Hot Topic makeup and then
just on the middle I put on a little bit
of the healthy lip Physicians Formula in
all natural nude just to give it a tiny
bit of more warm tone to it next check
and I do will be in natural lighting so
I'll see you guys in a few hours
here right now so it's now 4 o'clock for
4 so it's been on for 5 hours it looks
about exactly the same as the last
check-in except now I'm getting creasing
on my upper lip oh by the way I filled
off my lashes so there's creasing
they're there on the other side too on
my upper lip and everywhere else looks
about the same if not a little bit worse
yeah it looks like the creases have
gotten worse right there I'm gonna check
back in with you guys at the end of the
night ok so I got a little sidetracked
and is actually now lips 1103 it's been
on for 12 hours this is a long way tests
I'm wearing a different fuzzy team
jacket I think you might even be able to
see on camera from here I'm gonna zoom
in I have been working on the computer
and I had my hand like this and that's
how I work almost every single day
normally my foundation doesn't come off
at all because I'm not like rubbing it
and it is a hundred percent rubbed off
right there like to the point where you
can see kind of where my hand mark was
and where my concealer stops that's
pretty extreme that completely came off
and then you can see the other side
which has a little bit rubbed off down
here but not anything like this side so
if you're looking for a transfer pure
foundation this definitely is not it not
only that but it feels dry like it's a
feels like a dry powder so it's weird
that it transferred that much besides to
transfer it it's a little bit hard to
tell on camera but I do think it's
oxidized about a shade maybe half a show
you to a shade it hasn't oxidized orange
which I like it's just darkened a bit I
mean the forehead and everything
looks exactly the same as last two
check-ins it just still looks pretty
heavy
kakie so this one for me is a know for
sure I'm really glad and purchased the
full bottle of this for 52 bucks this
might be one that looks great if you
don't have any kind of texture on your
face just go into it knowing that it's
definitely a matte medium coverage not
transfer proof if I really wanted to
like Salvage last few drops of the
sample bottle I would put on definitely
some kind of like smoothing primer
underneath definitely super dewy setting
spray over top it just has that look to
it though where I can tell it's still
going to be a cleaner I hope you guys
enjoyed a one if you did and you're
excited for the rest of the series don't
forget to give it a thumbs up the series
