microscopic well on the planet let me
tell you alright so today it is
foundation Friday but we are actually
switching it up today and talking about
a concealer that I'm so excited about
because this is a brand new release I
tweeted this the other day when 2020
would wouldn't reading we would posted a
picture of this and it was so freaking
excited to see this in my mailbox last
night this thing hasn't actually
launched yet it launches on December 3rd
this is the brand-new Urban Decay all
nighter concealer so I do have a review
on their foundation I also have a couple
of their videos mentioning it slash
using it I only like the foundation
mixed in with other products I find it
to be very heavy on my skin it looks a
bit cakey concealer retails for 29 bucks
$29 to me is pretty pricey for a
concealer I mean that's the price of
some foundations like high-end
foundations you actually got a tiny bit
less product in this concealer than The
Naked skin concealer and this one you
only get 0.12 fluid ounces of product
and in this you get 0.16 fluid ounces of
product so two lighter shades are fair
neutral and fair warm to give you some
shade reference I am the shade fair
neutral in the Urban Decay Naked skin
I'm gonna serve swatches right here of
the two lightest shades that this comes
oh my god I have tried to say the
sentence twenty-seven times it feels
like okay this is the winner
I remember swatches right here of these
two lighter shades this concealer
compared to some of the other shades of
concealer own I'm gonna let these kind
of dry down for a couple minutes before
I show you the swatches because these do
darken and it says that so I'm gonna
give all the concealers a couple of
minutes to just chill there
alright so swatch time these have been
on for about a minute and a half maybe
two minutes now so right here is the
lightest shade of the Urban Decay all
nighter concealer in the shade fair warm
next way is the shade fair neutral right
here is the Tarte shaped tape in the
shade fair maybelline instant age rewind
concealer in the shade fair this is way
too dark for my under eyes I like to use
it to spot conceal on my face though
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
1515 is actually lighter than 10 but
this is obviously way too dark for my
under eyes too but I like to mix this or
I can lighten it with the powder and
then last is Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the shade
fair neutral which if you look at the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
compared to these two it's quite a bit
lighter at least a shade lighter than
both of these I'm kind of surprised that
they came out to darker shades then the
original naked skin concealer but there
are some swatches it says the concealer
that will change your life that's a big
statement this is a full coverage
waterproof concealer that's matte and
it's supposed to last all day and all
night
covers anything get a perfectly blown
out effect which are pigmented controls
shine which is interesting if you want
to use this on your t-zone and your oily
maybe this will help kind of control
your oil throughout the day we'll see it
says it even covers tattoos I don't have
a tattoo to try that out on yet but you
guys will see what I think of the
coverage in the demo part of this video
it comes in 14 shades and it says a
little bit goes a long way it says that
this doe foot applicator has a little
well or what interesting it says no need
to carry a brush our angled flocked
paddle applicator has a little well at
the end that provides a precise lay down
a product exactly where you need it
hey this looks like a friggin doe foot
applicator to me let me try the other
one you can off all the product to be
able to see what they're talking about
if there's a well it's the most
microscopic well on the planet let me
tell you as far as the packaging of this
I love it I'm all about it
I like the gunmetal I like the little
crisscross see things this reminds me of
like Hunger Games so that's that so
that's all the claims I'm gonna do my
usual kind of first impression and wear
it throughout the day for about 10 hours
like it would with a foundation so if
you enjoyed while you're watching don't
forget to give this a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the baby
doe family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m.
Pacific time alright so I'm using a
different camera right now so that we
can get really close and you guys can
really see my eyes look a little bit
funky right now because I obviously have
nothing on this eye area and then I
brought my foundation up and over my eye
on this side so when I apply a concealer
this is what I usually do I usually just
bring my foundation over so I want to
show you this side how I would usually
apply it and then this side just so you
guys can see the coverage on top of
nothing so it says to let the shades dry
down to see what your true color is
which I'm assuming it means it probably
gets a little bit darker when it dries
I've the shade fair warm and fair
neutral here right here's the shade
neutral and then right here is the shade
fair warm
oh yeah they've definitely darkened all
right so the shades on the top are the
ones that I've dried down after about a
minute and these ones are the ones that
I just watched not too much but maybe
about half a shade so I'm gonna go in
with fair neutral that's just the
undertone I prefer I have a sheet here
that basically explains everything about
this concealer and like 25 times I say
just apply a tiny amount emphasis on
tiny bold that is gently tap tap cap it
into your skin with your finger or
concealer brush or the finger brush blah
blah so I think on one side I'm going to
do my finger and on the other side we'll
try my concealer brush the only brush I
like using for concealer is some more
Fuji 38 I find that it's the only one
that doesn't take away the coverage of
my concealer sometimes I'll go in
afterwards and just smooth it out with a
sponge but when I blend out my concealer
with a sponge 99% of the time it just
takes away a lot of the coverage I guess
let's start out with this side in the
finger I also have hella long nails
right now so it's gonna be fun blending
out it has a slight chemical scent so
let's go in and I'm excited by the way I
have a tiny keloid thing here so just
ignore that tiny amount what is a tiny
amount okay like that subjective we
start out with that and just see how far
it goes so usually when I do concealer I
like you know go all in so let's start
out with that tiny amount and see how it
does over here
anymore that is this story shape this is
fair neutral this looks hella yellow now
I always bring my concealer over my lid
just to cover up any discoloration
freckles ever I have going on up there
it feels very lightweight it feels like
a different concealer I have what does
this feel like okay with my nails I got
to use a brush to kind of blend out this
corner it definitely looks very matte
which might be nice because I am going
to not set one side and just see if
there's a difference between setting it
with a powder and not setting it with a
powder some concealers I can use not set
if they do have this kind of mattifying
finish where they it kind of dries down
to like a powder I have very fine lines
right here where my concealer always
creases that's kind of like unavoidable
because it's basically a wrinkle right
there or something so that's kind of a
given that concealers going to settle in
there might try a different shade is
like a spot concealer afterwards I said
I'm gonna do my like normal how normally
apply my Tarte shape tape because I feel
like I got good coverage here but you
can still see some stuff coming through
so let's just go in like I normally
would here the doe foot applicator feels
a little bit cheap so I'm gonna start
out with the brush and I'll probably
switch this sponge sometimes I'll wait
like a few seconds to let my concealer
just sit there to get the best coverage
but most often I'll just go in I'm not
loving this shade it looked a lot more
peachy you and i swatched it
so coverage wise I feel like I
definitely got better coverage on this
side and that's typically how I would
apply my sealer now that this has been
on for about a minute you can see a
difference in the shade I feel like this
one has already darkened so I really
like how this kind of dries down I
really kind of don't even want to powder
my under eyes because I I just don't
really feel like you need it and I
really like how this side is looking at
all so I'm gonna apply just a little bit
more I know some people is like way
overboard but this is just what works
for me and what I like some people like
to use just like a dab of concealer I'm
just gonna blend it out with a sponge
just I'm gonna see you know do whatever
works for you and whatever you like it
does feel very lightweight so when you
when you do layer it like this it
doesn't feel like it's too heavy or
cakey or anything I'm hoping this
doesn't make my under eyes look super
dry I didn't wash dries really well last
night my eyes felt nice and moisturized
and ready to go this morning before
applying this so it's not my under eyes
aren't super dry or anything right now
beating whether I want to do like a
center forehead highlight kind of
situation and see how it wears that
might as well try not to concealer let's
take fair warm just for the heck of it
and I'm gonna highlight the center of my
face with this okay I'm gonna take
actually the same shade again because it
is drying to be basically the same shape
as my foundation right now maybe a half
a shade lighter I'm taking third neutral
and just go over some of my dark spots
over right here see how does the spot
concealer so a spot concealer I usually
use the same more PG 38 and I'm not
gonna powder my face my whole face today
because powders on accutane well I my
skin is a little bit drier have been
looking for it didn't cover a whole lot
of spot concealer which Tarte shave tape
actually does the same thing for me
toshing tape is a horrible spot
concealer great under the eye is bad to
cover anything alright so sitting nice
on the center of my forehead and it
actually didn't take away up a lot of
the do eNOS I have going on right there
which I like I thought it was gonna kind
of make it super matte like commander
eyes look right now but it's actually
still looking pretty dewy so that's
interesting so I'm gonna get real up
close for a second yes not every brow
hairs plucked most of my eyes are red
from the accutane happen so here's a
very up close so you guys can see I do
feel like it looks better on this side
as far as the creasing but the coverage
looks better on this side I don't think
it's like super opaque coverage I would
definitely say a Tarte shape tape has
more coverage I mean even on those two
layers right there like there's still
stuff coming through looking pretty dry
and crepey right there so I think what
I'm gonna do is leave this side since
that's looking better right now anyways
without the powder and I'm just gonna
kind of try and smooth out these lines a
little bit and then go in and set it as
far as the finish right now it feels
like it's set it doesn't feel like quite
a powder powder finish like if there's
still a little bit of tackiness to it
but it feels like it's not really gonna
budge let's try and set this so for my
setting powders I always use the
Physicians Formula correcting powder the
brush I use for setting my under eyes is
either this elf brush I'll have a link
down below this is like the one I'd be
used for the longest I also like this
Smashbox this is technically their full
coverage foundation brush by just like
this for under my eyes it has a nice
angle to it brushes like this that are
more compact don't take away the
coverage i've weird under eyes have
talked about this before in videos
baking doesn't work for me translucent
powders don't work for me any kind of
flimsy brushes take away the coverage
have like a very specific powder and
brushes that actually work for my
undereyes I'm gonna set this side from
far away I think I like this side better
it's right now it's 11:15 I'm gonna do
the rest of my makeup and it'll be right
back okay so it's now 12 o'clock we're
back on the other camera SOI makeup is
on and highlight and everything blended
out fine on both sides right now I'm
still liking this side better I would
have call this medium coverage I really
don't think it's full coverage this side
I did my full normal kind of coverage I
would do and I can still see freckles
and stuff coming through creasing I
still think it looks a little bit better
on the side without the powder I don't
think my under eyes are really dry right
now I think I just have wrinkles welcome
to your mid-20s right here's last week
wrinkles this week just from far away
like looking at my face I would wear it
again I don't feel like I'm in love with
it at all right now I definitely prefer
the Urban Decay Naked skin over this and
I feel like I actually get better
coverage with this thing on there she is
says that they increase the pigment
level by 73% from this concealer to the
all-nighter concealer so I don't know
I'm not really seeing it light diffusing
pigments blur flaws for a soft focus
effect I don't know man I think it just
looks like a medium coverage matte
concealer it looks pretty good on camera
I do see like the soft effect happening
on camera but in real life I'm not
really seeing it I know we'll see how
this way throughout the day I do like
how it looks on the center of my face so
I'm curious to see how that holds up to
and I don't feel like this has over
emphasized my pores or anything where I
brought it down I'm gonna tell you guys
what's on the rest of my face like I
usually do in foundation Friday I tried
out the the h-has medics it's my rayray
palette shout out to a fellow Seattle
light you did like a contour bronzer
palette but for different skin tones
which she has a deeper skin tone so I
feel like if you're on either end of the
spectrum you're usually aware of that so
I love that she came out with really
light shade for more pale people then
you have a really deep shade and then a
medium one so I just really like that so
I did use this shade and then I also
tried this shade this one is way too
warm for my skin tone it looked very
orange this one reminds me a lot of the
benefit hoola bronzer but better I
actually really liked this as a bronzer
it kind of just looks like when you use
a darker face powder as a bronzer which
works really well for
skin I didn't find it to be to oranjee I
like the tone of it better than the
benefit hoola so as a bronzer I think
this is a nice fair shade blush I use
this you got a summer love I can't put
this thing down lately highlighter I
tried out the Wet n Wild blossom glow
make a glow highlighter I like it I'm
not like obsessed with it right now but
it is very pretty and then for eyes I
can't even tell you what's on my eyes I
use like five thousand different combos
of things use some of the matte shades
actually I think I use like almost all
of the matte brown shade shimmer shades
in here are beautiful I have some of
them on my eyes but then I wanted like a
more cool toned lip since I wanted a
little bit cooler it feels like the
longest was on my face ever since I
wanted a little bit cooler I went on
with the Gigi Hadid cool palette I just
took these two shades right here and
kind of wet them and put them on my lid
and then lipstick I used this I cannot
put this down either the Maybelline Tora
and then I topped it off with my
favorite anyway lip gloss and baby doll
for baby pink baby think and that is
that earrings and everything will be
linked down below so track in time is
1115 that's when I first left you guys
I'm gonna wear at this throughout the
day and see how it holds up the next
track and I do will be in natural
lighting
okay so right now it's 417 so it's been
on for five hours at this point I have
one of my lights right here cuz the Sun
is like already going down in the living
room tried to film another video that
was a total fail that didn't happen just
why it's out here in the living room so
so my eyes have been very Bernie and
watery I think from the accutane
basically right here and right here my
eyeliner and a little bit of the
concealer has like rubbed off you can
see like in the corner yeah looking
great looking great I didn't want to put
on eye drops because I don't want it to
like drip on the concealer and effect
the word test or anything so I'm holding
off on the eye drops for you guys so
again this is the powdered side this is
the not powdered side I would say now
they're creasing about the same I'm
getting a little bit more creasing on
this side than I had earlier so right
now I am liking the powdered side a
little bit better overall yeah it just
kind of looks brighter and everything
under there as far as how its wearing
compared to other concealers I still
like the way Tarte cheap tape looks
better on me but we'll see how it looks
at the end of the night see you guys in
a few hours it is come back 9 o'clock so
it's been on for almost exactly
hours at this point my eyes are so
Bernie I cannot wait to take off my
makeup right now my under eyes have
looked better I mean it's not like
outrageous or anything but I just don't
think they look particularly great I
feel like I have a few more lines than I
did before but I mean for far away
really don't see a whole lot of the
lines and everything I think the thing
that is just bothering about this is
that supposed to be like very full
coverage covers anything tattoo coverage
and it wouldn't even cover like the
little dark spots that I had on my cheek
and also under my eyes
definitely tart shape tape has better
coverage I would just say it's kind of
an average medium coverage concealer I
don't find it to be super super drying
kind of matte but if you have dry under
eyes you probably would want to go with
something more moisturizing if you don't
have dry under eyes I still think the
Tarte shaped tape is better I do like
that I feel like I could go either way
with this one setting them with the
powder or not and on both sides Mandor
eyes right now feel like I have a powder
on what I recommend you buy it for 29
bucks
probably not I was also thinking I'm
pretty sure the Tarte shape tape has a
 ton of product in it yeah you get
0.33 ounces of product and heart-shaped
tape doubled the Urban Decay Naked skin
so even more than twice the amount of
the all nighter heart-shape tape retails
for $27 on altas website but again you
get over double the amount of product so
this concealer for the amount of product
that you get is pretty pricey so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up I need

need to do laundry and pack for Spokane
