my new camera I have a whole new camera
setup going on if you're following my
instagram or twitter or anything i got a
new lens and a ring light and all this
good that I'm super excited about
faces on the computer so I can actually
tell if I'm in focus or not life's good
I did get this mic off of amazon which i
cannot get to work for the life of me
and of course right when i start to film
there's a frickin sledgehammer going on
outside we will get this thing figured
out let me know what you guys think of
the quality and the lighting in the
background and everything i'm debating
whether or not i want to let have things
in the background or just keep it like
this you guys like lights in the
background you want something to look at
in the background like what do you like
tell me let's unbox this thing I didn't
think I said what we're doing today we
have an unboxing of the fab fit fun box
let's do this it's been so long you guys
trying to figure out this new camera
stuff it's not even funny so I hope that
looks better alright so obviously I
haven't looked at this at all by the way
that's it fun i have a whole other video
on it but it's basically a seasonal box
4999 have a coupon code for you guys for
ten dollars off with chilly down below
blast that fit fun box which was the
fall box was amazing he's a good like
three of the products on a daily basis
that I got in that box so I actually
super stoked for this comes with a card
that tells you everything that's on here
I'm not going to read it because I feel
like that's just gonna spoil everything
alright so right on the top is something
zoom but related my ex-roommate like
from college was super into Zumba and I
just don't want to open this and like
give the start I am zooming oh whoa $25
gift card plus free shipping to zumba
where and I totally know this website is
because my
I would always order stuff from it and I
also comes with a some kind of DVD well
kind of stoked about the gift card so
then we have some kind of exclusive
cooking class thing usually get these
like random flyer Club exclusive things
in here that I don't really look at so
I'm center that out but looks like it
three months free of salted some kind of
cooking to be showing thirty dollar gift
card to the fashion project apparently
they have at kate spade rebecca minkoff
and a bunch of other stuff each bird
 each / each purchase goes back
to support charity doesn't say how much
but cool thirty dollar gift card to that
there's a few things in here what are we
doing let's do this first so here's an
eyeshadow kit by swedish beauty where am
i focus here we go by the way if you
have issues focusing your canon camera
actually that's a whole other video feel
your stop mucking okay swedish beauty so
it looks like these are mineral eye
shadows there's two there's a winter
swedish winter white lavender dream to
hold them back here so they're in focus
new lens people so i guessing these are
just yep which look like normal dinner
eyeshadows i'm not going to watch him or
anything if you guys want to see you in
shadow moves let me know yeah to buy
shadows so then we have oh hell yeah
juice beauty this is like a legit good
brand if you don't know juice BTW is
like an organic skincare brand but i
have their face wash and i actually
really like it this is the green apple
peel this is awesome this is a full-size
green apple peel it says it's for
sensitive skin leave it on for 10
minutes and then rinse well then we have
some peanut butter actually almond
butter if you're and almond butter
Justin's is actually like the legit
stuff I think it's like six dollars a
jar then we have some lather ahah hand
cream with evening primrose looks like
this is a hand treatment I might give
this to my aunt or something because I'm
a weird thing with like putting lotion
on my hand
I just wash it off right after let's see
what it smells like yeah there's a seal
it looks pretty frickin thing this
smells really like herbally and spa yeah
smells very spa-like I wonder how much
that retails for the heck is this okay
this normally retails for thirty dollars
hashtag sponsors organic Mel a protein
shake okay so then ooh there's a candle
this is why this box literally weights
like 50 pounds what is this this is the
Daniel stone white tea ginger ooh
coconut bought body candle not sure how
that worked smells good feel like this
is like a kitchen kind of candles and
I'll really fresh yeah actually like
this is normally retails for $42 yeah
not going to read this because as a gift
here we have Tibetan goji berry I serum
with retinol if you saw my December rays
and rejects you know that I have an eye
cream that I'm obsessed with right now
so I probably won't be trying this yet
has a pump let's see what the
consistency is odd don't you hate it
when you forget to take the foundation
off the back your hand super super like
thin feels like a serum this is the
serum son said yeah it's an eye serum
doesn't smell like anything let's see
what this retails for holy sees
that retails for eighty eight dollars
what it stopped recording and I don't
know where I stopped talking we have
this necklace which is pretty awesome
happy knighted gives half the profits to
children in need each of the necklaces
is designed from three recycled bullet
casings and it's supposed to be a symbol
of your bold stance it gets a problem
that 925 million people face every day
like how they worded that this retails
for thirty four dollars but again half
of the profit goes to the kid cause I
think I'm gonna take this chain off and
put this on something else because I
actually really like the necklace
alright so that was everything in my fab
fit fun box we're cleared out I actually
think these boxes are pretty awesome you
know sometimes you just get like one
exceedingly amazing box and then the
next box is just I feel like since
these are seasonal they actually put
time and effort into making them awesome
if you guys like this video and you want
more unboxing videos
is a thumbs up so I know again this is
my first video on this with this setup I
did film a whole new year's look the
other night using it but I just it was
completely out of focus and like the
background was dark and it was just a
disaster so I don't think I'm going to
put that up I did really like the makeup
though which sucks anyone that happens I
don't know when this video will be up
but I do have a few other videos
pre-recorded so you might see one with
like sugar quality after this video it's
not this camera it's just because I
pre-recorded it i did mention this in
the New Year's video but since I'm not
putting it up I'll mention again if I
just want to say a huge thank you to you
guys for all of your support on blog
myths and all of your super nice
comments it was awesome seeing people
that don't usually comment start to like
pop up and say stuff so I really
appreciate that it's just cool seeing
your faces on the pictures and getting
to know you guys you guys are awesome
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye II can't even
reach forward to turn it off anymore
