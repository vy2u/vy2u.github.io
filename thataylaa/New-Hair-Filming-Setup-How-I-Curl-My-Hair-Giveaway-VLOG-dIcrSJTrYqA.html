holder for this thing so it is early
Thursday morning right now it's 7:30
a.m. 7:45 a.m. I have an acupuncture
appointment at 9 o'clock and right now
I'm going to get some Starbucks
desperately need some caffeine in my
life and then I'm also going to go to
the car wash really quick if I have time
whoops I did the drive from Idaho to
Seattle yesterday and my car looks like
a hot mess there's bugs all over the
place I actually cracked majorly cracked
the windshield a rock flew into it and
there's like a five inch crack on it so
that's fun
hey what can I get for you hey can I get
a tall a satay with an extra shot
Oh extra alright anything else
in the chocolate exam please perfect
Adelphia yes alright look at 7:30 for
today thank you thank you
I think I'm literally the first car
going through here this morning so just
had to turn it on
I just drove through here 20 times I'm
just hopefully
relaxing
it's only 8:05 right now this is going a
lot faster than I anticipated I'm always
that person who would rather be like a
half hour early to something then two
minutes late iced what do I even get
tall iced latte with an extra shot I
think that's a triple shot latte but I
never know so I just say that why is
this thing flashing at me all right so
I'm back from the acupuncturist I just
got some PR package things here and an
order from Ulta
so if you're going to show you guys by
fricking there's something going on -
memory card it doesn't recognize the
card in there so I'm using a super small
memory card and I have to import the
footage like every two minutes because
it can't hold video files because it's
like a 16 gig but anyways technology
problems that you probably don't care
about so order something from Nordstrom
hot look there online flash sale site
which I'm obsessed with I'll link it
down below I shop on there like every
day and then I also got something from
Ulta which I don't remember what this is
either so this will be a surprise for
both of us and then there are two PR
packages right here and then attempt to
knock oh yeah totally threw out about
this so I'm on a major contour kick
right now I'm ordering a ton of
contour product to try and find the best
ones for pale skin I'm going to be doing
a whole video on that I got the Too
Faced cocoa contour palette because a
bunch of you guys said the light cocoa
shade in here is amazing well that's
super light this is the light cocoa
shade the medium one looks beautiful I
feel like we'll probably end up mixing
these two it smell so good you smell
like marshmallows to me I think I was in
include these in the upcoming haul but
whatever then I got the elf eyebrow kit
in the shade light can't remember why I
got this I think to actually try to use
the light shade as a contour oh this
might totally work this is the shade I'm
talking about and seriously I think
regardez aren't you running out why
technology why so this is the Catrice
Prime and fine contouring palette and
light shade alright
it just got full again so here's the
Catrice contour shade then I got this
Ulta blush in the shade Sun glow because
it looks like a nice ready kind of shade
I'll probably use as like a bronzer I've
been into kind of use like red tone
bronzers so I'm gonna try this out and
this is on sale for like 4 bucks I think
I order pretty much all of my shoes off
of hablas because they have a ton of
size fours and good kid shoes I love
HotList they put on new stuff every
single day oh these are actually not
shoes these are towels I forgot to
ordered this amazing stuff I haven't
gone new towels since college so I
figured it was time these were like $40
towels that I got for it think 10 bucks
or something oh
Drako alright so Draco sent this package
this looks like I actually have one of
these I have this blue one this is their
new instant temporary color shimmer
spray ordered this blue one on Ulta
because I didn't realize as a shimmer
spray I thought it's just like a color
spray that would be fun but these are
actually all shimmery which I'm not that
into but I guess for Halloween or
something that could be good by the way
the shirt that I'm wearing right now is
actually from the target little boy
section thanks to Malory 17:12
they have such good t-shirts you guys
they're like 6 or 7 bucks and the other
company is NYX ever okay let's open this
with the palette artist palette volume 4
and then they have some Pro sculpting
brow palettes in here I love when brands
include a handwritten card I think
that's like the nicest thing ever
here we go looks like it has a couple
cream gel shades and then I have these
eyebrow powder shades right here
definitely more cool toned the shade
looks like it'll be a nice transition
shade as I dig my nail into it though
I'm debating working out right now or
doing it later filming a first
impression today for foundation Friday
so I kind of always have to plan my day
around that because it has to be a long
enough time length that I have the
foundation on so I'm probably gonna
start filming that as well it's still
the morning
and then keep that on for like eight or
nine hours and then work out maybe
hopefully trying to work out before New
York because slightly out of shape a lot
of you guys have asked me if I still use
my Erin Condren and I do I'm not going
to show you the inside because it has
stuff in here but I use my Erin Condren
every single day I have the new marble
rose gold print I love it and I prefer
the vertical layout I'll show you an
empty page so you can see I have tried
the horizontal layout and I don't know
why but I just really like the vertical
layout better and I like how they have
the marble little inspirational quotes
on the inside now and the dark theme
that's also a new thing it's 10:40 right
now so I'm already running behind
filming wise so I think I'm going to get
everything set up and then film two
videos they'll I've been getting a lot
of questions about how I curl my hair
you guys it's the easiest thing ever all
I do is use a heat protectant first this
is by cohn even know where I got this
kqc thermal shine I don't know smells
really good makes your hair shiny my
favorite hot tools of life are the
bombay hot tools and I just use this one
I think it was like the five yeah 5 min
one it's called so it comes with five
different ends that you can use I just
use this giant one it's like the biggest
one that it comes with just to get those
like wavy kind of whatever curls and I
literally just take pieces and go to
town and wrap away from my face and then
kind of leave the ends out a little bit
so I just leave it and like let it set
there and then once we're all done I'll
come through with my fingers and shape
them a little bit but I literally just
work from the front back and since I am
repairing my hair again I actually have
a method down now that I will share with
you guys once I've repaired it the
second time
but since I've been bleaching and
putting my hair through the wringer I
figured out products that my hair
responds really well to and it gets back
to so my good health pretty fast so
probably gonna be doing a video on that
in like a month or two once my hair is
semi healthy again
but for now I'm not blow-drying my hair
only washing my hair about once or twice
a week so the oil stay in it
hair feels so much softer and so much
better when I just sleep on it at night
instead of blow-drying it and since I
have more like coarse thicker hair my
hair stays curled pretty much I usually
touch-up the front
once in a while but I'm only really
applying heat like once or twice a week
I am really liking this gray color that
I got if you're wondering what's on my
hair and how I got it like this I posted
all about it on Instagram so I'll link
that post down below that explains the
hair situation right now and I think I
am gonna do possibly some tape and
extensions my friend Robbie to Christie
on YouTube
she said she'd help me she does her own
tapings which is freaking baller so I
ordered the hair so she said she'd help
me put them in I'm hoping they come
before New York I actually like short
hair a lot better than I thought I would
when I cut my hair short for the first
time like eight months ago I thought it
was going to be like a temporary thing
and I've kind of just kept it short and
kind of liked it so once is at the top I
do hold a right against my head so it's
all the way up there I think I have a
Bombay discount code so if you're
interested I will leave it down below
and I've used their hot tools for years
now probably like two or three years I
love their Flatiron this flat iron is
the best flat iron on planet Earth
so once I'm done this is pretty much
what it looks like I just like comb
through it with my fingers a little bit
and then I hairspray it if you're like
me and your hair doesn't tease the only
thing that works for me and it kind of
works better now because my hair is so
dry is I hold it like this
and then give it a spritz and then we
have volume and then I just kind of play
with it my hair is actually a lot
shorter right now I just realized before
it went down to like my shoulders in the
front and now it's pretty dang short
filming prep here we go
all right so just finish roaming I did
I'm not gonna tell you about foundations
on because I'm pretty sure this video
will be up the week before that
foundation Friday video is going up yeah
it will be
I think I'm going to upload this on
Sunday or Saturday is like a bonus video
I'm currently filming today foundation
Friday I think I'm also gonna film
September raves and rejects today or I
still do to the drugstore pale nude
lipsticks I have them all in this thing

because swatches Oh swatches I'm going
to film a second video today but first I
need to eat because it's now one o'clock

I've just been editing the last few
hours this one's taking me a long time I
don't know why but this is this coming
foundation Friday's will be coming up
for you guys when you're seeing this and
as I'm sitting here on the couch working
where I usually work I'm kind of
debating moving this situation around
this corner situation and trying to get
maybe like a corner desk and actually
put a chair out here so I have like a
desk to work on I could work on our
kitchen table but those chairs are so
damn uncomfortable and it hurts my neck
and my back when I do that I don't know
I feel like if I rearrange this I could
kind of make this little corner into
like a home office and then maybe move
that cube against that wall or something
okay couple new packages just came
colour-pop fall collection when she'll
show you guys and then I'm super excited
because my VP fashion tape in extensions
I was talking about did I talk about
that in this video I can't remember but
Kristy is gonna help me put these bad
boys in we actually just figured it out
I'm going to go over there before New
York and I'm gonna dye these myself here
like edge of the other exemptions
these are tape ins not clip ins and
Christie puts in her own and she cuts
them so I'm freaking excited I'm gonna
dye these using first purple shampoo and
then add a little bit more gray to match
my hair so I'm probably gonna film that
process but I don't know if I want to do
this tonight I kind of feel like it
whenever I get this stuff I feel like I
have to do it like right now and then
color pops Fall collection came this
work in like ionia note this is this
mine feels like a bookshelf or something
and they're all in these separate things
super pretty packaging so we got some
ultra satin lips
it's funny how they're not even really
doing the oh no they are ultra matte
lips and ultra satin and then three
eyeshadow one I'm on the camera ooh this
could be a good highlight folks this is
the shade Paisley yeah I'm definitely
gonna try this as a highlight oh this
one has a blush oh this shade is
speaking to me it's like a rust Brown
shape more of the ultra matte lips these
are like red
awesome good thing colour-pop shadow is
never for him break literally all those
are totally fine then we have a purple
and we have some matte purples
colour-pop lippie stick oh this looks
super pretty blue in here
look at that color that looks beautiful
this is in shade notion this is what
these ones look like I'm still over
there editing at my little makeshift
desks now what time is it six 13 right
now and I just post maids Taco Bell no
shame I've been addicted to the cheesy
gordita supreme I think that's what no
is a Crunchwrap supreme but I get beans
instead of me so it's vegetarian I'm not
the healthiest person in the world if
you can tell so bum why does my face
look legit orange right now I have a lot
of filming energy right now I think
because I feel good and I've been gone
for so long like an Idaho that it just
feels good to get back into it I was
going to film two videos today I'm still
filming the first impression obviously I
think I'm gonna do the extensions
because I kind of want to just get those
done and then this weekend I'm going to
have to film I think we're gonna do the
exceptions
fill in the first step which was just
toning them and it got it to like the
silvery color and then I'm going to add
the gray color on tomorrow oh man
leopard robe with the turtleneck and a
face mask whole new look so it's like 9
p.m. now just wrapped up the video my
last check-in have on a no lie Henriksen
I think it's the vitamin C or black
sugar scrub mask I don't know it's like
a little sample thing so I'm just gonna
finish off some editing probably watch
some Gossip Girl because I've been way
too into that lately and call it a night
