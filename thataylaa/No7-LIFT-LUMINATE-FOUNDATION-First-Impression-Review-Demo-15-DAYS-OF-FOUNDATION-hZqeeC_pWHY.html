right now and it is 10:00 in the morning
all right so today it is day 10 of 15
days of foundation I actually can't
believe a state 10 this is flying by
this time but it is day 10 so this is
where I try out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days today we're
trying out a drugstore foundation this
is the number 7
lift and luminate foundation can find
number 7 at Target and Walgreens this
foundation used to be on Ulta but they
already took it off I checked this
morning Ulta launches a ton of
products and brands but they also
quickly take them off I've noticed if
they're not selling so I ordered this on
Walgreens and it was actually buy two
get one free Walgreens sometimes have
some good makeup deals it retails for
$15.99 and you get one fluid ounce of
product the description for this product
is very brief it just says for normal to
very dry skin types
I've dry skin right now SPF 15 fine
lines appear reduced it's supposed to
lift firm and brighten your skin
what-oh disguising lines and wrinkles
definitely thought it said disgusting
lines and wrinkles about to flush it as
well as evening out the skin tone to
give a flawless look supposed to give
you a youthful glow and it has medium
coverage this comes in 9 shades on the
Walgreens website I remember when I was
ordering this I was having a really
tricky time figuring out what the
lightest shade of this was I ended up
going with the shade cool vanilla
there's also a warm ivory I think I went
with cool vanilla because it looked much
more neutral I'm gonna search swatches
right here so you can see how the shade
cool vanilla compares to some of the
other foundations I own so right here's
the number 7 lift and luminate
foundation in the shade cool vanilla
next over is the flower beauty light
illusion in the shade L 1 the lightest
shade I just did a video on this
foundation Co IO lifeproof and 101 derma
called 2:08 NARS radiant foundation and
Mont Blanc and Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless in 110 so if you're

down below I know I'm a broken record
hearing this every day at this point but
there are new people in every video
we're trying to do this thing you know
all right let's talk foundation if you
want to know my thoughts on the number
seven lift and luminate foundation and
how to apply somewhere throughout the
day you're in the right place just keep
watching all right I had to take a pill
this morning that makes me totally
drowsy so I'm feeling a little bit loopy
right now but we are gonna do this thing
so what day is it is it day ten
so I've washed moisturize and prepped my
skin already oh pretty thick that thing
is not moving I'm gonna start out with a
brush on this side of my face this is
the elf fall to my blending brush this
is one of my favorite foundation brushes
and then on the other side my la girl
sponge I think we're ready right oh it
has kind of like a almost like a fruity
scent is that scent whoo it does say
specifically that this is for normal to
very dry skin and so far I can see why
it's very glowy but doesn't seem to be
clinging anywhere yet the shade is about
a shade too dark but the undertone is
right so it doesn't look too off I think
this one that I could lighten up my face
with concealer and kind of make it work
I have freshly washed hair today you
know when you wash your hair and do all
the styling and all that and you feel
like a new woman okay looking really
nice at least from far away looking like
up close yeah so far what the brush is
looking really nice feels very gel like
so let's try a sponge and I actually
didn't use that much product Wow
that just literally did nothing with
this bunch try some more all right much
lighter coverage with the sponge with
the sponge I'm getting light coverage it
seems to be likes majorly soaking this
one up or something
okay so this one I would definitely use
a brush with but let me do this side
okay a hundred percent when to use a
brush with this one I'm gonna go over
this there we go
I do agree with the medium coverage
claim with a brush and I like that using
this one with a brush isn't making my
skin look more textured or anything it's
still sitting nice on my skin it feels
very lightweight and comfortable but it
does feel like a gel foundation it has a
lot of tackiness to it but it feels like
it's kind of setting down doesn't feel
like one that's gonna slide I kind of
want to build this up a little bit so
I'm gonna go in with just a really tiny
amount on my brush and I'm not gonna put
this everywhere just where I want a
little bit more coverage that looks nice
it's not building to full coverage but I
am getting high medium coverage now yeah
I actually kind of like the shade it's
giving me a little bit more like life to
my skin just because of the shade but
it's not orangie I'm gonna try just
smoothing out my forehead a little bit
and I have a tiny bit more on here with
the sponge yeah almost like mattify is
Ammar with this button for some reason
my forehead looks really nice it's not
cleaning anywhere the rest of my skin
looks really good too there's a little
bit of creasing like in my nose area
whenever I have a foundation that does
that I just take this brush with a
little bit of product this is the morphe
G 38 I don't know why still to look at
this every single time he's this brush
every day of my life probably know what
it is but I just kind of blend it into
the crease of my nose a little bit more
and there we go I like that it looks
like I have healthy glowy makeup on but
you can still see my skin I can see a
few freckles coming through my forehead
I still can see a little bit scarring
and staff so no complaints are now on
this one so right now is 855 I really
wanted to do a intense kind of eye look
I feel like in the last few days of
videos I've been doing
like no makeup so we're gonna go all out
today so I'm gonna do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back okay so
now it's oh it's almost exactly 10 a.m.
check-in time is 9 o'clock though cuz
that's actually when I finished up with
my face makeup
I took forever on my eyes got a little
sidetracked doing a shadow listing the
podcast lawnmower is now outside hope
you can't hear that I powder just my
cheek area with the laura geller balance
and brighten powder I don't love the way
it's sitting on my forehead I just got a
clip in natural lighting and it almost
looks not patchy it just looks a little
bit uneven or something I'm debating
powdering my forehead and I think I'm
going to because I don't think I would
wear this on its own and it it looks
like it needs something to kind of just
smooth it out though I think I'm gonna
use a little bit of the Laura Geller I'm
just gonna press this lightly right on
the center I don't want to use my big
powder brush because I don't know why I
don't want to mess up my eyebrows
basically oh man this guy's really going
to town right now that looks better
I need a setting spray with this one if
I wasn't doing a review right now I
would definitely spray a ton of
setting spray
but it doesn't look bad it's not
creasing anywhere so I'm sure you guys
what this looks like in natural lighting
now that I have the powder over top of
my forehead and then we'll do a flash
test so here it is right after I just
powdered my forehead it still has kind
of a satin Sheen coming through and that
powder is a little bit glowy you can
kind of just see a product like sitting
on top but it doesn't look bad here's
the rest of my face let's do a flash
test keep in mind this one does have SPF
15 and I am wearing a little powder over
top it doesn't look bad like it doesn't
look like there's really a flash back my
under eyes do for sure
so makeup on the rest of my face I kind
of just ran with the whole red thing
clearly I tried out this Sedona lace
palette which I haven't used a Sedona
lace palette in years and this is
actually a new palette by them I think
and this one has super pretty colors
like super bright fun colors then you
have these five glitters down here I
went in with basically this whole area
of red mattes red orange yellow mattes
and they are so frickin pigmented but
they blend it out I really liked the
formula these super
pigmented I didn't try any of the
shimmers so I can't speak to those but
all of the ones in this area were great
I love the kind of peachy like I'm
almost melon shade right here these ones
I kind of press my finger into the red
glitter and they're not glitter shadows
they're basically like pressed glitters
so you wouldn't need to use a glitter
primer or eyelash glue or something
something to make the glitter stick to
your lids for sure cuz they're just
pressed glitter basically but I'm
definitely gonna keep trying this
because every shade I used I was
impressed by for the gold glitter on my
inner corner I used the heavy metal
liner by Urban Decay this is in the
shade Midnight Cowboy cowboy or cowboy
not a cowgirl lashes I use dial or 1:21
bronzer I used this yesterday because I
didn't I wasn't filming yesterday I
tried out this bear Pro powder
foundation by bare minerals in the shade
sateen 0-5 and this is obviously
supposed to be a powder foundation but
this shade for fair skin is a super
pretty very natural bronzer if you just
want a little bit of color doesn't look
too warm it doesn't look too grey
actually has a really pretty color to it
for bronzer if you around my skintone
then after I did the rest of my makeup I
felt like I needed a little bit
something else so then I went back in
with the Tarte don't be afraid to dazzle
this shade I just use a tiny bit of this
just to add a little bit more color
because the rest of my makeup was very
intense for blush is the narcissist
palette it's called Wantage and I went
oh god that's hard open I went in with
this blush shade and then actually for a
highlight I used this I was gonna use it
as a blush top perks I thought it was
gonna be way too dark but it shows up
way lighter on the face and it does in
the pan it's like a light pink shade on
your face and then for lips I use
smashbox always on and out loud and then
I topped it off with the new Urban Decay
high shine glosses this packaging is the
most beautiful lip gloss packaging I
think I've ever seen it's so visually
satisfying to me this is in the shade oh
that's weird this is midnight cowgirl
this is just a very kind of low pigment
nude gloss I love how these feel they
have a little bit of like cooling to
them and they smell very minty exactly
like peppermint like peppermint
essential oil doesn't feel too sticky
and I think that is everything on my
face right now all right I've already
peeled off my lashes lasted about two
hours with them on today but right now
it's 142 so it's been on for almost five
hours so also clearly wiped off my
lipstick I have an Amazon Prime now
ordered thing coming so like trying to
tone down make up a little bit looks a
little bit heavy you could just be with
the powder on top it doesn't necessarily
look dry I just look a little bit heavy
in certain areas I mean my forehead
looks pretty much the same it almost
looks like a little bit spotty err to me
I don't love how it's looking right
there keeps getting too bright can you
darken there we go
getting a little bit of creasing not bad
doesn't look bad down this area actually
like how it looks a little bit better on
the bottom half of my face then on my
forehead I really don't like how it
looks on my forehead this one needs help
like something needs to happen with this
and I'm trying to figure out okay what
that help would be I really liked how it
first went on so again could be the
powder over top on this one I'm gonna
try it different ways for the wrap-up
video and let you guys know how that
goes but we'll see how it where to start
the day if it gets any better we'll see
you guys at the end of the night all
right I'm looking a little rough right
now what time is it right now it's 656
I'm going to try and make it out of my
house today before the Sun Goes Down I'm
gonna go and walk right now so I'm gonna
wrap this up but it's been on for 10
hours and with this powder combo I don't
like it I think it just looks so makeup
II and just kind of gross like what it's
happening on my forehead and down here
now it's just breaking up I do feel like
this is gonna be one that I can make
work with something so I'm excited to
play around with this one because I did
like how it looked when I first went on
there's just something I needed to work
with with it let me know down below if
you tried this one what do you use a wet
to use it alone do you set it I'm like
close to liking this one and I want to
like this one but it's not quite there
