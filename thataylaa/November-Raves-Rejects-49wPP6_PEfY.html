rejects I never post in October raves
and rejects but I did post my five
favorite products on my website so link
that down below if you missed that got
the peppermint mocha extra shot ready to
go I cannot believe it's almost are you
December I haven't even been to target
yet and scoped out the holiday section
I'm slacking it did just feel my shadow
and schmooze on the lip I'm wearing
right now so if you want to see that I
believe it'll be up before this video
I'll put it in the down bar if it is but
today we are going to be talking about
my favorite products of the last
basically two months there's a lot of
 in here so let's get into it the
first thing I have to mention if you
follow me on instagram you've already
seen me rave about this so this is the
cosmetics bye bye pores pressed powder
they make a loose powder version as well
but this is just the translucent pressed
powder version and I like this so much
better than the lace patternn version
this is freaking amazing at setting your
makeup this is by far my favorite
setting powder I've ever used it makes
you literally look flawless first of all
the finish doesn't look powdery it just
looks like literally it does look
poreless I was having issues with this
foundation not staying throughout the
day this is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation in the shade snow which is
also a favorite this month these two
together are like my new favorite combo
this needs a good powder to set it at
least on my skin
this con will last literally all day for
me I put on my makeup at about 7:00 in
the morning for work and I don't take
off my makeup till about 9:00 p.m. at
night so favorite foundations this month
I have two the first is the one I just
mentioned and the second is a Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD stick I have a whole
review I'm not gonna go too in depth the
shade snow is a little bit yellow on my
skintone I feel like but for some reason
I feel like it works and it's light
enough the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick foundation I was so not expecting
to like this I haven't had great success
with stick foundations in the past
they're usually like a little bit
difficult to blend out or just don't
have the best coverage this is holy crap
you guys first of all this is completely
full coverage you can build it up to
full coverage when you first put it on
just with a thin layer it's a good I
would say like a heavy medium to full
coverage I would recommend using a
mattifying primer underneath this
it can look super dewy and get oily
throughout the day feels like you're
blending nothing when you blend out on
your face I also did a first impression
review on this and I've been switching
off between these two foundations every
single day since I got them both yeah
speaking of mattifying primers my
favorite mattifying primer has been the
Make Up For Ever step one skin equalizer
they make four different ones I've been
testing out all of them but this is my
favorite so far this is the mattifying
version it feels like kind of strange
when you put on your face it gets like
really tight kind of feels like you had
Botox but this legit
works I feel like it's really difficult
to tell with primers whether or not is
actually working I like to step-by-step
introduce new products in so like after
I had these two down then I brought in
this primer and this is what makes the
whole the whole routine if you have oily
skin try this stuff out right now with
the seasons changing and everything I
feel like I have combo skin I usually
have a pretty normal skin but my skin
has been getting a little bit there a
little bit oily throughout the day and
this just does the freaking job I
believe you can get this in travel size
so if you don't want to pay the full
price if you just want to test it out
get the travel size from Sephora
everything in here I'm like so excited
to talk about that I don't even know
where to start well we're on the
foundations this sponge this is not a
Beauty Blender if you see it has a
slanted side here kind of like the Real
Techniques sponge this is actually from
the dual ended okay we got it and the
battery's dying great this comes with
the pure cameo contour stick and I'm not
a fan of this and that will be mentioned
later but this sponge holy crap this is
seriously worth it to me to buy this
stick because this is better than the
beauty blender in my opinion it does not
soak up as much foundation when you wet
it it just feels different like you
don't have to squeeze as much water it
just applies it better it has this point
right here so it's easy to get under
your eyes if you're pressing in
concealer I really like using this flat
side to apply my foundation I'm not sure
if they sell this by itself I'll do some
research when I'm editing this and I'll
put it in the description box next my
new favorite face wash of light love my
Neutrogena acne stress notes not acne
stress it's the one I always mentioned
in the like silver tube that has
exfoliating beads in it
I wanted to get something that was just
a cleanser that didn't have any kind of
exfoliating in it it's the bee or a
blemish fighting ice cleanser and I love
products where you can feel it like
tingling or it feels like icy and you
rub it into your face it totally has
this bullying sensation it has 2%
salicylic acid in it my skin reacted to
this really well I've been using this
for about him I want to say a month and
a half now I've been testing out a ton
of new face products and my skin has
been breaking out lately but I love this
stuff I use it every single day I use it
in the morning and then I use my
exfoliator at night usually I've just
been like in the stuff are we good now
yeah yeah we're battery just died again
but we are back that don't remember what
we ended up with my new favorite bronzer
is the body shop honey bronze this is in
the shade 0-1 this is perfect if you
have pale skin if you don't have pale
skin get the shade up because it blends
out so
if you don't have pale skin get the
shade up from this because it just
blends out so easily I'm wearing it
right now you'll see how it applies in
this tutorial on this look
shout out to Holly eats lipstick I love
Holly if you're not subscribed to a
channel already you need to be a link it
down below
she's used this for a while and I
finally decided to pick it up and I'm so
glad I did because it is frickin
amazeballs so two hair products that I'm
in love with I also have other hair
products that I mentioned on the blog
post so you can check that out if you're
interested but and this is the Tri Chi
tri theidea G tea tree oil line and when
I was in Sacramento my cousin has her
like beauty license so we went to Cosmo
Prof and I have never been to Cosmo Prof
before it is like Disneyland if you're
into beauty and hair stuff so this came
in a kit like a holiday set with a
little serum thing that I haven't
actually tried yet but I think it was
like 15 dollars for all three products
which is insane for this brand this is
the blow dry primer lotion and then this
is a hair mask so this one used
obviously in the shower just as a normal
hair mask I apply it from about here
down it smells heavenly I love the smell
of tea tree this is actually a thinner
mask than I'm used to it's kind of runny
like it's not as thick as the macadamia
one or other hair mask I've tried this
one smells the same but this is actually
a kind of like lotion thing that you put
in when your hair is damp before you
blow-dry it this makes my hair so soft
it's so much more tamed than my hair
usually is after I blow-dry it I could
go out of the house after I blow-dry my
hair when I use this stuff normally I
can't normally I'm still like lion
status loving this this over cosmetics
you glow girl highlight this is a
collaboration with Duke that the
Instagram account so beautiful I
mentioned this on Instagram this is the
pinkier shade obviously so frickin
beautiful there it is just gives you the
prettiest blow it doesn't look trockie
at all it just gives your face the most
beautiful highlight and if you use the
code Kathleen 4d you can get 40% off of
your whole Oprah order another highlight
I wanted to quickly mention is
colour-pop fanny pack this is one of
their super shock cheek highlights so it
is a cream highlight a closer
about this on Instagram - you're not
following me on Instagram you should be
it's the same as my YouTube Nick this is
a cream highlight but it is white so if
you have camel skin you are going to
love this it is beautiful it's like a so
silvery white highlight also looks great
on the inner corner or on your Cupid's
bow I think this is limited edition so
if you're curious you should probably
pick it up now wanted to mention these
Jakob Beauty triple baked eyeshadows
these are so frickin pretty I'm wearing
one of them on my lid right now like
under this crazy amount of glitter but
my favorite three trios are Baked Alaska
which is this cool toned greyish topi
one dulce de leche which I'm pretty sure
I'm going to include this in my
drugstore wedding tutorial which I am
going to be doing this trio which is
cherry fudge sundae I have swatches on
Instagram
I think these retail for like $6 you can
get them at Ulta online the Ulta in
Seattle is super shitty so they never
have this kind of stuff in store but you
might be able to find it in store as
well these are great battery is dying
again so we're gonna get through this
right now these are the aisle or and
number 126 look at these bad boys when
you put these on they look like you have
mink lashes on they're so full no words
I definitely want to try more lashes
from aisle or $7 or whatever these are
they're like under $10
these look way higher and lashes and
they actually are also wore these in my
healthy lifestyle video this is now the
fifth time that the battery has died I'm
about to check this camera out of the
window I'm determined to get done right
now the last rave that I want to mention
this month is the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette I don't know why I
resisted for so long
buying this I just felt like I didn't
need another matte eyeshadow palette but
I'm telling you there's something about
this the shades are just so easy to
blend out there's warm tones there's
cool tones in here I use a mix of these
two every single day in my crease that's
all I were to work with some mascara
even though these are all neutral mattes
I feel like there's a ton of different
looks that you can do with this in my
opinion if you don't have a good matte
eyeshadow palette this is the one that
you need the battery's going again
super happy I got this
loving it my only reject this month is
the pure they change to pur cosmetics I
keep wanting to call them pure pure
minerals this is the imperial cause
Kamio contour this just didn't work for
me it wasn't absolutely horrible it's
just after using the makeup forever
stick this is just like didn't cut it
doesn't blend out well it doesn't have
very good coverage for being the light
shade the contour shade is like way too
dark for my skin tone this shade is
actually light enough which is
surprising it's just not I just would
never use this as an all-over kind of
foundation it says it's a contour
foundation so it is supposed to be a
foundation not just like a highlight
under your eye forehead kind of
situation wouldn't recommend this but I
do really like the sponge that comes
with this that was everything I hope you
guys like this video if you do give it a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching see you in my next video
