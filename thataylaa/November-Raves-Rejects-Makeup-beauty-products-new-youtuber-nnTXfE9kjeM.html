networks marketing scheme you alright so
today we have November race and rejects
December is officially here because
there's literally a snowstorm going on
right now
Seattle November was a good month I feel
like I tried a lot of random things and
I have some stuff that I really like and
I'm really excited to share with you
guys we can ignore the lines main head
of hair right now this is just what
happens and let's just jump into it
do you like I had some kind of important
news to tell you that I cannot remember
now I'm gonna start off with one the
more random favorites of the month this
is a hair wax this is the parisa hot wax
strip free wax that had gone off of
Amazon I'm Jewish I got a lot of hair
going on in places where it doesn't need
to be I've kind of gone on a mission to
find good hair removal products I really
can't bring myself to go get my eyebrows
waxed in a salon because I just feel
like it's something that I can do and
it's waste of 20 bucks so I decided to
order this way for all these like
Persian women commenting saying that it
did great things for their thick hair so
sign me up you can use this on your face
brows or bikini so basically it comes in
this little pan thing which I have in a
plastic bag because I've already used
and you're supposed to place this on the
stovetop I apparently didn't have my
brain turned on the day I first used it
and put it in the microwave which was a
really bad idea
oh my proudest moment I've definitely
recommend putting this on the stovetop
and it just heats up you let half of it
heat up all the way and melt and then
you just mix in the other half and it
gets to this like sticky honey
consistency and you just put it on with
a little stick that it gives you and
then the cool thing about this is that
there's no strips involved you literally
just peel off the wax itself and it
takes everything off this is not like a
pain for you kind of wax removal like
this thing bucket hurts but it's totally
worth it in my opinion because it
literally leaves you like hair free it
also thinks is a super reasonably is
around 10 to 13 dollars this will last
me like a lifetime this is
 ton of wax the next favorite is
kind of random I have been on a like
serious winter cleaning thing it's not a
thing I feel like I've had the need to
like get rid of all of the clothes that
have literally just been sitting in my
dresser for five months and giving a lot
to Goodwill but then the things that I
feel like I could sell I'm trying to
sell so to do that I've been using the
app called Poshmark Poshmark is free to
use if you have an iphone or android you
can buy and sell used clothes on there
which is blessing and a curse because it
just makes me want to buy everything I
have been limiting myself to selling
clothes on there I feel like part of my
thing with selling clothes is that I
just don't want to like deal with it I
literally will just put the shirt on my
hardwood floor like on a good background
take a picture and then you type in like
a description and you literally list the
item in like 30 seconds super easy to
use it's just a good way to get rid of
stuff but also make some cash you know
I'm saying it's kind of addicting so
beware next favorite I mention is the
Jimmy Choo stars perfume look at this
bottle I feel like I could just stare at
this thing all day like look at this it
has a rose gold bottle it smells
heavenly I smelled this in Sephora or
know an old a'right when it came out and
I guess this is limited edition I want
this off of Nordstrom's calm it is
pricey I think this was like 98 dollars
but this is one of those perfumes to me
that I feel like I'm gonna love in like
ears I feel like it's one of those
perfumes it like once you wear it for a
couple hours it actually smells better
and this stays on literally all day I
can smell it on my clothes like all my
jackets days after I first braid it
heaven alright next favorite of the
month is the Sedona lace EB 13 blending
brush when I first tried this thing I
don't know just like this shape doesn't
really appeal to me I don't know what it
is about this brush but I feel like if
you're gonna have two brushes in your
collection you need this and the e bo9
brush these are like my lifesaver I
literally feel like you could use these
two brushes in your finger and you can
do an entire eye look it's actually what
I use today on my eyes I do have a
shadow
coming up on this look by the way I
don't know which one will be at first
but I'm guessing this video will be at
first anyways back to the brushes they
do a lot of 20% off sales info my
twitter i usually post when they have
sales and stuff really reasonable and
really great quality this is probably
one of my like holy grail products i've
mentioned this months ago and it's just
one of those products that just kind of
like resurfaced on then love with all
over again this is the form of whoa what
is this the physician's formula warm
nude shimmer brick thing this can be
used on your eyes or your face i
honestly think this would be great on
any skin tone for fair skin especially
it's great because you have these light
shades you can use for bronzer you have
this little shimmery white shade i have
it on my inner corner today you can also
use it on your cheekbones as a highlight
there are just so many different things
that you can do with this little brick
it's perfect this is like $12 at the
drugstore Rite Aid and CVS and Walgreens
they usually all just rotate out their
brands so I would wait until you can
find this forty percent off because it's
gonna eventually happen I actually have
an abnormal amount of hair products in
this video hair is not my thing
hair and I do not get along I hate hair
if I could hire someone to just do my
hair every morning I would this was
total chance I feel like that I found
this product the first month I was here
I got my hair cut I just yelled like a
cheap place and the ladies were awesome
I'll leave the place down below if
you're in the Seattle area don't
remember it often often don't remember
it off the top of my head they use this
product when they straighten my hair and
my hair was like I did not know that
this lion's mane could like get that
straight and thin this is the bio silk
shine on spray this is a finishing spray
it's not a hair spray trolls frizz and
provides a UV protection and shine if
you have thick hair or issues with your
hair getting frizzy definitely try to
stuff out you need a little bit if you
spray too much your hair can look a
little bit oily just because it does
make your hair look like super freakin
shiny I cannot say enough good things
about this no I wasn't sent this or and
saying I just genuinely think this
product is amazing next is the Chi 44
iron guard like I said I have a weird
amount of hair products I don't know why
this stuff came in the box was that
fabfitfun box I want to say I think it
came in that box this is the full size
product I was kinda surprised that this
came in there because like what I have
kind of like a love-hate relationship
with heat guards for your hair because I
just like how do you know that they're
doing anything is one of those products
I feel like might just be like a total
marketing scheme that word but if you're
gonna use one this one smells heavenly
it smells like the hair salon if you
need a heat protectant in your life I
would check out this just for the smell
like come on do you spray it in my hair
whenever it's damp before I blow-dry it
or whatever I'm doing that day all right
this is the final hair product I'm
mentioning I swear I got this stuff off
of hot look it was like half off this is
the macadamia reviving curl cream I
don't think this really helps make your
hair curly but I do really like about
this is that it really helps to tame the
frizz I should be wearing it in my hair
right now but I'm not I'll just put a
couple pumps of this stuff in my hair I
usually start like right here and go
down you don't want to put it on your
roots because it does have macadamia oil
in it again if you have thick hair or
need something to control the frizzy
I've going on try this stuff out I do
really like this and it smells heavenly
the next product is the Lime Crime Venus
palette like how could this not be a
favorite this month these are just
absolutely beautiful I'll swatch some of
them for you look at how crazy pigmented
those are creation in this palette
reminds me exactly a matte Brown script
I love these like warm neutral matte
tones in here the only one I'm not
really a fan of is rebirth just because
I feel like I wouldn't wear it enough
for it to be like in this palette I wish
I put in like a matte white or cream
shade or something you do have this
shade in here but this is like a pearl
tone this is beautiful divine which is
where is it divine right here is perfect
for in the crease it's what I'm wearing
right now
I really hope Lime Crime comes out with
other palettes because the packaging and
everything on this
just on point my next favorite of the
month is my Erin Condren planner I have
a whole video on this thing unboxing it
I think it'll be up after this video who
really knows I've been kind of crazy
into like planner decorating there's
this whole world out there you guys that
I had no idea existed people get like
crazy into decorating their planners
I'll show you guys like a sneak peek but
I did film a decorate my planner with me
video this is December so far I just
think they're so fun to decorate you
totally don't need to be doing this but
for me it's just like a good creative
outlet I really like decorating this
thing and it's just like enjoyable for
me Erin Condren is pretty pricey
I think these retails for $55 or $50 the
cool thing is that you can totally
customize it for what you like and they
are really great quality like these are
all laminated all the paper in here is
laminated on the spiral so it's not
gonna like tear out so I don't have any
rejects of the month I do have a
favorite youtuber that I wanted to
mention I do want to start doing this
every month because I just feel like
it's a nice way to share the love and
introduce each other to new youtubers
that's why these need to support each
other you know what I'm saying
youtuber that I want to mention this
month is Maria Cahill Cahill I'm not
sure how to say her last name I'll leave
her channel of course down below and
I'll put her picture right here I super
e supreme I super randomly came across
her channel I think I was looking up
some foundation I don't even know came
across her channel and I just kind of
got hooked she is totally herself on her
channel she's funny she's goofy she's
just starting out on YouTube so I would
definitely recommend you guys check her
out he's just someone that if she sticks
with it she is gonna go really far and
I'm really excited to see where her
channel takes her check her out the end
