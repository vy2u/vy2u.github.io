important part cramming your eyes using
NYX jumbo eye pencil in the color milk
and I'm just going to blend that in with
my fingers and smear it all out over my
lid this is going to help you I shadows
stay on all day without creasing and
just going to give you a nice base for
your shadows
we're also going to run that down to the
lower lashline pallid i'm going to be
using for my eyeshadows is the next but
naked eyes I don't know why there's so
many damn naked palettes where's the
fully clothed palette I don't see that
we're going to take this tan shade with
a Sigma e-40 blending brush and just put
that all over the crease this is just
going to give your eye a little bit more
definition
then we're going to take a matte cream
colored and just place that all over the
lid with our finger I find that when you
use your finger it gives way better
pigmentation so I hope you can hear my
computer in the background sounds like
it's going to explode
just keep patting that thing on then
using an elf crease brush we're going to
take this dark taupe color and just
apply that to the outer V you want to
focus most of that on the very outer
area of your eye and then slightly
you're just like stuttered slightly
blend that inward as you can see I'm
doing here
then I'm going to go back in with the
Sigma e-40 blending brush and just blend
all of that out you want to make sure
there's no product on your brush then
going back in one last time with that
cream color you're going to use your
finger again and just Pat over that this
is going to make the white stand out and
look more vibrant then I'm going to take
the next jumbo eye pencil in milk again
and apply that to the inner tear duct
and then bring it down a little bit when
you apply this to your tear duct it just
makes your eyes look way more open and
we're going to put a shimmery white
color right here over the top of it if
you have NYX jumbo eye pencil in cottage
cheese you could use that instead and
that's kind of like white and shimmery
all in one I'm laying on my bed right
now recording this and I have the hugest
double chin ever I'm so proud god my
videos are so unprofessional let me know
if you guys like talking tutorials
better or just the ones where there's
music playing now I'm applying that
jumbo eye pencil to my waterline and
then I'm taking NYX liquid eyeliner
which is my all-time favorite liquid
eyeliner and I'm going to make a wing
die here I might do a whole other
tutorial showing you how i do my winged
eye but you can kind of see the steps
I really like this eyeliner because it's
super dark and also has a really fine
tip so it's easy to make that point and
it's like around three dollars at the
drugstore so super inexpensive and
really good feel like this is taking me
like a century to do this so I'm just
going to keep rambling alright so
eventually once i'm done with this I'm
going to use my two favorite mascaras
and apply the l'oreal voluminous to my
top lashes and then the revlon mascara
as a second coat on my top lashes and on
my bottom lashes this is my favorite
mascara combo it just makes your
eyelashes look really big and long and i
love it
I'm going to take this L'Oreal lipstick
in violet chiffon I love these lipsticks
they're super buttery and moisturizing
and this is just a fun purple color
obviously so this is the final look if
you guys liked it click the thumbs up
button and I'll see you guys in the next
