all right so today we are finally doing
an office tour blogging with the canon
70d is an arm workout there we go look
at that so for those of you who don't
know I moved into this office space a
couple months ago now still not totally
done there's still a few things that
need to be added and changed and stuff
but the most part everything is in its
decorated I do YouTube as a job and I
also do freelance digital marketing
consulting I have a video where I go
more in depth about how I ended up here
and what I actually do and all that we
want to do that shadow schmooze video I
will link it and I over here and also
down below I'm not going to go super
in-depth about it here but basically I
needed a space or one this base where I
didn't have to be crammed in my bedroom
for filming and working and everything
the only equipment takes up a ton
of space and since I've been doing
YouTube I've never had a dedicated
filming space the last two years that
I've been in the apartment that we're
currently in I've been filming in my
bedroom literally on top of my bed
pretty much that's one of the main
reasons I wanted to get an office space
now I'm not sure how much longer I'm
actually going to be keeping this office
space for multiple reasons construction
has been a huge issue I know you guys
say you can't hear it but that's because
it takes me three hours or four hours to
film a video because that stuff every 10
minutes not going to go into all the
reasons but basically to be determined
how long I'm actually staying in here
which is why I've been filming all my
recent videos back in my bedroom but I
figured well it is here and I'll show
you guys it I love decorating I love
buying home stuff moving into a new
space is always really fun for me so if
you guys want to see my room tour video
I also have one on that so if you guys
are excited to see this video make sure
you give it a thumbs up all the stuff
I'm going to be talking about where it's
from details is going to be down below
in the description box why I'm going out
of breath right now and yeah it's just
going to be a chill blog Styles office
door so if you want to see my office
you're in that place just keep watching
straddling the floor right now my legs
okay so here's the door when you come in
and then here is a little bit of an
overview and then I'm going to go into
each little area so this is actually a
really huge space there's tons of room
in here okay let's start in this area
little stainless steel wrapping is
actually a kitchen utility rack I
believe it's called from Amazon every
single thing I'm talking about that I
can find will be linked down below in
the description box in order that I'm
talking about them I really like the
look of kind of industrial so I love
these racks they actually hold the bins
really well there's tons of space on
here this thing I need to hang I think
I'm going to put it up right here over
the wicker basket I got from Hobby Lobby
and then that this one that looks like
leather that's really cool this is from
Lowe's it's like leather on the outside
but then it still has the cloth on the
inside like I said all this was in a
totally dinette so there are some things
I need to be added like a pot for this
plant but that's an Ikea this was a gift
from want to say Lancome this mere
jewelry box here's my Instax Mini Camera
so in here are all I shadow palettes
literally all these are full of
eyeshadow and then and here is all the
makeup that I want to test out or
include in like shot on shimmers videos
and then and this bag are all pretty
much Foundation to try out for a
foundation Friday and 50 made the
foundation so if I'm going to be doing a
shadow insurance video or something I
pretty much go into here this thing I
love this was also from Hobby Lobby if
you get anything more popular be make
sure it's on sale because they literally
just rotate out their sales every week
we sure got all the wicker baskets and
containers for like 40% off and there
are congratulate keep low so my sponges
really setting office things so up here
actually made this as a backdrop for
photos for Instagram stuff so all I did
with this was get a foam board from
Dollar Tree and this is actually stick
on adhesive wallpaper that just looks
like cement so I thought that I could
use this to hang on the wall to
backgrounds of like a shot himself using
things or for product shots and when I
do product shots
we just put it on the ground and make
sure there's good lighting and then take
it that way
so this little plant thing God this was
kind of like a space filler and I
figured if you ever don't want it in my
office I can just put it in our living
room
I definitely obviously need to get more
plans because I just have that one chill
in there whenever I come in I pretty
much always put my keys over there and
then just from this was also from Hobby
Lobby this was obviously fake all my
plans are face because I don't even try
to keep plants alive there are always
have a backup battery charging if you
film you should definitely do this
because it's the worst thing in the
world to run out of battery in the
middle of filming I have one of these in
my house and in the office I always have
a backup battery and I just have my
phone charger yes super exciting all
right so moving over to this area this
is where I store all the rest of my
makeup tip drawer all clothes and by the
way heart stuff
hell yes but I'm not going to go in
depth about what is inside of here
because I have a whole makeup collection
video I kind of switched around the
Jordan stuff when I made presenta unpack
everything and then reorganize it here
when I moved so these every sleeps you
IKEA Alex six drawers stacked on top of
each other so I just took the rollers
off and stacked them so they're bigger
and I like the wide drawers over many
ITL to nine drawers so on top of here I
think this is my favorite part the
foundation storage actually showed a lot
of this in my moving blog I blog the
whole process of moving in here and
organizing and everything with my dad if
you wanna see that video also will be
linked down below
basically the racks that are holding my
foundation are actually nail polish
tracks that I got off of Amazon and for
the most part they're the perfect size
for pretty much all foundations some of
the racks are actually more narrow and
some are smaller so it works out with
bigger and smaller foundations but as
you can see they totally fit five in
there whose are actually two just
screwed in next to each other I always
get questions about my brush holders
these are from H&amp;amp;M they're actually
toothbrush holders that I got I don't
think they still make them I haven't
been able to find them online anymore
these are the brushes that I don't use a
whole lot I have my everyday makeup
brushes at home and I actually usually
bring them back and forth this is the
blue snowball mic this is what I used to
fill on voiceover I never really do
voiceovers which is why the mic appears
not actually within all the drawers like
I said I have
we'll make a flexion video but I'll just
show you there's a few so here's all
single eyeshadows and primers here's
some highlighters highlighter Oh tweezer
all highlighters some contour products
this is all blush and this is all more
bronzers and kind of contours contour
palette these are all lipsticks these
are all nude liquid lipsticks these are
all darker red liquid lipsticks colored
ones colour-pop lippie stix eyelashes
these are not organized Oh obviously the
amount of makeup I have is excessive but
again this is a job for me so a lot of
products they get sent SPR or by them to
review them for you guys alright so now
let's do this part so it talks a lot
about natural lighting and why I'm
filming in my room and all this stuff in
one of the foundation Friday videos now
you can see I do have two huge windows
right here but I'm actually facing a
building so not a whole lot of direct
light comes in which is why I still have
to use my softbox light I love you just
have to make sure that you're far enough
away or else it's way too bright and you
can't dim them so when I film in the
office this is where I fit so this
pulled out desk I got from Roxas like 15
bucks and it's a lifesaver I think it's
supposed to be like a TV kind of
tabletop but it's perfect for filming
because I can just fold it up and that's
what I used in my room as well when I
was filming there / it's going on
filming there and it probably should
bring this back this chair pretty sure
got from Amazon or Wayfarer I want to
say Amazon finish this like a modern
kind of wire chair they had it in gold
and a couple of their colors to
Jackson's box I smoked it of course this
is the mirror film where did I get this
oh I got this off of HotList I get a lot
of stuff off of Pollock it's like
Nordstrom Rack Marshalls flash sale site
one of the reasons why I'm super excited
to be a little filming here was to be
able to have room for things that make
filming weight easier like having on one
my film I can see myself on a tiny
viewfinder this monitor rocks because
you can actually see yourself bigger on
a screen as you're filming so I used by
HDMI cord and you just hook that up to
your camera this stand is super
heavy-duty not really necessary for this
tiny monitor but if you like stand I
could find got that off of Amazon my
tripod also from Amazon and then this
leg down here going to use as a
background filler so when I filming I
typically put that like a high knee over
here so this singing plant thing I love
about this is Hobby Lobby so the big
plant and the silver thing that's
hanging in and just have that on a wall
I also had my doctrinal hole right under
it if you can see how there's a little
screw under there just so I can move it
if I want to because I thinking I could
film against that wall sometimes if I
wanted to so I feel really good news out
lower so that the plant is in the frame
that I wanted it to be behind here's a
file cabinet where I teach stuff for
taxes receipts all that kind of stuff
okay so onto this area so this is my
desk area over here this rub I'm in love
with I really like the look of
industrial kind of modern mixed with
more bohemian which is why I left this
rug is rugged from rugged USA breakfast
day is pretty much where I get all of my
rides is where I got our living room rug
my bedroom rug they have really good two
girls and they always do major sales I
love it if you want to get this exact
drug just be aware that it's majorly
majorly shed not really my dad because
I'm not sitting on it anything in here
and I don't really put my backpack or
purse or anything on it let's start in
this corner over here so one of the
things I wanted for sure in this space
was a good selfie mirror which actually
haven't utilized up a lot yet but this
is a mirror from Ikea I love this mirror
and makes the room look a lot bigger and
I have it kind of leaned in the corner
this little waste thing I got from rough
rocks is another place where I love to
get some stuff silver and kind of
glittery and I just think it looks
really cool with these palm fronds and
these palm fronds I got from Hobby Lobby
moving on to the best
this death is my favorite thing of life
anything it looks like white Markel so
this I'm super excited sure these guys
because I have been on the hunt for a
long fuge desk that was marble for
forever all the death I was finding were
either not long enough or they're super
expensive because it was marble so
figure out kind of legacy there why hack
for this so this is actually a IKEA
kitchen countertop so this is not real
white marble this is laminate pretty
sure with 80 bucks
a certain countertops is pretty durable
super long and then I just got these
scans also from Ikea each of the stands
and fascia were 10 or 15 bucks so
literally for about 100 110 dollars you
make a super long white marble table if
you don't like the white marble and you
want something else
check out the IKEA kitchen countertops
because they have ones that look like
wood and that looks like cement so they
should have some really cool designs in
there hello chief this white swivel
chair is from Amazon super comfy and
turns out it's exactly the exact same
chair my parents have in their office so
on the actual desk this is a cup warmer
I don't have a microwave in here so this
is really nice to just plug in over here
and if I have coffee I can just keep it
warm on here so the candle that was
gifted paint from things we may believe
maybe I'm not sure but it's a really
nice candle and I love this lid I'm
probably never going to burn that
because it love the look of it another
one of the things that just can make
your life way easier if you do a lot of
computer work or editing can be using a
bigger monitor do you want to buy a
whole new max computer so what I did is
just by this monitor from HP it looks
like really nice sleek kind of max
design once this was under 150 bucks and
you just get an HDMI cable so this cable
hooked up to my macbook and it's
literally just a double monitor so you
just split the monitor so I can edit and
I
edit on a bigger screen even though it's
being powered by my macbook
this is a trackpad over here so it's
just easier to edit rather than using
the tiny laptop thing because of my area
above my desk looks like I wanted
something that was clean but that wasn't
too minimalistic these were things I'm
really excited about are looking
everywhere for these and they used to
have someone Urban Outfitters I think
they have gold ones on there - I found
just a wire rack on Amazon and then my
dad just used little zip ties things to
secure this to the wall and then I just
got these metal clips to clip the art so
you can hear the gold clips if you want
you can get black ones a couple of these
things were just cut out from boxes that
I got from PR and stuff this is from
Laurie ologist really liked it and it's
like matte black these three prints
right here we're all from just been hell
and I do have a coupon to go for you
guys if you want to check it out if tons
of cheap flour on there that's really
cute and they kind of show you like how
to style it which ones go good together
so leave a coupon for that down below I
think it's only valid for a couple days
when this video goes legs and I just
great some big leaves over here that was
also from Hobby Lobby this one is
definitely my favorite beauty campaign
in the past couple year this is by
hourglass and it's their girls campaign
for letters that can change the world
just gold and wood shelf is from Hobby
Lobby this little mirrored thing is also
from Hobby Lobby notebook is from rock
you guys know I have a marble obsession
it's a little unhealthy and then this
print I do not recommend one say it was
society nine the actual print quality
for what I paid is pretty shitty it
looks like I printed it on my name jet
printer so that's pretty much the desk
area I bring my laptop from home to plug
it in when I work over here is actually
second or so
here in this corner this is what the
area looks like so this is kind of like
my coffee cart sink area monkeys Aldous
util the earth and this bar cart I got
from hot look so I have some tea
silverware and it's rose gold things on
my scissors the silverware was from Ross
this whole set was like six bucks this
marble cup was from ruff and then I just
have some colored pencils and stuff in
here on top shelf I have my Keurig
a couple coffee cups and then this
little cake up Buller thing this is from
Amazon and it just holds all my cake
above here I have this little mirror and
it has a little shelf right here just
cute you wanted to put like a fake plant
or whatever you want to put on there and
that was from Amazon my average little
Rose bulb lights up here that you switch
on and off with the battery right there
there we go I never opened this door so
I just left the battery same thing right
there
so this room came with a single here
which is really nice especially when I
do makeup and stuff because then I can
just wash my face afterwards if I want
to or in the morning this cow speaks to
me I got that from Ross is that not
perfection so on top of here I have
these brushes which are from morphe like
they're rhinestone brush collection I
don't think I'm ever going to be able to
use these and I got this little clear
container from Amazon that is one of the
prints like a week one from the place
that I do not recommend this little
weird is called terrarium geranium this
thing is from Hobby Lobby it kind of
just like DIY you just buy different
little plants and then I start some
white rocks in there this is one of my
favorite Hobby Lobby signs of
so I got this - she'll sing from hot
gulabi I can go literally 15 bucks and I
was looking on Etsy and I was looking
all over for some kind of industrial
looking unit so on here I just have some
random things they have some backhoe
body work soap lotion face wash candles
baton buddy works
perfume ugly because it just looks
really cool up here I'm gonna have a
couple face masks oh it's actually one
during my husband's left makeup removing
oils and then if you watch cloth and
makeup remover wipes shakes plants I
always get hot gulabi they have the best
fake plants there's a trash can little
need to empty you got that at Ross
diesels are reasonably priced and also
got one from way sir but I feel like the
Hobby Lobby our official plans look way
more real this is actually the thing
with that place that I have in my room
that I got it I'll be lobbying I can go
they don't feel like ten bucks and I
just like the X you guys know the X is
like my favorite emoji and then here's
the door where we said oh I want to show
you this so this backpack is really cool
so when I come to the office this is
what I soar my camera and lenses and
everything in it's actually camera bag
that looks like a backpack this is
awesome for class for 12 for traveling
too because you can also hold your
laptop in here so there's in the upper
compartment and I got the self of Amazon
these are some things you can close in
the bottom but here's a spot for your
laptop so let me bring back a lot come
over to edit so click it in here and
then there's also the bottom compartment
which is where to keep my DSLR camera
and my blog camera in here and then I
also have another one I just had to do
gone to worry about your camera getting
banged up and stuff and out of all the
camera bags this is definitely the most
stylish one I found so I love this
so here's another overview I think that
nothing to do have high-quality photos
of everything on my website which is the
Taylor comm if you want to check this
out
