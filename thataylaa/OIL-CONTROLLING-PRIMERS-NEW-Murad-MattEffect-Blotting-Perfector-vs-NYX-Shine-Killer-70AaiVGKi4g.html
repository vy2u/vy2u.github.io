brain right now
all right so today I wanted to do
another kind of half based wear test
primer kind of video so we're going to
be setting out to mattifying primer is
one of them is high-end and the other
one is drugstore or from Ulta this is
the Murad matte effect blotting
Perfector this is brand new it's a
cushion compact mattifier basically this
is the next shine killer primer I've
never tried either of these before we're
trying it out in this video do you guys
actually we're recommending this product
in the comments on one of my foundation
videos which is live pick this up and
then I was like hey we should I have
combination oily skin I get oily
throughout the day on my t-zone so as
soon as I saw this on the Sephora new
arrival page which I stock every day I
put this in my car and I bought it
because anything I can put underneath my
foundation to help me get less oily
throughout the day yes I want that I've
tried a bunch of different shine
Stoppers or mattifying kind of primers
and I haven't found one that I feel like
totally keeps my skin matte throughout
the day so this one has been getting
pretty good reviews on Sephora so far so
we'll see how it wears throughout the
day let's read some of the claims on
both of these products so starting with
the next shine killer this retails for
$13.99 on Ulta you can almost always get
NYX on sale either also or at the
drugstore I actually got this one on
Amazon with the free one-day shipping or
whatever for $11.99 I think it was you
get 0.67 ounces of product in here so
such as a foundation primer that
prepares skin for silky smooth makeup
application creates an invisible layer
that acts as a buffer to outside
elements helps makeup stay fresh and
color true for hours lasting all day and
well into the night online it says prep
your face with a foundation primer
before applying face makeup but on the
box says it can be worn over or under
makeup or without makeup just if you're
having to makeup free day and want to
keep the oil way so onto the Murad matte
effect blotting Perfector this retails
for $39 and you get zero point four
ounces of product so you do get a tiny
bit less in this product than the next
one this is exclusive to Sephora and it
is actually a compact product so it's
just like a cushion foundation you guys
will see during the application and
everything my thoughts on the packaging
so so this is a translucent liquid
blotting formula and then on the go
cushion compact that instantly modified
skin absorbs oil visibly minimizes pores
and perfects this unique formula dries
quickly and provides a touchable
softness of the skin
perfecting the look of skin those after
eight hours is supposed to keep the skin
modified and keeps the appearance of
pores minimized I do have pretty big
pores so we'll also see how what it does
to my pores eight hours isn't that long
so I'm hoping that my face is going to
stay modified for longer than that I
typically do 10 hour wear tests you can
use this underneath your makeup as a
primer or you can also touch up
throughout the day by just applying this
on the parts of your face that are oily
and it's supposed to help modify and
supposed to be okay to put on top of
foundation so that's all the claims on
both of these Murad and NYX are both
cruelty free we're going to keep these
bad boys on the entire day hopefully
it'll make me look less like a graceful
at the end of the night if you want to
see my thoughts on these oil controlling
products and how they apply and wear
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching I'm going to
need a lot of these today all right so
let's go ahead and clip back with that
hair so I think we're going to do the
Murad of blotting Perfector on this side
of my face and then the NYX shine killer
on the other side I've already washed
and moisturize my face obviously I'm not
primed yet super light packaging feels
pretty plasticy you know this is a
pretty cheap feeling compact so
definitely gonna use this as a primer on
the bottom and then I might try like a
portion of my face on top of the
foundation just so we can see if it's
different if you have to put on
foundation too so I just peeled this up
normally with cushion products there's a
sealant that you peel off to keep it
from drying out and I don't see a
sealant on here so it's interesting
no sealant you get like a liquidy light
pink consistency and it tends to do half
my noses doesn't really have a sense and
it feels nice and cooling actually feels
really good OOP I'm just kind of
pressing this on like a normal cushion
product I think that half of my face is
sufficiently covered whew woah it feels
like a powder almost it's super soft I'd
say it takes about 20 seconds to dry
down and it does look more matte for
sure than this side especially on my
forehead so let's go in with the NYX
shine killer on the other side so it
looks like a silicone consistency when
you squeeze it out go ahead and apply
yeah it just feels like a silicone
primer tiny bit more to the forehead I
don't know how you would apply this on
top of your foundation without ruining
the foundation so I guess
find out so I'm going to give these a
couple minutes to just kind of sink into
my skin my pores definitely look smaller
on this side right now I'm going to zoom
you guys in so hopefully you can see
this here are my pores on this side my
pores on this side do look a tiny bit
smaller time so for foundation I'm going
to be using the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer as a
floor review on this mucinous one for a
couple different reasons in this video
this one I know how it wears throughout
the day it does have more of like a
satin kind of finish this one by itself
can get a little bit oily on me
throughout the day so I feel like it'll
be a good one to test with these
products this is also the foundation
that I tested with the girl on
Katrice primers if you missed that video
I will put it in a lie over here I did a
half base test with those primers so I
think it'll be a good steady foundation
to just test out with primers whenever I
wear this I do mix in a little bit of my
white stargazer foundation this next
side actually now that it sunk in feels
less silicone II and feels closer to the
side this side still feels a little bit
more powdery and might as well show you
guys this brush and some of you on
snapchat were asking about it this is
the new pur cosmetics oval brush and
I've only used it with this foundation
this foundation is kind of unique the
way it blends out so I feel like I need
to test this with other products but I
like it with this foundation I'm not in
love with it I mostly just really need
to wash my foundation brushes which is
why we're using this whoa this is way
more matte than it normally is yeah this
looks like matte right now in this
foundation when I put it on normally has
a little bit of a glow to it I wouldn't
say it's harder to blend out with the
primer it just feels like it sets really
quick so I'm glad I did into my forehead
because I feel like you do have to work
in sections with this and with that
brush since it is so freaking huge I
usually have to go in with the second
brush and kind of get the areas that I
couldn't fully get like around the
eyebrows for me and then the hairline
this brush is really hard I'm going with
this e 56 brush and just kind of blend
this out it feels like it glides over
the next side a lot easier this one just
sets really quick and I have never tried
the artiste brush so I don't really have
anything to compare this brush to I mean
it's fine it's just not life changing in
my opinions yeah this side blends out a
lot smoother it looks a little bit
heavier on this side this side is just
kind of melting into my skin I wouldn't
say it looks cakey on this side you can
just see the texture a little bit more
but my pores on this side look way
better all right so here's a look at it
up close with the lights turned down it
definitely looks more glowy on this side
this is what the foundation normally
looks like this may be modified at a
tiny bit this looks very matte compared
to what it normally does so it is ten
twenty seven right now so we're going to
call the check-in time 10:30 I'm not
going to be applying a powder today
because I want to see how the primer is
control the oil not the powder so I'm
going to do the rest of my makeup and I
will be right back all right so it's now
who exactly 11 o'clock there you go so
the rest of my makeups on I'm going to
tell you guys everything that's on my
face in a second blending out blush
bronzer highlight I do feel like this
side blend it out super easily it felt
like I was blending on top of the powder
even though I haven't powdered my face
kind of side if I want to put part of
this over my face right now I think it
might make most sense to wait until the
next check-in because if I put it on
right now I think I'm just going to look
dry my forehead looks a little bit dry
on both sides but a little bit more on
this side right now so I'm gonna give my
skin a chance to produce some oil and
then we'll see if this kind of modifies
it so the bronzer used today is actually
new to me this is the Bobbi Brown
bronzing powder in the shade medium - I
got this when I was with Mallory in
Houston we both actually got this
because it looks like a really nice
reddish brown kind of bronzy shade which
is really hard to find where it doesn't
pull orange blush I use Physicians
Formula plum Rose blush this is the new
butter blush which smells amazing
highlight this is also new to me this is
laura mercier highlight 0-1 matte
radiance baked powder that is the most
deceiving name to me this is this is not
mad at all this is straight-up highlight
shade it looks totally different on your
face and it does in the pan I thought
this is going to be way too dark but
Mallory convinced me to get this and it
is beautiful for eyeshadow use the pur
cosmetics trolls palette which I've been
obsessed with this month it's going to
be in my raison reject video that video
will be going up before this so you guys
will have already seen that and in my
lips
Too Faced naughty ultra matte lip with
the Jordana soft cream sweet cream one
amazing sweet cream matte lip
cream buttercream frosting officiate
when the colour-pop one is still a
little bit wet I just tapped the jordana
one in the center of my lips to give it
a little more dimension so I'm going to
do my normal about 10 hour wear test I'm
going to check in with you guys in a few
hours and it will be in natural light
right so it is 4:30 so everything has
been on for six hours now so I'm filming
on the iPhone right now I hope I'm not
covering the speaker actually but it's
on the 4k video app so it should be okay
quality to see everything so both sides
to me right now are looking pretty much
identical there might be a little bit
more adieu coming through on my forehead
on the next side actually it looks a
little bit more matte on this side
around my nose but everything else I
think is looking pretty similar and I do
have the kitchen light on right now so
that's the light that you're seeing
right there so should I blot it I'm
gonna blot at the end of the night if I
have some oil but let's just see how it
holds up with these two all right so
it's now 1008 so it's been on for almost
12 hours this is a super long check-in
and have some thoughts so this side of
my face definitely is more oily to me
the NYX shine killer side the side is
oily on my forehead to keep in mind that
I have a light on so it's reflecting off
of it but in the mirror this side
definitely looks more oily overall this
is way more modified and around my nose
area especially is where I see a
difference my chin looks really bad on
both sides I don't know what it is but I
feel like I majorly broke out today kind
of on both sides all over I mean I have
this a major new acne down here today
and also looks very separated on my chin
and then here my pores look pretty large
and super shiny and as you can see this
side is more modified it doesn't look
great still like it still looks a little
bit caked up around my nose but this
side for sure looks better on my nose
area feel like that's a huge difference
right there for head I think looks about
the same on both sides so overall
thoughts this side I feel like really
didn't do anything for my oil this side
I do like how it modified on my nose
area since you can't apply this over the
product we're going to try that out I'm
going to do the next shine killer and
the Murad and top just to see if you're
someone who does like blotting
throughout the day
to see if this would kind of mattifies
I'm just going to go on the forehead
first because that's where I have most
oil right now
and I don't know how this isn't going to
take off my foundation so that
definitely mattified you can see on here
it came off a little bit but yeah it's
back to like that powder you cannot
finish do it around my nose this area is
still pretty matte on my cheeks I'm
going to my chin I do feel like it's
taking off some of the products but
compared to this side I mean that
totally mattified it especially on the
forehead not bad I probably wouldn't put
this on top of the Foundation's because
I don't want it to take off anything but
I do like it for underneath foundation
especially if you just keep concentrated
on your oily areas so as you can put
this thing over it too so let's try
around the nose area I'm just going to
kind of dab that definitely took off
some product strands 4head I can feel my
grease on the side it might need a
minute to kind of set in there but I
don't like the NYX shine killer on top
of product that just took away a lot and
think it did a whole lot of mattifying
this is just out to party right now so
overall this one I don't think did a
whole lot at all I didn't really see too
much of a difference at the beginning or
throughout the day I'm definitely going
to continue to use this and try it out
I'm hoping this didn't break me out but
I love that you can actually see a
difference especially if you have bigger
pores I mean this one did modify that
side of my face keep in mind that I
didn't set my face today with the powder
so whenever I set the Clinique
foundation it does hold up better
throughout the day so my future self is
popping in here and I have used this
about three times since filming this
video now and I have really mixed
feelings on it some foundations I do
think it helps mattify for sure and
others like the derma call when I use
this with I see no difference at all you
also have to be really careful about
having it cake up around your nose
I've noticed that with some products it
can do that so I think this one's kind
of hit or miss depending on the
foundation you're using do I think it's
worth it I don't know I think you got to
try it out with your favorite foundation
