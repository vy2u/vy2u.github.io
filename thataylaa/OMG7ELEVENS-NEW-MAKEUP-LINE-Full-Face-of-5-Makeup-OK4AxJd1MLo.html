all right so today we're gonna be trying
out 7-elevens very own makeup line
I spent $75 on 7-eleven makeup bro you
put the Cheetos under the makeup party
fell so as I walked through the glorious
doors of 7-eleven I was kind of ecstatic
because where else can you buy hot
cheetos a bag of makeup and boxed wine
actually I guess you could do that at
every single drugstore the 7-eleven has
Slurpees you can't compete with Slurpees
so I know what my plans are tonight so
in the past couple weeks 7-eleven
launched the cosmetics line is actually
called simply me beauty I was hoping it
would just have 7-eleven on it pure
class
there are 40 products in the line which
is pretty large to launch with so
everything in the line is priced between
3 and 5 dollars there's nothing over
$4.99 so I got enough products to do a
full face using 7-eleven makeup I was
reading the press release on their
website here's my favorite quote for a
millennial working woman wanting to
refresh her makeup while grabbing lunch
at 7-eleven stores simply me beauty is a
welcomed offering and his price just
right for her
they say millennial aged women like 50
times in this press release so that's
really who they're targeting here I
typically go to 7-eleven for gas if it's
the only thing around or for taquitos
listen I've tried dollar makeup I've
tried Dollar Tree makeup
booooo-whoo makeup there are some great
makeup products are very affordable I
don't care if something's $30 or
something's $1 if it's good it's good
and usually in these videos I do find at
least one thing that I think is pretty
good so that's that I'm excited for this
video if you're excited for this video
too don't forget to give this a thumbs
up below you're watching if you're new
here you can join the baby Rito family
and subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time
so let's do this here we go alright so
I've already washed moisturize in prime
my face they didn't have a primer there
did however get a sponge I've tried so
many sponges at this point that I can
kind of spot the ones that are gonna be
friggin golf balls as far as hardness
goes if this one looks like it's gonna
be a golf ball er but I like the
packaging of this line everything is
this black and gold kind of packaging so
I think it's nice and sleek oh yeah it's
a golf ball this is actually pretty tiny
so let's see how big this thing gets
when I
dampen it I'm back and this thing is the
same friggin size might be like this
much bigger so I'm going to try this one
half my face and then go in with my la
girl sponge on the other obviously quite
a bit bigger and much squishier so they
only carry BB creams they didn't have a
foundation so I just got the BB cream in
the shade light you do get two fluid
ounces of product that's a lot of
product fifty-nine milliliters to
compare in leo le BB cream you get 50
milliliters smells like paint just to
avoid the sponge soaking up as much as
possible I'm gonna go ahead and put some
of my face first and then let's try and
blend it out with this thing this is so
tiny
okay oh yeah feeling great so that
sucked up everything like 98% product so
instead on this side I'm gonna try and
do a brush actually bit tone down my
redness a tiny bit but that's pretty
much it so I'm just using the Sigma f80
right now I'm just stippling this on
definitely getting better coverage I
wore a turtleneck on purpose for this
video because I had a feeling this would
be too dark okay it looks nice and glowy
and skin like it kind of just looks like
a you know BB cream tinted moisturizer
it's not clinging anywhere it looks
really good actually
coverage is pretty light freckles and
everything are still coming through the
shade was right on me I wouldn't mind
this it always looks lighter on camera
but in real life it looks about three
shades too dark right now and it does
look like it's darkening already by the
way I haven't watched any videos on this
yet I know there are already a couple
out there but I purposely didn't want to
watch I'd be surprised it's a very glowy
very glow so if you don't like dewy you
wouldn't like this at all did get a
little bit better coverage I feel like
with the brush I'm gonna try and build
this up a little bit though I don't
think it's very buildable now that it's
on my face it does look a borderline
greasy yeah I mean this is pretty pretty
oily looking I do have a translucent
powder here but first we're gonna go in
with their high-def concealer so this
isn't the shade light I think in this
one they had three shades I'm gonna try
and use this underneath my eyes
depending on what this color looks like
and then also to spot conceal a little
bit in the packaging it looks darker
than the foundation looks very an odd
concealer color not even yellow it's
like very camel tan but we're gonna roll
with it so I'm gonna use my fingers
first kind of blend this out looks to be
light coverage again very glowy I'm
gonna try just add a little bit of
coverage you know this is kind of light
coverage I get a little bit of a burning
yep
that concealer I would say is light
coverage very luminous you can still see
darkness freckles and stuff coming
through so this powder says all shades
is translucent and it's a matte powder
looks kind of like Mac packaging feels
really soft that is not translucent
folks I'm actually gonna try I think and
powder my under eyes with this it
doesn't really have a scent to it seems
to be darkening my under eyes a bit
shade aside it doesn't look bad it looks
at pretty smooth under there it has a
really soft feel to it I'm gonna add
just a touch of my Physicians Formula
powder just so I can lighten everything
up a bit because this is pretty dark I
feel like around my nose area I look
pretty oily so I'm gonna take the same
powder just press them in there
I typically really enjoy a dewy forehead
I don't know if I want a powder but I
also feel like this is very very dewy
looking we're gonna sit on it I'm gonna
leave it like this for a minute
actually want to use the same powder
though and I'm just gonna apply this
right to my cheek area just so when I go
to blend out bronzer and highlight and
stuff it doesn't stick because this is a
very sticky product it hasn't really set
down at all okay so let's get some brows
going got this brow powder and wax in
the shade dark they had a dark and a
light one just a wax and then a powder
the powder that looks pretty dark so I'm
gonna go ahead and use the wax first
this just helps the powder stick and
I'll
helps your brow hair just kind of stay
in place that looks like it has actually
color to it you could totally use that
on its own as like a dip brow kind of
thing I'm use the darker powder shade
just I think on the outer half kind of
like the tail that powder feels pretty
pigmented yeah that's a little swatch of
it for an eyebrow product that could be
like an eye shadow but it totally works
I like it a little bit better without
the black in there but I'm very excited
to try this bronzer I have the shade Sun
glow it says matte and shimmer bronzer
oh can you guys see that I think I just
got like a rash I'm totally getting a
weird rash right now I've been getting
eczema on my hands off and on from the
accutane but my hand is kind of like
burning right now onto bronzer I think
this lighter shade could work so that
other shade actually might be a really
nice I shadow again feels really soft
seems to be getting a little bit
splotchy and patchy could be the BB
cream underneath but again I did powder
right here so it should blend easily on
top I'm just gonna go over this side of
it with my sponge kind of tone it down
they had two different blushes both were
split pan again this is in the shade
Rose a super soft again the powders are
very soft I'm gonna go in with that
middle orange g1 right there I just
lightly tap because I had a feeling this
was gonna be pigmented this one you kind
of have to work with a little bit again
not the easiest to blend out but the
shade is nice once you get it blended
out and you literally need the tiniest
amount like I super lightly tapped in I
like the shade the shade is really
pretty Oh have I had eyelash glue on
this whole time cool this is the radiant
highlighter I'm really glad they did a
powder highlighter wow this one looks
pretty yellow it's showing up most true
to color right there that is how yellow
it looks in real life very yellow like
not even at champagne or like a yellow
gold it looks pretty yellow I'm actually
gonna go in with this tangerine kind of
shade right here
oh that looks totally different on than
it does in the pan this is the orange
one okay that's really pretty
not that I really need any more glue
right now that's pretty almost looks
like the hourglass ambient metallic
strobe lighting palette had to say the
full name there apparently has the same
kind of effect if anything so far get
this don't know about this shade next up
we have eyes shadow they didn't have an
eye primer there so I'm just gonna use
my usual
eye primer this is the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot for eye shadow they had three
different kind of strip eyeshadow
palettes in here it looks like there's
one two three four five shades had kind
of like a warm one they had a pinky
purple one and then they had this one
which has some like blues I was what the
shadows look like on the inside I'm
really drawn to this dark blue right now
didn't really think through the whole
blue and yellow shirt thing but it might
in my work ooh that shade looks really
pretty look at that one start out for
the crease I'm gonna go in with that
same bronzer shade I used yeah even as
eyeshadow it's looking pretty patchy
about three different lip options so I
can kind of go either way but I have a
red lipstick that I kind of want to use
so I think if I did the red that one
would look nice I'm actually gonna start
out with the black to smoke it out first
I'm just gonna kind of pack this on like
the outer third this seems to be pretty
powdery it's kind of like jumping around
I'm just gonna go ahead and really
lightly blend out these edges this feels
like one of those shades that is just
gonna kind of really easily blend too
far so I'm just gonna like very very
lightly blend these edges now I'm gonna
go with that really pretty looking shade
almost looks like it makes up like army
green and brown and I'm very into army
green right now I'm gonna first just
place it on my eye with a brush and then
I'll probably use my finger or wet it
whew just kind of blending it in fading
it into that black a little bit hard to
just use your finger in here because of
how close these are together oh we
definitely got a little more there we
need to do some blending I'm gonna go
back in with the bronzer but now I'm
gonna take this shade right here and I'm
just gonna blend the top edge of that
super lightly cuz I don't want it to get
super muddy should I say super again so
the shadows not the easiest to work with
but you can make them work I think I
literally blended for about 15-20
minutes I'm gonna go back in with this
warm shade and I'm gonna line my lower
lash line with this and I'm just gonna
blend that out I might actually take
this highlight again yeah I'm gonna put
that on the inner corner down here
should we try the yellow one let's do it
so again this one applied looks a lot
lighter than it does in the pan but it
still has a yellow kind of greenish tint
to it not something that I would be able
to pull off on my skintone it looks like
a little light lime green but it's
pretty on the inner corner I didn't see
a pencil liner but I did see a liquid
eyeliner so we're gonna do this matte
black packaging here and it has a nice
weight to it this has a pretty large
felt tip applicator
not the blackest and it looks a little
bit crusty or something I do have false
lashes that I got there so I don't know
if I want to do a wing
I might just kind of do a smudge smudge
action it's kind of angle it up and then
just going with a liner brush and I'm
just gonna smudge with this brush
nothing on here okay not a fan of
eyeliner the wet-and-wild proline
eyeliner is a few bucks and it's great
so if you're looking for one that's
around the same price point go with that
one instead got the volume and length
black mascara oh oh what am i scare was
this that covergirl one I used it in the
shadow inch mousse this has that weird
spiky thing on the end that's supposed
to be for getting kind of the harder to
reach lashes definitely quite a dry
formula yeah this feels really dry this
feels like when you need to toss out
your mascara but it's giving some length
not bad I just personally like a little
bit more of a wet formula so they had
two pairs of false lashes I got the full
Fogle ashes they had another one that
looked kind of like the ardell demi
whispies my lash glue keeps disappearing
today this happened earlier too so I'm
gonna go in with bottom lash mascara use
that same one and I do like those lashes
by the way they feel nice and
lightweight a little bit itchy of a band
how sometimes the clear band is like a
little bit pokey or something I did trim
each side by like how these look
alright we are on to the final step here
which is lipstick so I got three
different lip products and I kind of
want to try them all they had these lip
crayons they also had lip glosses and
then lip sticks so they had three
different shades of the lip gloss I
think they had a purpley one like a
fuchsia and then this light pink shade
and then I think they also had three of
these shades lipsticks they had at least
three I feel like they might have had a
couple more so I think I want to put
this on and then go over it with that
gloss so this is nice it has a twist up
right here
oh that's a pretty shade has a slight
shine to it feels nice going on it
smells like the crown actually smells
exactly like a crown feels really nice
and comfortable doesn't feel like it's
gonna slide all over and like transfer
onto my teeth doesn't feel drying at all
let's see this gloss so this isn't the
shade rose' ooh thought I got a whiff
smells like vanilla smooth not too
sticky at all it feels like the
colour-pop glosses actually I like that
combo too just added a little bit of
pink to it
the applicator one feels very cheap it
has that kind of like stiff Clair's kind
of feel to it did a whole video testing
out Claire's makeup so that's what this
come look like I'm gonna take this off
now let's go in with this lipstick so it
says that say cream lipstick and this is
in the shade Clementine this packaging
feels very cheap I almost just cracked
that in half squeezing it but the shade
looks promising ooh I hope this is like
neon oh yeah so the color is beautiful
the shade of this is beautiful
the formula feels very moisturizing but
almost to the point where it's a little
bit oily feeling it feels like this is
definitely gonna slide around like this
is gonna be off your lips and on your
face almost feels like Vaseline or
something like it's almost too creamy I
think between the two lipsticks I would
definitely go for this one I just prefer
the way this feels on my lips more so
this is the final look testing out
7-eleven makeup I hope you guys enjoyed
this don't forget to give this a thumbs
up if you did let me know which thing
you liked the best I think I'm
definitely most into the highlighter I'm
very pleasantly surprised got a little
scared for a minute but this is
beautiful like I would for sure use this
again I'll probably use it tomorrow
that's what I'm most into I like the
shade of the blush but something about
the blush and bronzer are really
difficult to blend out pretty patchy
concealer and BB cream or passes for me
looks too oily to me it looks very very
greasy mascara I would pass on lashes
I like how they look just be aware if
you're going to get them that they do
feel pretty cheap II you know
I mean sponge is a hard pass no pun
intended the brow product I like just
don't put on your hand I definitely use
the wax shade again just on its own I
like that the wax has a little bit of a
color to it I shadow
I like the lid shade I like the overall
look how it turned out now but I feel
like I just really had to work with all
the shadows the eye liner is a note for
me like I said get the one wild one I
think that's everything so everything I
love you guys thanks for watching see in
my next video bye e now let's break out
the good stuff they literally look like
this Cheetos bag right now hmm
forgot how hot these are I've been out
