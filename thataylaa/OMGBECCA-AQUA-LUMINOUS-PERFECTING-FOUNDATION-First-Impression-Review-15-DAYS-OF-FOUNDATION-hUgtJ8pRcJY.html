is day 15 of 15 days of foundation
season five all of the other days days
one through fourteen are linked down
below in the playlist comment down below
say hey introduce yourself if you're new
here you found my channel through this
series this time around before we get
into the foundation this is obviously
the last day so I need to make a couple
announcements the first thing is that
the merch shop 100% of the proceeds go
to project be sure that shop is still
open until April 9th when the wrap up
video goes up we're trying to raise
$20,000 I'll pin a comment with what the
current total is but we sell a few more
days to get to our goals so thank you
guys so much for all of your support
with this and everything last thing is
that voting ends tonight so we're gonna
know what the winning shelter and the
winning City is be announcing it in the
video on April 9th but that's the
shelter that's gonna win $5,000 and I'm
gonna be doing a meet-up in that city so
stay tuned for meetup details we
basically have about a week to find a
place to do the Meetup
so all the details for the meetup are
gonna be coming in the wrap-up video and
ranking wrap-up video is also where I
rank the foundations 1 to 15 after I've
tested them some more tried them in
different ways I just realized I did not
put bottom lash mascara today let's uh
let's do that I think I said everything
I have to say let's get into day 15s
foundation this is the Becca aqua
luminous perfecting foundation this one
has been out for a while the thing that
totally piqued my interest about this
thing is that I'm like a pretty diehard
Becca Tilly fan if you had no idea who
Becca Tilly is she was on The Bachelor
but don't judge until you've listened to
a couple episodes of her podcast
scrubbing in with Becca Tilly she is
hilarious and her makeup artist always
uses this foundation on her and her skin
looks so glowy so flawless ever since I
found out this was the fact
she was using I wanted to try it out I
picked it up so we're gonna see how it
is so Becca and Becca don't let me down
those foundation retails for forty four
dollars it has one fluid ounce of
product it says it blurs it has a
luminous finish light buildable coverage
feels ultra light and it gives you a
soft focused glow so it is supposed to
be buildable a says it has luminous
pearls it adapts to the skin to create
shade flexibility so this only comes in
nine shades I have the lightest shade
porcelain but it does say it's supposed
to kind of adapt to your skin tone which
is apparently why they only have nine
shades we'll see but I'm gonna start
swatches right here so you can see how
the shade of porcelain compares to some
my other foundations
all right swatches I just had on a
jacket so it's like arm creasing right
there here's the Becca aqua luminous
foundation in the lightest shade
porcelain next over is CYO life proof
and 101 NARS radiant foundation and
Montblanc dermal called 2:08 NARS sheer
glow in Siberia and Loreal Pro glow and
201 this apparently is the allure 2016
best of beauty Award winner I have no
idea how they judged that thing you know
who knows they could be kind of like
paid placement type of things but
apparently this is a best-selling
foundation it's rated pretty highly on
Sephora so see how it is so if you're
excited for day 15 and you've enjoyed
this series season 5 don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up I appreciate
it Becca aqua luminous perfecting
foundation here we go
we have just a few stripes going on
today I really like the bottle of this
it looks really nice and sleek to me I
love the frosted glass it feels very
heavy though so probably not one that
you'd want to like travel with a whole
lot size shake well before use I've
already washed moisturize prepped my
skin okay so this twists up and then I'm
assuming you press and it probably has
the dropper kind of thing would okay you
have to keep turning it after this has
popped up and you get a dropper wooo
this shade looks like so me good okay so
it supposed to be buildable coverage but
light off the bat I have a feeling a
brush is gonna do better with this one
just because it is so kind of light and
watery but we're so I'm going to do half
my face with a sponge half with a brush
and start out with a brush on this side
of my face dude
I can't believe it's day 15
what feels really lightweight and like
buttery smooth going on it smells like
it has that gingerbread scent that some
makeup has it smells like a digestive oh
it's looking beautiful super glowy but
as I'm blending it out it feels like
it's kind of setting when I first put it
on it had that same buttery feel as the
Maybelline fit me doing smooth if this
doesn't oxidize I would wear this shade
on its own I think it's looking really
pretty true test is my forehead it does
look like I need to smooth this over
with a sponge right in this area but the
rest of my face is looking beautiful I
love how this area looks let's try the
sponge on the other side now that I
figured out this packaging I actually
really like it because it just twists
shut and then snaps so it's like not
gonna leak or anything sponges have been
like not cutting it for me lately the
undertone of this is really nice so even
though it is a little bit dark I feel
like it can work I think I got a little
bit higher coverage I'd say this side is
high light coverage the site is light
coverage I want to build this up in
certain areas just to see cuz it is
supposed to be buildable and smoothing
over at this side I think the way I like
to apply this one is brush first and
then smooth out the finish with a sponge
so I'm gonna try and build this up a
little bit with the brush oh maybe not
almost got like a little bit streaky or
something with the brush on that second
layer so maybe sponge is the way to go
on a second layer I have barely any
product by the way I'm just building up
on top of my scarring and stuff
definitely building looks like medium
coverage now right now I am loving the
way that this looks I'm gonna blend this
down my neck more because it is a little
bit dark dang it I'm just blending this
all the way down yeah I think we got
this up to about medium coverage but the
finish looks beautiful I love how glowy
and fresh this looks looks pretty good
around my nose upper lip forehead it
feels sticky still so I'm gonna
powder this part of my face right now
it's 935 but I'll be back in a few with
the rest I makeup on it's now 10:30 8:00
so check-in time is 10 o'clock that this
part of my face with the Sephora micro
smooth powder and I also set just around
my hairline kind of I didn't set right
on the center of my forehead because
powder tends to not look the best there
but it is looking beautiful I love the
way my skin looks right now as reading
through the description again and it
said it's supposed to kind of adjust to
your skin tone which is why they only
have nine shades which I don't think
it's true at all at least on my skin I
didn't find that it addressed it at all
if anything it just oxidized so far if
you're into glowy foundations this one's
looking beautiful I think it just looks
really healthy glowy fresh what other
adjectives can we throw in there yeah
it's just looking really nice have no
complaints right now I'm gonna show you
guys what this looks like in natural
lighting and then we'll do a flash test
we are in front of the window right now
and natural lighting it looks so pretty
so glowy whoo that Mac highlight though
I think this would probably be too much
glow for some people but you could
always just powder more I personally
like this glow especially on my dry skin
now it just tends to look a lot more
flattering and healthy and emphasizes
everything a little bit less so let's go
do a flash test my battery light is
flashing right now so please survive
like 30 seconds oh it doesn't look bad
does not look bad and flash out totally
wear that so on the rest of my face I
use the Kevyn Aucoin Celeste Yule
bronzing veil I'm just going with this
light shade right here I love this as a
contour for a highlight I used the Mac
real hyper real blow this palette this
is so pretty
I love this light shade right here I've
used this a shit-ton I also have this
shade on my lids and then this shade on
my inner corner this gives you that like
blinding highlight look I use a really
light hand with it and this is the look
that I get but you can build this up to
a frigging blinding highlight use the
jus a blush duo and Coquette I just go
int this light pink shade my eyes I
tried out the Urban Decay backtalk
palette which I was not impressed by at
all weird packaging it has double sided
blush and eye shadow but the packaging
the mirror comes out which you think
would be cool but it basically just like
slides all over
the eyeshadows and the blushes I'm not a
fan of this factoring I'll probably talk
more about this in another video but oh
and just ding the blush packaging aside
the eyeshadows I wasn't that into I
actually had to use the blush shades for
my eyeshadow because they had more
pigmentation for lips I use the Mac
Patrick Starr edge-to-edge liner this is
the first time I use this and it's like
a very kind of fuchsia tone on my skin
tone so and I topped it off with
Smashbox peddle metal I love this
metallic shade is such a pretty pinky
peachy rose gold kind of metallic lip
for the formula these feel so smooth and
buttery so that's my makeup oh and then
I'm wearing I lower accents 0:05 my
lashes I will see you guys in a few
hours in natural lighting for the next
check-in it is 751 so it's been on for
almost 10 hours and you guys I am loving
this one I've been looking at my face
throughout the day
ignore my under-eye concealer right now
I've been trying different under-eye
powders because I cannot for the life of
me find a good combo right now for my
under eyes it's like crease city but my
foundation I am loving this the way that
it's sitting on my skin
there isn't one area where I don't like
how it's looking throughout the whole
day like for 10 hours away last reckon I
did was at the 5 hour point I'm gonna
insert some footage right here so you
can see what it looked like but range is
here so I'm just voicing over this part
but it looked beautiful Rach said that
looked really good she liked how it
looked she actually liked the shade on
me and the shade I think is actually
it's growing on me it is a little bit
dark but I think it just adds a little
bit of life to my skin so I do like the
shade because I think the undertone is
right I think it looks so smooth and
dewy if this is how good it looks with
10 hours without a primer and a setting
spray I cannot wait to use those two
things to see how much even how much
even better how much better it can look
English this one could do well on mature
skins as it didn't settle in anywhere I
didn't settle into my lineup here or
around my mouth great to see her picking
up her stuff lately skin I feel like
this is one that you would probably have
to set just because of how dewy and
glowy this one is
Rach what do you think of it now
okay Rach just said what she thinks of
it right as my memory card got full yeah
color looks nice it looks glowy but it
doesn't look like oily really this one
I'm excited so I hope you guys enjoyed
