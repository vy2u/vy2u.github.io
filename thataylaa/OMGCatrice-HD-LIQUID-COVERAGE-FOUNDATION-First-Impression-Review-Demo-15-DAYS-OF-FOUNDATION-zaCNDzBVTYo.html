all right so today it's day six of 15
days of foundation this is a new first
impression video every single day for 15
days 6 p.m. Pacific time I have no idea
if I just wore this t-shirt in another
video I've been filming so much that I
don't even know so here we are again
shout out to my favorite $6 Ross t-shirt
but today we're talking about a
foundation that I am very excited to try
out because I haven't heard anything
about this product
I believe it's new that this is the
Catrice cosmetics HD liquid coverage
foundation 24 hour so Catrice you can
purchase on Ulta retails for 1099 and
you get one point zero one fluid ounce
as a product so a tiny tiny bit more
than one fluid ounce downside to this is
that it only comes in four shades right
now could just be because it's new
products I've the lightest shade light
beige zero one zero the darkest shade is
warm beige zero four zero and reading
some of the reviews on ulties website it
seems like that's kind of just like a
medium skin tone so they don't have a
deep shade for this at all they also
don't have a very fair shade but you
guys will see since this is kind of a
liquid dropper foundation this would be
really easy to mix with other products
like the cover effect drops or something
so if one of the four shades doesn't
match you you could use it to mix but
the claims on this thing it says it
covers imperfections mattifies the skin
creating a smooth and even complexion
for up to 24 hours ultra lightweight
high coverage foundation for a natural
looking finish and on the bottle it says
it is full coverage not an oily texture
that feels like a second skin provides
long lasting full coverage without a
mask effect and it says it has an HD
finish ready for camera-ready skin so
all that sounds great we'll see how it
applies and wears throughout the day I'm
gonna insert swatches right here of the
shade zero one zero light beige compared
to some of the other foundations I own
so you can see how the shade is okay so
swatch time right here's the
Treece liquid coverage foundation in the
lightest shade 0/10 light beige next
over his cover FX custom cover drops in
n 10 derma called 2:08 pur cosmetics
bear at all in porcelain Urban Decay
Naked skin foundation and 0.5 and
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 if you've been enjoying 15 days of
foundation so far don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up it helps me out
so if you want to see what I think at
the Catrice HD liquid coverage
foundation and how it applies somewhere
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching alright we are
even close to today still trying to
adjust the camera lights everything
trying to figure out the best quality
and lighting and everything with you
being able to see you my face I've had
approximately two sips of coffee this
morning
typically with liquid kind of dropper
foundations like this I don't like using
a sponge because I find that it just
absorbs a lot of the product since I try
it with every foundation will do one
half of my face with a sponge and the
other half with my ELF foundation brush
I'm about to go get Starbucks bagel and
coffee right after filming this
I'm excited given this a good shake I've
already washed moisturize prime my face
I might just drop this directly on my
face to start maybe let's try it oh this
is also nice because usually when I feel
them farther away I can't do this okay
so here's a little dropper guy don't
focus on me please come back well I was
gonna miss the bottle it does say it's
supposed to be full coverage it doesn't
say how many drops you need for full
coverage so I'm just gonna go in oh and
that just went right on my shirt sweet
so I'm gonna be changing my shirt but
okay so I guess I'm gonna start out with
that amount let's see ooh feels like it
dries very quickly oh this is good
coverage
yeah it's drying pretty quickly so I'm
guessing you want to work in sections of
this one that is looking freakin
flawless like the finish of it looks
like satin matte but it doesn't look
heavy at all I don't think I want to
drop it on my face again because I'm not
trying to get my white shirt covered in
foundation so I'm just gonna drop some
on the palette don't really know how
many drops that just was because I was
trying to get a thumbnail but I think it
was like - hey three that is covering my
acne rise - like a satin matte finish
pretty quickly like almost as soon as
you put on your face it is a bit dark
it's not showing up totally on camera
I'd say it's a
a shade too dark for me maybe even a
shade in half hopefully it doesn't
oxidize but the undertone is nice it has
kind of like a beige neutral undertone
to it doesn't like totally off because
of the undertone
dang what about coverage it's matte but
it looks like a really beautiful soft
focus kind of matte finish very
smoothing which I like since I have a
ton of texture so let's see how much
coverage I get on this side with a
sponge
I'm just gonna go ahead and dip the
sponge into the remaining product oh
yeah definitely lighter coverage with
the sponge you can build it up with a
sponge to get similar coverage I still
think it's a little bit more full
coverage on the brush side I feel like
I'm using a little bit more product with
a sponge to get the same kind of
coverage but the finish looks really
nice whoo oh my god going over the
foundation brush side with this one is
just kind of smooth it out literally
makes it look frickin flawless and
airbrushed
holy cease that looks freaking
beautiful I'm gonna go over a little bit
with the brush on this side just on my
acne if I can get a little bit more
coverage seems to build totally fine
it's not kicking up anywhere or anything
I think the best way to apply it is
going with a brush if you want that
coverage and then just go back in with
this sponge to kind of smooth it out
like I have no complaints right now so
I'm definitely not gonna powder my face
with this one because it dries down to a
powder finish pretty quickly it's also
supposed to last 24 hours and it says
it's mattifying so there you go right
now it's 937 we'll call the track in
time 9:40 I'm gonna do a really basic
makeup today because I have to go the
doctor and I have some errands to run so
does not gonna be super exciting makeup
or anything I need to change my shirt
protip but don't try and drop this on
your face okay I haven't even finished
my makeup yet but I walked in here
looked in the mirror and I have to show
you guys this look at how frickin smooth
and pretty this looks
such good coverage looks beautiful I am
so far really feeling this really
branched out went with another black and
white striped shirt but it's now 1004
the rest of my makeup is on and it looks
so freakin beautiful
I took a clip in natural lighting the
coverage is amazing my forehead looks
awesome my texture down here right now
looks pretty good it's great around my
nose and my pores it's looking a bit
lighter on camera the shade is
definitely a little bit off but I think
it can work for me you have the cover FX
drops that could be an option I love
those the cover FX drops are really dewy
so actually that with the Catrice ones
might be a really beautiful finish so
far I'm really feeling this thing we'll
see how it wears throughout the day I'm
curious to see how this controls my oil
tube because I do have combination skin
I get oily throughout the day almost for
us chili was on my face so for bronzer i
use maybelline master bronze in the
shade 10 i use this one right here blush
I went in with Tarte doll face again
we're gonna bake at Bella Rose you go
girl your eyes went in with the Tarte
clay play palette again you solstice and
journey these two shades right here
normal mascaras and then for lips i use
the morphe liquid lip in Sasha this is
such a pretty like purple mob kind of
color and that is everything so again
check-in time is 9:40 will see you guys
in a few hours in natural lighting
alright so right now it's 2:40 so it's
been on for five hours overall I think
it still looks really pretty the only
thing I'm noticing is some creasing on
my upper lip as I'm you guys in creasing
right here on me is pretty typical with
most foundations but I do have crazy
right there it's looking a little bit
heavy around my nose on this side but my
forehead I think still looks really nice
it's definitely too dark I was out
running errands I don't know if you guys
can tell here's my neck color but yeah
it's definitely a couple shades dark I
got glances in the mirror and stuff and
but other than that I'm still really
liking how it looks it doesn't look like
my skin is getting very oily which is
nice so I'll check back in with you guys
at the end of the night now 741 so it's
been on for ten hours and I want to show
you guys in this lighting cuz I feel
like it's more accurate than the window
this time of night I think you can tell
this lighting but it has oxidized like
two shades at least I mean that's
definitely it solid three shades too
dark for me at this point my chest looks
really red
look at my face right now it doesn't
look necessarily bad like I've
definitely had foundations look worse
but I don't think it's worn amazing on
my skin I look a little bit oily it's
breaking down a tiny bit on the center
of my forehead creasing around my nose
area and upper lip didn't seem to get
majorly worse kind of came off on my
neck area I probably had my hand there
or something on my skin this definitely
would not be 24 hours I think it looks
good up until about the eighth hour
point love how it went on love the
coverage the finish of it it's beautiful
I think I would really like mixing this
one so I'm going to try mixing it in
with a couple different foundations to
lighten it and also just see if it helps
with the longevity update you guys my
thoughts in the final ranking video
where I rank all the foundations 1 to 15
but so far out of all the 5 days
this one is definitely at the top of the
list so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and you're excited for the rest 15
days foundation if you are don't forget
to give this a thumbs up I just cleaned
my entire bathroom and now it smells
like bleach it smells so good I was like
the most satisfying thing I love you
guys thanks for watching see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
