called we carry your favors
I'm excited alright I am stoked for
today's video today we're trying out a
full face of makeup from wish this is
not sponsored I waited two and a half
friggin months for this makeup to
finally come in the mail if you've never
heard of the wish app it's essentially
like eBay except a little bit sketchier
marketplace with a ton of different
sellers they have clothes random phone
cases tech stuff makeup they have pretty
much everything on there baby stuff
basically a bunch of cheap stuff from
China when I started thinking about
doing this video I went on Twitter to
see what you guys think of wish app here
are some of your responses by the way I
don't think I've ever had so many
replies to a tweet ever do you guys have
very strong feelings about wish the wish
app takes 10 years to ship but it's
pretty legit cheap chinese stuff
counterfeit products etc lots of things
you see on amazon you can get on wish
look at the reviews i use the ratings
filter i've never had a problem that way
which is the most annoying app ever
constantly sending you notifications
even when you turn them off i'm going
into this video knowing that there's a
bunch of counterfeit stuff we're not
gonna be getting real anastacio beverly
hills on here a real cover effects but
we're not shopping at Nordstrom here
we're shopping on wish we're gonna do a
full face of makeup see if there's
anything that's good I'm pretty sure
everything was under about eight bucks
definitely under 10 bucks most things
were closer to like the one dollar two
dollar range so as I was going through
on the app shopping purchasing things I
was making notes for a few things that I
noticed that I wanted to let you guys
know about first thing to be aware of is
that one there's obviously tons of
counterfeit fake makeup don't think
you're getting real name-brand stuff
it's definitely just a knockoff shipping
in most cases cost essentially the same
price as an item so an item might be
four dollars but then you have a
shipping cost that's also four dollars
so if you see an item for a couple bucks
just keep in mind that you're still
gonna have to be paying a couple dollars
on top of that something that I did not
like that I really like about se is that
Etsy has shipping bundles basically so
if you purchase multiple things from one
seller you typically get a discount they
don't give you any kind of shipping
discount even with the same seller so if
you purchase five things from the store
you're paying the same shipping cost
every single time at least that's what
happened with all of the merchants I
used you can find this on eBay and
Amazon too but there are a lot of the
same photos for completely different
items me
that the photo isn't actually the item
and a lot of the cases and just looking
at the packaging I definitely had
different expectations for what they
looked like on the app for some of these
things and what they look like in
reality it's the last thing is that I
placed my order on November 11th and you
get basically 500 million separate bags
that all came between I think the
quickest thing came in three weeks three
and a half weeks and the longest just
arrived which is why I'm making this
video right now two and a half months
later so this is an Amazon Prime one-day
shipping this is wish two-month shipping
so let's get into putting this stuff on
my face if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the bay
radio family and subscribe upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time I'm aware my lash extensions are in
a very janky state right now so this
first thing I have is this fora for
adieu me rosewater priming and setting
mist this is a rose water priming spray
I did try to pick things that had good
reviews has this like pink kind of
iridescent thing to it see how the
mister is Oh
a smells like bathroom cleaner I'm not
even gonna look at the ingredients in
here I'm scared okay oh it smells
horrible legit smells like chlorine or
bleach oh yeah it to bleach it smells
like bleach I'm sure this is just
fantastic for your skin as you guys know
derma Cole is one of my favorite
foundations derma coal 208 I have a
whole video on it I have tons of videos
on it has amazing coverage but there are
tons of fakes floating around on the
internet so I got this one and I want to
test it against my derma call to see if
this one is legit or if it's fake there
are a few ways that you can tell based
on the back of the bottle I believe
definitely fake I can tell already by
the packaging so here is the real derma
call as you can see the gold is a lot
lighter on this one if you look really
up close I'm not sure it will which
direction am I going the font is
actually a little bit different the fake
one also doesn't have to shade on the
back but I did order there 208 shade
off the bat I can tell you the
consistency of this is totally different
look at the one I squeezed out on the
pallet it doesn't move in real life it
looks very different when the shade is
completely different this one is
actually super light yeah this is much
more liquidy just putting my finger in
it this is gonna be way light BRB
okay we are back things are slightly
more under control so I can tell this is
gonna be way way way like it but I want
to do half half and just see the
difference in the formula I also got a
face powder so I'm hoping that that will
help kind of darken up my face and even
everything out this bunch I already
dampened this is obviously supposed to
be like the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge and this feels nice it
feels really soft really squishy does
feel really similar got bigger heads it
dampened so far so good so let's do the
real one on the right side of my face
with this sponge they don't usually use
a sponge with this foundation definitely
applies better with a brush but this
sponge feels super soft and it's nice
and squishy okay so let's go in with the
same sponge now with the other one
already using a ton more product and
much lighter coverage this one smells
like a lemon or something yeah what the
heck smells like lemon cake see if I can
build this up and see if it looks any
better with the brush definitely looking
a bit ghostly right now it's kind of
just like smearing around and then
disappearing just to salvage my face a
little bit I'm just adding a touch of
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous okay
so I got the pop feel HD concealer
invisible cover concealer pretty sure
this is supposed to be like the makeup
for everyone and then this is the focal
or I actually got a bunch of stuff from
this brand so this is the big cover
liquid concealer kind of want try both
maybe we'll do one eye with one one eye
with the other so I'm gonna squeeze some
of the big cover out for this side oh
that goes really far that looks pretty
good
see if it sets it kind of feels like
it's starting to set okay let's try the
invisible cover on the other side this
one looks like a peachy
I usually like more peach tone
concealers rather than yellow both of
them feel thin but really moisturizing I
got a bit better coverage on this side
and I like how this one is sitting on my
pores better this one totally just like
emphasized all of my pores in this area
before we go in with any face powders I
did get a liquid illuminator I never use
a liquid highlighter you don't want to
be putting it on top of powder because
just weird texture and stuff can happen
they're not even trying to hide it
there's obviously cover effects knock
off I think this was a few bucks it's
the custom enhancer it drops and I did
get the shade celestial weight this is
too good can we take a moment to
appreciate the spelling of custom Google
Translate proofreading so I do have the
real cover FX custom cover drops and the
same shade here both of these are in
celestial you can see the difference in
packaging so let's use the real guy on
this side of my face fake one on this
side I am not a big fan of liquid
illuminators in general I typically much
prefer powder but these are really
pretty I'm gonna set my under eyes and
everything so some of this might get
covered up but we can see how it looks
let's see what our quantum enhancer
drops look like much thicker this is
like glitter glue
smells like Oh blueberry or something I
mean I'm getting a major glow there
blend it out that actually looks pretty
good there is more visible glitter this
one is much more of like a reflective
but some of my nose this is the fake one
alright so moving on to face powder we
have some Mac Studio Fix thanks for
putting a tag right over here bro hit
the shade NC 20 because I believe that
was lightest when they had definitely
not Mac packaging this feels very cheap
like super light I'm gonna set my face
with this I forgot about the under eyes
that doesn't look bad got a nice Eiffel
Tower on there this is the major pressed
powder yeah this was definitely what I
was going for so this is a looks like a
light white yellow boot soft okay let's
do this for under the ice that under-eye
is looking pretty bomb I would totally
use that combo again that concealer with
that powder it looks pretty good it's
definitely isn't a
a translucent powder this does have a
white color to it kind of scared for
this I I'm gonna take the Mac Studio Fix
powder and just kind of blend that into
my face much prefer the concealer on
this eye but that powder out totally is
again have the focal life brow gel focal
or not where did I get focal life from
this is in the shade ash brown zero for
looks like dip brow I like the shade
it's not too warm not too grey doesn't
feel too pigmented but there's still
nice rich color to it let's see this
powder thing I have so many powders here
this is the hua mian Lee pearly pressed
powder so you get four highlight shades
in here now that I'm remembering I think
I actually was planning on using this
shade as a bronzer but let's go on with
blush first so I have two blushed shades
here this is again by the focal or this
is the shade b01 beaming that looks
pretty I just destroyed that box beaming
is this one Dollface is this one I'm
gonna go in with beaming pretty powdery
I'm getting a lot of kick up yeah I'm
gonna try the other shade Dollface I
feel like this is kind of just
disappearing it's like rubbing off
everything underneath it oh definitely
pass on the blush I see if I can use an
eyeshadow shade as a bronzer maybe who
that might work
these feel soft by the way so this is
the pop feel it definitely looks very
large online this is like a tiny ass
pellet I think I'm actually gonna try to
use this shade right here alright let's
see
okay that totally works so let's going
with the highlight shade now the powders
why is my hand twitching so much so I'm
gonna take the lightest shade up at the
top right there
after use quite a bit of product to get
this to show up I'm gonna try another
shade that one's not really well on me
let's try the pinkier one
this kind of looks like a blush topper
this highlight is a pass
besides my texture bed does it really
seem to be blending into my skin I have
two different eyeshadow palettes here
like I said the pop feel one this one is
called we care your favors the names on
these things are my favorite this is 0-1
bright luxe whoa we care your favors
look at this rose gold okay so this is
what these shadows look like it almost
looks like one of the food of beauty
palettes I'm not sure if it's supposed
to be I'm gonna do some swatches oh look
at that that was gold mine we're taking
some of the metallic shades I thought
they're gonna be super glittery but
they're like wet metallic ooh look at
that they feel very soft too like almost
melted I think I have to go in with that
one that's Dubai I don't know why I just
wash those on the inside of my hand but
there you go
dang there's some mats look a little bit
patchy but we'll see how they go on the
eyes I'm really excited to use those
metallic shades I might use the mats
from the pot feel because we have some
more cool tones in here and these ones
felt pretty nice I also got two other
shadows I think just in case these were
kind of duds these are the another from
FLIR Vieira Vieira packaging kind of
looks like color pop oh that's soft too
I just had a big chunk like fall off but
there you go
this one looks like it's a white gold
this might be pretty for the inner
corner oh that one looks a little bit
flaky that one's definitely a bit flaky
patchy that was one oh one cream and the
other one is 104 Nicole I'm gonna start
out with the sage salmon so I'm gonna
start out with the sage so I'm gonna
shut oh my god and by the way this
packaging is super cheap feeling I mean
it's like very lightweight bendy kind of
cardboard but let's see how the shadows
are I'm debating putting my usual Mac
Paint Pot down just so I can really see
I think I'm gonna do that because I want
to give the eyeshadows a fair test and I
used my Mac Paint Pot every single time
i prime my eyes oh okay blending out
beautifully I'm gonna take the shade
copper rose which is a matte kind of
more cool toned Brown in that same
palette and
that into the crease more by the way how
exciting is this brush it's been sitting
in my brush thing for like a year
because they don't want to ruin it but
literally all my brushes are dirty right
now again very pretty
I'm just kind of building up that shade
I think I want to dip into this palette
this that Brown right there and I'm just
deepening up the crease more with this
these are working great so far I am
impressed I'm gonna take that Dubai
shade on my finger oh my god these are
so nice feeling hell yeah that's a
gorgeous color almost has a bit of like
silver purple in there I'm just curious
what this looks like what even though
you really don't need to wet it okay my
card just got full literally as I put
that on but look at that here's without
wet here's with that that is so pretty
I'm excited we have a winner
try a couple more from this because I'm
not sure how I feel about this one yet
so I'm gonna use a flat edge brush and
going with this shade right here I'm
gonna press that against the lower lash
line alright now I'm gonna take this
shade in the corner and blend out the
lower lash line
super pigmented blended out good I need
a light inner corner shade I'm gonna try
this moonlight shade right here let's
see what this looks like
whoo that was kind of a dead might look
better on the eyes but it looks very
subtle that almost looks like it could
be a pretty face highlight though I'm
gonna add some of that moonlight shade
on my face there we go
get a little more something I might
actually try this shade on the inner
corner I really have another light
enough shade very yellow very yellow not
bad though this one is like a little bit
weird chunky I know if you guys can see
that texture but you get just kind of
like chunks in there do you see it like
flaking and falling down I wish I could
like do my eyeshadow again right now
because I really just want to keep
playing around with this thing I still
definitely want to play around the pot
feel one too because they are very soft
yeah like that one looks definitely
patchy here's two similar shades in the
folklore palette on the bottom versus
ones on the top tops definitely a bit
more patchy these are kind of more
smooth oh wow great swatches Taylor
great swatches this one says three
dollars and 40 cents for this palette of
course the shipping might be like 5
bucks still under 10 bucks for a palette
I think this one is worth it I'm into
this one too moving on to eyeliner I
have this one here I believe this is one
that got good reviews and it kind of
reminded me of my Physicians Formula
eye booster just the packaging and stuff
tiny little point on this thing not the
easiest to get like a smooth line as you
can see is kind of jagged II I think I
actually got a second eyeliner maybe you
did oh yeah I got this I also got a
magic eyeliner and seal eyeliner okay
wow this thing is big what the heck is a
seal eyeliner here's the eyeliner side
huge marker okay and then here's the
seal I it is like one of those stamp
things that scares me that might be a
whole other video I don't want to
totally ruin this whole look with this
but maybe I'll say this side actually
let's try this side so making the wing
was fine I actually got a really nice
fine point there but it's not the
blackest and it's not going
over the shimmer shade very well not
horrible just not super black don't
really think it's worth the money
actually got two periods of false lashes
because like I said bought these months
ago didn't know I was gonna have lash
extensions on but I'm really tempted to
put these on got number fourteen in
number eight so tempted to glue these on
but these would literally only be on for
like two minutes
well I filmed the rest of this video and
then they'd be off those look really
pretty though I'm definitely gonna use
these in another video oh yeah so this
is also what they do sometimes they'll
list them as free then you just pay for
shipping thing the shipping is three
dollars for that so three dollars a pair
not super super cheap in comparison to
some obey lashes but if they actually
our main clashes which I mean who knows
they feel pretty nice the band doesn't
feel too thick in the actual lash hairs
feel really soft they feel like nice
lashes I'm gonna stop myself and have
some self control so I'm just going to
put on some bottom lash mascara and get
the eye shadow off my lash extensions
and I'll be right back alright so I'm
not putting the bleach back on my face
so the last step is gonna be lips I got
three different liquid lipstick shades
here I don't remember getting a metallic
one but apparently I did these are all
the same ones magic halo definitely
gonna go in with the nude one right here
it looks like or almost this is the
long-lasting oh lame this is lip gloss
but says matte so I'm guessing this is a
matte liquid lipstick this looks like a
pretty shade very very stiff cheap
feeling applicator pretty shade though
whoa this smells like something really
familiar like someone's perfume that I
know mmm it smells good smells like a
perfume like very warm it definitely
feels very drying below like you know
those liquid lipsticks that give you
like this and tongue but it smells
really good
I'm getting whiffs of it as I'm talking
I don't know if that's a good thing or a
bad thing you might get a little
lightheaded
after a while I feel like if you were
kissing someone with this on they
probably pass out but it smells good
they should make this into a perfume the
shade is gorgeous yeah no transfer at
all I mean I would wear it again but I
probably would put something over this
oh that is all the makeup that I ordered
from wish I'm kind of impressed with a
few things I think obviously my number
one was
we carry your favors palette it's a
two-in-one it lifts your mood when you
read it and it's also a shadow feel like
it gave you kind of my full thoughts on
this but I think this one is worth it go
very beautiful metallic shades second
thing I would use again is the focal or
big cover concealer this under-eye it
looks pretty good right now I would
definitely use that again also with this
powder it's super soft has a nice
brightening effect to it this compared
to stargazer this one I would say is
much more creamy feeling not quite as
dry lashes I'm super excited to try
these look really nice band feels nice
the brow product folklore again that one
I really like the shade of this
definitely use that again I forget
anything I think those were all of the
raves out of the bunch the rejects were
pretty much all the other products I
tried I'm just gonna tell you the
biggest flops I feel like definitely the
setting spray would not recommend
putting that on your face I'm still
alive that's good really unenthused by
the folklore blushes also this highlight
palette I was expecting great things
from then obviously the derma cold dead
this is not the real deal definitely be
aware when you're purchasing on here
that nothing that looks like anything
that you're used to like if it looks
like another product it's definitely
replica it's not gonna be the legit
thing there's no way you can get a $25
product for two dollars the world
doesn't work like that
but overall would I shop on there again
for certain things yes I actually think
it was really fun trying out all this
stuff especially considering that I
found a handful of stuff that was decent
shopping experience and the whole
shipping and waiting I would give about
4 out of 10 definitely a lot of things
there that can be fixed and improved I
think but they are shipping from across
the world you order some things from
Amazon or Ebay that are coming from
China and other countries it usually
takes about three weeks I would say is a
long waiting time so to have some things
come to and a half months later that is
a little extreme that's a little
ridiculous but if you go in there
shopping knowing all of this stuff and
knowing not to expect what you would
expect with ordering on Sephora
for example or Ulta then I mean part of
the experience you know you're getting
like $1 items so if you enjoyed this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
