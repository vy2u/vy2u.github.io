work right now
all right so I have a giant box of
clothes here at Stram for you guys and
show you because I basically went online
thrifting my nose is itching foundation
itching strategies we're in the living
room this is different you guys know I
love a good thrift trip I just supposed
to a thrift haul actually recently so
I'll link that video over here in the is
you missed that one I think like 99% of
this stuff is kind of spring summer
clothes dresses shorts so all the pieces
I'm showing you guys today are from a
site called thread up which you haven't
heard of them it's basically an online
marketplace where you can buy secondhand
clothing that's basically brand new they
have so much stuff it is heaven they
have tons of brands on there you can
sort by brand they have adidas nike
actually got a lot of stuff from forever
21 you can sort by color size it
basically makes the whole experience 50
times easier don't get me wrong I love
walking into a thrift store and actually
thrifting too but this is just great if
you're on a mission for like a specific
piece you can also sell back to them
which is really cool actually went
through my whole closet and decluttered
and did the whole spring cleaning thing
that everyone is doing right now and I
showed you guys on snapchat this is back
when I just heard of thread up but you
can basically request a clean out kit
you just put all of your clothes shoes
kids stuff whatever you have into this
one bag send it back to them and
whatever they choose to sell online you
are in kind of a commission on you don't
have to take photos of anything you just
literally send the bag to them and they
do all the hard work so it's cool timing
besides discover thread up on my own I
think through Sam Sherman I saw like a
tweet she tweeted tweet cheese and then
they reach out to see if I wanted to
collaborate on the video so this video
is sponsored by thread up which I am
very excited for just ran out of breath
and show you guys some clothing so cool
timing love when things work out like
that they also hooked it up with a 40%
off discount code for you guys so if you
haven't purchased on there before check
the description box will be a link and a
discount code that will give you 40% off
your whole order let's jump into the
whole I am going to be trying on every
single piece just so you guys can see
kind of how I would wear it and what it
looks like on I want to show you guys
what the box looks like right when I got
it in the mail before I destroyed it
because I'm a sucker for packaging and
it was great so I just got my box in the
mail and I'm so freaking excited to open
this I wanted to show you guys what it
looks like because I love their
packaging
honey I remember what I ordered at this
point who is so exciting I'll give you
like a little style book or something
small about the leather jacket and
converse
so I got a ton of stuff so I pulled
up the pricing here on my order sheet
thing just I can tell you guys how much
each thing was first time I got is this
tan and black polka dot kind of crop top
Singh from hmm and I got this for $5.99
this fits really cute super stretchy
it's not faded or anything and that's
something I really appreciated all the
pieces I got the color is fully there so
I'd probably wear this with like a black
high-waisted kind of flowy skirt or
James and the clips you guys are saying
I paired it with these shorts which I
also got and these are from forever 21
and they're like a chiffon material and
they have really cute lacing on the
sides which is what I really liked I
don't know if these are the most
flattering things on my body but I
figured for a hot day or two even as
like a swim cover-up or something these
are cute and I like that it has a cinch
waist so it's not giving you any major
love handles or anything so they're just
super loose flowy comfy could also cute
dressed up probably with like with what
word was they even going for their
wedges and like a leather jacket white
chiffon tank top okay now I got a whole
outfit going I picked up another crop
top I usually only like crop tops if
they're short sleeve or like 3/4 sleeve
like this next one just because if I'm
going to be showing my midsection I just
like my arms a little bit more covered I
don't know I might just be me this is
also by forever 21 and this one was
$7.99 it is super freakin soft it's like
an off-white cream color with burgundy
actually liked it paired with the black
rip shorts so I love the neckline on
this it's like almost boat neck is this
boat neck which always looks really
flattering this one I feel like I could
wear in the fall or winter with like
high-waisted pants or tights and skirt
or something but also in the summer this
next top is what I'm wearing right now
before I forget to mention this one so
this top was actually the most expensive
piece I bought I've never heard of the
brand sanctuary but apparently it's a
good brand this one was $23.99 but I
really liked the pattern up here and I
thought it looked almost like free
people or like Urban Outfitters ease
which is why I kind of just splurge and
got this one it's also super light
weight which is really nice so like I
could tuck this one into shorts or also
wear it with jeans and it looks cute
just kind of flowy and hanging has this
nice opening in the front kind of with a
tie and then just detailing all up the
collar area also put the original prices
on the screen just so you guys can see
how much of discount it is so out of
everything I got there was actually only
one thing that really didn't fit so I
feel like I just got lucky the good
thing is that since there are so many
well-known brands on there you kind of
know your sizing usually in like forever
21 and H&amp;amp;M stuffs I should have known
that an hmm size 4 would not fit me I'm
usually like a 25 and pants but H&amp;amp;M
always runs super small I'm super bummed
because I love these I need to find
someone really tiny to give these to
because they're beautiful these are just
black frayed denim with like rhinestone
and stud kind of detailing on the sides
I freaking love these I can't even get
these over my butt so there's no even
attempting to try these on for you guys
but you can admire them here these were
only $5.99 also something that I really
appreciate on each piece they have the
little tag here for thread up which I
just feel like is a nice touch it just
makes it look more new than it is I
guess I should have a ton of H&amp;amp;M stuff
these are black leather shorts seasons
are size 4 but they fit me so I don't
know how much were these and these were
$8.99 these I like on me I don't know if
they're the most flattering but I liked
them so abruptly wear them they're
high-waisted black so leather shorts
obviously they have this cute quilting
kind of detail down the sides I like
these because they're baggy enough where
they're comfortable like I've tried a
bunch of different leather shorts on
they're always super tight and kind of
just tuck you in too much and these ones
are comfortable enough that you could
drink some beer in them have a good
night you know them saying and they're
not going to like suffocate you so the
top that I paired it with I also love
and this is from forever 21 I actually
think I might own this shirt in blue
this is short sleeve and it's kind of
crossed which I thought was really cute
I love pairing lacy kind of more
feminine things with like leather I just
love the whole edgy but still kind of
classic look and this one I think was
1199 it buttons up all the way and all
the way down in the back which I thought
was a cute touch right there I could go
get a ton of use out of this one in the
winter when it's colder it's like a
scarf and jeans also in the summer the
shorts is cute this next top I got is
also from forever 21 this one was $7.99
this looks new like I don't think this
has ever been washed and this is like a
see-through kind of mesh sheer striped
situation I definitely would wear a
bando underneath this if I was wearing
it out putting on a bando seems like a
lot of work right now but I love this
one I feel like I'll get a ton of use
out of
this would look really cute like Rick's
jeans and flats put over swimsuit as a
cover-up really feeling this one this
one is not the most summery but I've
actually been on the lookout for red and
black flannels for forever flannels are
always a really hit or miss for me
because of my shoulders are either too
broad or too tight so this one I feel
like fits pretty well this is by forever
21
this was $8.99 it's super soft comfy I
can wear it open and kind of more
slouchy I probably want to pair it with
that black striped shirt I would just
wear like a baggy white shirt underneath
or something or in the winter I can also
just button it up and wear that's like
an actual t-shirt I feel like I got
really lucky with these because they are
freaking made well I found made well
denim shorts on there these are so cute
they fit me perfectly they're a little
bit tight in the waist but that's okay
they fit Hugh everywhere else for size
reference these are made well size 25s
and I got these for $15.99 made well
$15.99 hell yeah like I don't have a
pair of shorts quite this color that's
what I'm telling myself because I've
bought like 10 pairs of shorts lately
it's like whenever you declutter and get
rid of the to the stuff I feel like
I can just shop and replace it all I
feel like it's better to just do that
and have pieces that you actually love
and are going to wear then have a ton of
clothes just sitting in your closet I
have no idea why I thought I needed this
I still don't know why I think I need
this but I do this is like a baggy shirt
that says Chicago for some reason
there's just a special place in my heart
for Chicago I feel like I'm going to
move there at some point let me know if
any of you guys live in Chicago I've
been there one time for a work trip a
couple years ago and I just kind of fell
in love with it but anyway is this the
kind of hideous but I really like it it
has a black and red roses on it it's
just more of like a baggy style probably
just wear this in the winter since it is
kind of thick but with leggings yoga
pants whatever this is the carbon brand
which I've never heard of and this was
$8.99 this skirt I love the color of
super vibrant kind of neon orange to the
Old Navy it's a little bit big this is a
size medium and in the waist it kind of
falls down a bit so I need to either
wear it with like a belt or get it
altered or something I think it works it
just sits a little bit lower than I like
flowy comfy I need to find a tighter
high waisted belt because the one I was
trying it on with definitely sat lower
on my hips too I usually wear that one
with shorts this one goes down kind of
rideable
my knees and this one was also $8.99
this dress is the softest thing I think
I own I want 10 of these so I can sleep
in them how is this this soft and this
is forever 21 forever 21 is not usually
this stuff so I don't know what's going
on
this is kind of like a purpley Mothe
dress I love this sleeve just really
come see slowly because one was $7.99
and this would look cute with like a
jean jacket - and just flip-flops
they have swimsuits on there I'm not
going to be trying this on for you guys
so this is a blindingly neon pink
swimsuit top by Victoria Secret and the
tag is actually still on here hell yeah
this was originally 38 50 I got this for
$13.99 new with tags $13.99 has this
cute scallop thing on the front and it
does have the underwire cups right here
Torey secret discontinued they're pretty
much all of the good swimsuits I think
everything accepts the pink lines which
sucks because they had such good
swimsuits so hopefully I can find
bottoms in this exact color I'll just
look it up online but it's not I'll just
wear with black bottoms or white bottoms
the last piece of clothing I got I got
one pair of shoes but the last dress
that I got is a spaghetti strap flowy
summery dress it's dark blue and white I
love the ruffle kind of trim on here in
the front and this looks really cute
with the jean jacket and I'm going to
press this with those white flip-flops I
hold in the target Hall like this will
be really cute for the summer and was
like a deep breath lip or even a lip I'm
wearing right now this I feel like looks
much more high-end than forever21
but it is again forever 21 this one
still has a tag on it
so it's originally 1990 and I got it for
$13.99 I need to iron this thing but it
also has really cute tassels on the
front which I love I'm Way too into
tassels right now so like I'm buying
everything with tassels even if it's the
most hideous thing in the world I will
buy it so the last thing that I picked
up are these Sam Edelman boots which I
am so in love with I feel like this was
such a score not only because there's
Sam Edelman but because they're size 4 I
have very small feet it's very hard to
find shoes that fit me Sam Edelman is
one of the few brands that makes cute
size for shoes and I was actually
shocked when I went on thredUP and saw
that they had a size 4 section those
kind of consignment shops whether it's
online
or in real life out in the world they
usually don't buy back size fours
because they don't sell enough so I was
so freakin excited to see that thredUP
has size fours on there so these are
beautiful they look like new they're the
soft kind of leather I don't have any
gray boots and actually need new boots
because mine are kind of wearing out
right now but do use if all the way down
the back and then they have this buckle
right here feel like they look a little
bit funky with the pants like reds and
whites with the holes right above the
knees so I definitely wouldn't wear
those with these pants I just had them
on to try on the shirt but I feel like
these will definitely get a ton of use
of them so that is everything that I got
I feel like I really scored so again
