going to be four hours of sleep last
night just got back from an 8 a.m.
business class don't know how I'm
functioning right now but we're gonna
make a video because you like my videos
always come out best when I'm like
delusionally tired I don't know if
that's a good thing or a bad thing but
we're gonna go with it before we get
into this raves and rejects video of
October I have very exciting news if you
follow me on Instagram or Twitter you
already know this but I did get a new
job at Mac and I am so excited I got the
freelance makeup artist position and I
am beyond excited let me know if you
want me to make a whole other video
about that process like interview
getting hired all that good stuff them
as of now I just signed the paperwork
yesterday so in a couple weeks I will
officially begin working at Mac update
number two this is what happens when you
film videos in a room by yourself
talking to yourself I began to hombre my
hair if you can see you've already seen
it if you follow me on Instagram I think
I'm gonna be adding a little bit more I
didn't document the process I think I
was just going to make a video telling
you about how I did it if you are
interested so comment down below if you
want a video on how to hombre die dark
hair let's get into the October raves
and rejects the first wave of the month
I cannot even begin to say how much I
love this candle it is the bath and body
Body Works mahogany teak wood oh Lord
it smells literally like you know those
men when you walk into an Abercrombie
store and you're like you are too
beautiful to be an actual human being
and I just want to smell you all day
that's what this candle smells like it
literally smells like a hot Abercrombie
man why wouldn't you want this candle is
my question next rave is the Ardell
adore lashes and these are these slowly
and alash 'as i've only seen these at
Sally's I like stocked up because I
scared that they were gonna sell out of
these I'm super picky with my lashes 120
demi whispies don't do it for me I feel
like they look like too long in it
they're just like all over and I feel
like I can't blink and weird things
happen these are short but very
voluminous these are kind of pricey
these were like I want to say like five
dollars I don't know try them if you
want next two things are lip product
this first lip product is actually brand
new I was just in the drugstore a couple
days ago and saw the whole display these
are the new revlon colorburst matte
balms and I wouldn't even call it a balm
this thing is like super pigmented and
it's not that moisturizing so I don't
know why it's a bomb but it is a
gorgeous gorgeous color it's super
purple
I will swatch it for you guys just a
matte lip pencil they're kind of copying
I feel like the L'Oreal mats or whatever
but do what you got to do Revlon you
know I want to go pick up some more of
these shades because I need to spend
more money on lip products that I'm
gonna use you know how often do you wear
a purple lipstick second lip product is
this NYX big and bold repulse n't never
knew that was a word plumping lip gloss
definitely think I was reading the
French thing I actually got this in a in
the influenster voxbox or whatever it's
called that free box where they send out
with the samples and look at how
freaking ginormous this stick is can we
just can we just observe that bigger is
not always better but in this case my
friends it is stuff is awesome I don't
even like lip glosses I rarely wear lip
glosses this is a very faint glossy
finish
it doesn't look pink and shiny like it
looks in the tube it just gives you like
a natural gloss kind looks like you're
wearing like shiny chapsticks is in the
shade pleasantly plump pink by the way
the next two things are hair products
did a whole other video on this I don't
know why but my last two videos I
uploaded never went into subscription
boxes so that
awesome they have like a super low view
count because you guys didn't see them
so check my recent videos I don't know
why they didn't show what but I do have
two new videos one is a tutorial review
on this curling wand and the other one
is a video where I show you how to paint
your furniture so check those out that
was a side note now I'm moving on the
first thing is this shine spray it is
thermal shine for silky-smooth and the
heat protectant use the flat iron our
hairdryer whatever I got this from flat
iron experts calm this is the best shine
spray I have ever used in my life not
only because it smells like smells like
it should be this candles sibling oh my
god so once you leave your room if you
still want to you know keep the
Abercrombie boy thing going just spray
this in your hair and you will smell I
just squirted it into my hand to rub it
through the ends of my hair keeps your
hair looking healthy I think this is
like $11 somewhere around there and
check the video because I have all the
info for this stuff mentioned in the
video the second thing is this cortex 4
and 1 curling wand and this has 4
different like heads that you can rotate
out this is the biggest one I think this
is one inch might be bigger than one
inch I'm not sure this is amazing if you
want like the big loose Kim Kardashian
waves that's what I've been using almost
everyday not today I curled it with a
straightener today if you're wondering
but what's awesome about this is not
only it has the four different heads but
it shows you like as it's getting hot I
don't know why I think that's so cool
but it literally heats up in like 10
seconds and you can see the degrees like
go up I think that's really cool the
last rave of the month this is extremely
random about a heavier green this is
organic baby spinach I have been
obsessed with spinach this month I don't
know what it is
you can just literally do so many things
with spinach it's so healthy for you it
tastes good what I've been doing is
everyday I'll just put a huge pile of
this like literally half the bag in the
pan saute it with some olive oil and put
garlic salt on it and it tastes amazing
and I'm
like a crave spinach now if you're
looking for like an easy healthy
vegetable to eat can't go wrong with
this I only have two rejects this month
the first one is not actually you know
physically here with us today because it
has already been disposed of because
that's how much I didn't like it but it
is the Trader Joe's cookie butter I
don't understand what the fucking big
deal is with the cookie butter people I
really don't it tastes like mushed up
graham cracker I don't know people are
like flippant it's about this cookie
butter so I had to go out and pick it up
I wanted to like it I tried really hard
to like it I tried it in various
different forms and I don't understand
that sounds good right to see thing ii
reject of the month is the hard candy
glamoflauge concealer this isn't a
complete reject because on one hand i
actually like how it looks in the
coverage but at the same time it creases
and just gets very dry and weird
consistency i don't know if it's just me
let me know your thoughts on this
because maybe I just need a better
setting powder with it not quite sure
that was my October raves and rejects
let me know what your raves and rejects
were for the month and buy that candle
seriously you got to do it first check
keep just balling I know I've said for
like 5000 years that I'm getting my room
tore up I think it's happening today I
just have to clean my room I think
that's it delusional I'm gonna go take a
nap watch some Grey's Anatomy smell some
boy candles have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
