and rejects I'm pretty sure I just
filmed my September raves and rejects
like ten days ago but no idea how it's
almost Halloween no words the Sun is
doing weird things right now so I'm like
jammed in the corner of this tiny s room
and I have my leopard Snuggie on Bella
have some exciting things to share with
you guys this month and I do have a
giveaway at the end of the video so make
sure you stick around for that we can
also check the down bar because all the
giveaway information will be listed down
below right on my teeth yet no hair in
my mouth
alright so I'm gonna start out with the
makeup brushes have been loving this
month I got these Sedona lace vortex
brush set which basically comes with a
 ton of brushes I'm pretty sure
there's every kind of brush you would
ever need in here basically look at this
one like this you should just frame or
nothing else
I haven't gotten around to trying every
single brush yet so I'm just gonna be
mentioning two brushes today
what the heck son there's gonna be
mentioning two brushes today because
these other ones that I've been obsessed
with the last couple weeks the first one
is the Sedona lace FBO 7 foundation
brush you guys know I love my Sigma f80
and Sigma f ed2 foundation brushes this
one is like a whole new level I haven't
tried this with like normal liquid
foundation yet but I've been using it
with my Maybelline Dream under
foundation every single day is what I'm
wearing right now if it was possible to
make this foundation look more air brush
this brush doesn't so soft I really like
it because it doesn't really clump or
settle in the brush bristles as much as
the Sigma one does at least with my
foundations if you're on the hunt for a
good foundation brush I highly recommend
this I think Sedona lace is 20% off
right now I think they still have that
going on I'll leave it down below if
you're interested you need this in your
life the other brush is the FBO 3 and
this is just a tapered powder brush I
use this for under my eyes for setting
my eye concealer you could use this as a
contour you could use this as blush this
is like a multi
this brush I think I haven't tried
Sigma's tapered brush yet so I can't say
how they compare but so far I'm super
happy with the quality of the Sedona
nice brushes I think powder just like
flew everywhere let me know down below
you guys are team Sigma or Sedona lace
I'm curious
alright so the next thing is the
Neutrogena rapid clear foaming face
scrub I use this probably three or four
months ago and I just finish it never
got around to are you purchasing it I
kind of like branched out with different
face washes I decided to go back to this
because I feel like whenever I'm not on
yuichi Gina that my skin gets worse I
don't know if that she's like a placebo
thing like I'm thinking that but I went
back to using this stuff and I swear to
god within week my skin was so much
better than it has been for the last
month and a half basically I never
really think that face washes make a
difference because it's like how much
can I actually do in the 15 seconds
that's on your face I've been using this
morning and night when I do it at night
I don't get my face as wet because I
want the exfoliator to really like work
in there and I kind of leave it on for a
good 30 seconds as is dripping
everywhere all right I wanted to show
her if you struggle with acne I would
definitely recommend that you try to
step out it's like six dollars from the
drugstore so can't go wrong can you put
this like in a bucket next we have a
perfume obviously if you saw my
September waves in rejects video I
mentioned the guest seductive perfume I
think is called seductive the guest
perfume I've been kind of switching it
up between that and the Burberry brick
perfume this smells so good again it's
kind of like and never used to go for
these type of scents I don't even know
how you describe this it just reminds me
of like an older woman
that sounds so odd but like that's what
it smells like I feel like this is also
a really nice work perfume again I don't
know what if I would wear this going out
to the club but for work it's really
nice I got this for super cheap off of
fragrance net I'll leave the link down
below I might have a coupon code I can't
remember I think this was like $30 and
it's originally 70 or 60 somewhere
around there they have a crazy
discounted prices on there I also got
the glam glow mask first super cheap I
don't know
check them out they have like make up in
a bunch of the random stuff to which I
didn't know they had the concealer I've
been using this month is the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer I finally
finished my Revlon age defying concealer
or whatever it's called dark spot
concealer corrector finally finished
that one so I figured before I went out
and bought a new concealer I should
probably use up the 15 that I have
sitting in my drawer right there I do
really like this one it's quick it's
easy I don't mix anything in with it to
lighten it I do think that the
Physicians Formula correcting powder I
always talk about that helps a lot to
lighten up the under-eye even if my
concealer is a little bit too dark some
things is like light enough if you have
super fair skin but it works and it's
just quick and easy in the morning and
I've been really liking it last makeup
product I have this month it's really
random this is a rock and Republic lip
gloss this is in the shade tyrant I'm
wearing this right now and I was not
expecting to like this I didn't even
know rock and Republic made makeup
aren't they a jeans thing I think
they're I got this off of glam bought
first super marked out and I was on
there they were having like an
additional sale on top of their own
markdown prices so this is like crazy
cheap I think I got it for like seven or
eight dollars this is really more like a
liquid lipstick to me I really like that
it has the glossiness to it because be
like I have a lot of liquid lipsticks
that are matte I don't really have any
that are super pigmented
and have the gloss going on this color
is just a perfect fall red that isn't
like too in your face red it's also
great because if you want to tone it
down it's super easy to make it not look
as red if you just put a thin layer on
it's totally wearable for work this
gives you some nice color to your lips
and I really love these kind of muted
red rosy tones as you guys know then I
have some shoes someone commented on my
last week's and rejects saying that I
should start doing other things besides
makeup and things like that so I decided
I would include my fashion rape of the
month these are just zip up boots I got
off of hot lip these are actually in the
kit section yes they're like midget
sized that's what I am kids shoes are
already cheaper and then on hot lip they
were like basically free I think these
were like 17 dollars off the pot luck so
score what I really like is
if you order shoes on hot look you can
return them to the north shamrock store
so you don't have to worry about
shipping the back you can literally just
bring them in and they'll change it or
return it whatever I just really like
wearing these with like leggings and
flannel or whatever I'm wearing and wear
these pretty much every day last thing
which I am super excited about and the
box is completely wet from the new to
new face wash I have my bean box right
here if you follow me on twitter which
is the same as my youtube name couple
weeks ago I was obsessing about the bean
box this is a startup in Seattle is a
coffee delivery service basically like
epsy or birch box for one two five
thousand delivery boxes everyone's
obsessed with right now except its
coffee like this isn't actual useful box
people I totally don't feel guilty
spending $20 a month on coffee because
it's something that you would buy
anyways some just show you it I'm
getting too excited so when you open it
they have this super cute stamp on the
inside that says roasted with love in
Seattle when I open it on the front
there was a card from Matt the CEO I
thought this was super cool the whole
bean box team has been really awesome to
work with I really love that in a
company win like the CEO the founder
whatever actually talks to you it's kind
of refreshing so then they give you this
card that tells you all about the coffee
and the different Roasters and how to
brew it and all that stuff they give you
little coffee samples of a bunch of
different kinds of coffee I still one in
the kitchen right now that I haven't
tried yet but I obviously tried all
these they come as the coffee beans not
brown so you do need like a mr. coffee
grinder or whatever they're super cheap
they're like 10 bucks so if you're a
coffee person this is literally gonna be
your new best friend this is amazing you
get to sample a bunch of different kinds
of coffee if you love it you can order a
full bag on their website I'm just super
stoked on this and I think this is such
a great idea like why has no one done
this before I did think that the bags
were gonna be a little bit bigger than
they are
I made my coffee super strong so one of
the
was one pot of coffee for me I think
that's just me though like I put a ton
of coffee if you're a coffee addicts
like myself I definitely think this is
worth $20 a month I super appreciate the
customer service bean box was awesome
enough to host a giveaway for you guys
they're giving you guys some free coffee
so if you want to enter to win a free
three-month subscription from bean box
all you have to do is follow them on
Twitter follow me on Twitter and leave a
comment down below telling me what your
favorite kind of coffee is a giveaway
will run for two weeks so be sure to
check the down bar for all the specific
information on how to enter and when
ends and things like that I actually
remembered my rejects for the month I
think this is the first time in like two
months that I've actually remembered to
mention that my rejects I only have one
this is a Maybelline colossal volume
express mascara I really like the
packaging where is this end it was
appealing to me the outside packaging
made it look like the brush was similar
to Maybelline falsies I'm really all
about the curved brush and this is
curved the bristles are just like way
too stiff and way too small and it just
didn't really do anything for me I feel
like it didn't really like get into my
lashes and give me volume at all if
anything I think this is like more of a
separating mascara it does have a good
comb if that's what you're going for but
if you're someone like me who likes a
 ton of volume this mascara is not
for you
so that was October Reis and rejects I
hope you guys have an awesome Halloween
if you don't know what to be yet you can
always watch this pinup makeup tutorial
just saying I love you guys thanks for
watching and see you in my next video
