tell him who's boss
all right so today we're doing a full
face of first impressions to say makeup
was a struggle today is an
understatement there were lots of
interesting products in today's video a
few hits
lots of not so hits so if you guys are
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the baby Rito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
this Bobbi Brown vitamin-rich base base
I got during the 15 percent off sale
because I've heard so many cool raping
about this lately it smells very like it
smells like a lemon dessert or something
to me melts into your skin really nicely
makes your skin feel moisturize but
still soft and like a good base but I
haven't been in love with it I'll update
you guys but right now I'm not feeling
like it's totally worth the money
a couple primers that I want to put on
this is the Smashbox reduce redness
which I haven't tried and then this is
the new Smashbox lotta metal pedal okay
peddle metal primer I am kind of
confused by this I don't know if this is
just like a radiance primer or if it's
gonna be like more of a liquid
highlighter type of thing I'm just gonna
apply this to kind of like the high
points of my face first just to see it
feels like a liquid highlighter more
than a primer feels pretty thick I'm
gonna put the reduce redness one on the
rest of my face I think so and I'm
filming this I just got back from LA yet
was that yesterday two days ago and then
my mom and grandma are in town right now
for a whole week which is super-fun
but that's why I'm filming right now at
like 7 a.m. but yeah so it's been like
complete non-stop I've had a lot of
videos pre filmed this feels definitely
like a silicon primer so hopefully this
doesn't break me out but feels thin okay
but is there any green when you actually
blend this out it doesn't look like it's
doing anything for my redness because
there's no green I have this revolution
Pro under eye primer it says hydrate my
under eyes can get very greasy very dry
feels like a super just thin kind of eye
cream it is absorbing though my face is
feeling very dry right now
after that primer so I think I'm
actually gonna spray some of my Too
Faced hangover this is what I use always
if I just need some extra moisture /
everyday I love this I don't use this
since I've had dry skin my foundation
looks so much crappy so makeup
revolution came out
this new stick foundation fast base
stick foundation this is in the shade f1
let's just go Oh glides on nice Sigma
f80 - is one of my favorite brushes to
blend out stick foundations because it's
super compact and ooh
Wow good coverage ends blending it out
really easily feels like kind of buttery
elf also makes really nice brush for
stick foundations I'll put both of them
down below oh that looked a lot better
from far away so up close it's not
looking the best around this whole area
like the center of my face it's looking
okay over here I do like how easily this
blends out for a stick foundation
doesn't feel like one that has it time
to drag I like that it has a bit of glow
it's just not looking the best I'm gonna
try and build it up I wouldn't say this
is full coverage off of one go
definitely don't love it but also don't
hate it so I picked up the Kylie
cosmetics skin concealer because in the
concealers video when I was talking
about the Kim kkkw what's called my
struggling with this the k'kaw concealer
which I actually still have been using
every single day mixed in with the
flower beauty and those two combined
have been like great for my under eyes
and a bunch of you in that video said
that you were kind of like skeptical
about the whole Kylie cosmetics thing
too but the Kylie concealer a lot of you
apparently really like more in see how
it is this isn't the lightest shade
because I was reading that it actually
goes really really fair this is the
shade she'll hopefully it doesn't dry as
fast as the k'kaw I probably should have
done one eye at a time here oh is it
questions about this brush this is the
morphe g 38 I love it for under-eye
concealers what I typically use it for
but you can also put on eye primer with
this spot conceal it's just the only
brush I found that applies my under eye
concealer well and like doesn't take
away the coverage that's definitely not
looking as full coverage as the k'kaw
one right now and it looks more
moisturizing the k'kaw one is definitely
more matte and try sponge on this side
obviously it's not really covering the
darkness right there my under eyes
that's not looking very full coverage
and try and build this up a little bit
to get more coverage I don't like either
the brush or the sponge side since this
is the second layer music
spend Greece in a lot okay not liking
this definitely like the kqw one a lot
more looking a lot better on camera in
real life I can see like my bags and
darkness totally coming through this
does feel kind of like it's gonna slide
around it feels actually really similar
to the Maybelline fit me doing smooth if
you don't set it I've been really
excited to try this new powder by
hourglass this is their veiled
translucent setting powder really cool
packaging it has this like Basin thing
here get it out like this tell him who's
boss my nose looks like C's over
here looks decent I almost feel like
this has a little bit of a glow to it
you don't think it's just the foundation
coming through I feel like when I put
that on I saw a little bit I'm actually
kind of confused about this thing
because you have to like tap it back
into here after you flip it it doesn't
seem to be one of those translucent
powders that's taking away a ton of the
coverage so that's good that's pretty
rare I think if I had a foundation
underneath that I liked this one could
have potential I don't know if I'm going
to set right on the center because I
think that might just look a little bit
worse but I'm gonna do my temples I'm
getting so much creasing with this
concealer this is the revolution Pro
Micro bleeding effect brow pencil and
dark brown this is really tiny
I'm excited oh I definitely thought this
was gonna be like a pen it's a little
little tiny eyebrow pencil pencil isn't
quite my shade it looks too light and a
little bit too warm I don't think this
is quite dark brown looks more like a
medium brown shade i have another breath
i'm sure do i do okay this one's by
flower beauty and it's the brow tattoo
had two effects stain i'm gonna try this
one oh god are these colors also like
this is supposed to be espresso when I
kind of like feather up in the front but
this looks pretty red I don't mind the
actual product but the color it just
looks a nowhere near espresso but okay
what the actual heck this is one of
those makeup days I can tell okay I'm
gonna go in with my normal brow products
and I'll be right back and I feel like
washing off my whole face right now this
is what happens when you try and film
while you're sleep-deprived those brows
just took me about an hour to salvage
2019 so this eyeprimer is new to me but
I've used it a few times so far is the
revolution Pro I elements core eye
primer Spacely supposed to be like the
Mac Paint Pot which you guys know is
like my holy grail eye primer and this
one I don't like as much it's a little
bit too creamy mac paint pot is a little
bit drier which I feel like is a little
bit better for eyeshadow because it's
just not gonna like crease and stuff
it's not bad I just would definitely
recommend still the Mac Paint Pot over
this one sorry I know everyone's pet
peeve is foundation on black hair okay
so this bronzer I feel like I've tried
before but I also feel like it was a
different shade but this is in the shade
Sunkist is the Urban Decay beach bronzer
this shade looks different than the one
I remember if I am wearing a warm
bronzer a rather habit whoops I'd rather
have it be kind of a reddish tone rather
than orange with a powder brush for
blush I'm going to try this new morphe 8
w or master palette pretty sure I've
used the shade sweet before don't
remember what I thought of this so this
is like a whole new first impression I
think I'm actually gonna mix the shade
sweet with babe right next to it to give
it a little bit of a glow and I've been
loving this brush just by AOA
it's the f21 this was one dollar it's a
bomb it's good for blush but also just
to kind of blend everything together
this isn't gonna give you like the most
intense payoff with the blush because it
is more of a flimsy brush like I usually
use something like where's my brush
actually the same brush I just use for
bronzer I think that's the first thing
that's on my face today that I actually
like I'm gonna take this powder I've
been trying out this is the Smashbox
thier halo hydrating perfecting powder
and I'm just gonna blend over my cheek
area because my face just need some help
I'm sure how I feel about this powder so
far I've only used it like in this area
of my face I'm gonna try as an all-over
powder soon and see everything is
looking pretty patchy on top of this
foundation right now alright I'm really
hoping that these are balm and they
don't fail me because I am obsessed with
the packaging of these I think this is
the most beautiful packaging I've seen
in a while from a collection this is the
Smashbox blotter
highlighters and I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna go in with this one looks like a
kind of champagne
look how frigging pretty that is the
rose and print on there the shade is so
interesting
it actually looks so much more like pink
and dark in real life I'm gonna swatch
this oh whoa this actually looks like
the hood of BD eyeshadow it feels like a
drier formula and I'm definitely dipping
in a few times you get it to really show
up this one might have just kind of like
a scratchier top layer on here Wow Wow
my skin looks so good right now I like
more subtle highlights oh I'm enjoying
how this looks it just feels like it's
definitely a drier kind of texture
oh wait totally forgot I also had this
afterglow palette by urban decay i might
actually layer oh there's blush in here
too anna bronzer that one looks pretty
okay I might actually layer sin oh it's
pretty yeah I want to layer sin whoa
there we go there's a highlight for you
this is much more of an intense
highlight if that's what you're looking
for no idea what kind of eye look I'm
gonna go for today but I wanna try out
this Nicole Concilio violet boss eyes
shadow palette I actually got this on
hot look which you guys know I'm
obsessed with for Half Price
honestly I got this for like 20 bucks
around there here's the colors looks
super pretty
we start out with the shade Daisy which
is this tan kind of transition color I
don't think I've ever tried
violet vos eyeshadows I don't know why
I've had one in my Sephora cart for
forever I've been thinking about doing
an updated what's in my Sephora cart
kind of thing I did a video on that a
long time ago products that just chill
my cart and I never actually buy but
they're just in there alright the eyes
really need to happen for us today this
shade is really speaking to me palm tree
looks like a really pretty greenish one
I couldn't wanna let's use that oh this
looks exactly like a Mac what's a color
that one pigment that's really pretty
feels really buttery and smooth I love
how there's a shade in here called
hangry hell yeah I think I'm gonna take
this shade right here boop bop it's
called we're just blending that into the
crease oh this is like that camel shade
I always loved I like how these are
pigmented and they feel bit powdery but
they're still sticky
that's like my one thing with powdery
eyeshadows I hate when they just kind of
like blend away that shade is so pretty
that shade is like I could use that
every day I'm gonna go back in with palm
tree on my finger for my inner corner
I'm going in with a mix of LA and
Victoria the two kind of gold shades oh
there's also Zozo
this might be too dark we'll see I think
Zozo this lighter gold shade so I'm
going to take from my inner corner I'm
gonna wet it I'll quite light enough for
my inner corner the only other shade
this lighter is NYC which actually looks
like kind of purple it's like a white
but has like a purple blue do Chrome so
I think I'm actually gonna take my face
highlighter and just pop that on the
inner corner I'm gonna take the Urban
Decay sin again there we go actually it
is pretty I'm gonna go back in with boo
pop that like camel shade and blend that
down here on a flat edge liner brush I'm
gonna take chocolate
I'm just running this right to meet kind
of the gold another pretty Brown I'm
feeling the Browns in this thing this is
actually a rose gold liner this is also
from the Lada Club and this I think
actually might look really cool right
now with this kind of green you probably
use this as like an all-over lid shade
it doesn't seem like it's totally gonna
show up if I try and like wing it so I'm
just gonna bring it out a bit and I am
gonna use false lashes today so it
probably looked really pretty on top of
like a full matte eye
like I said I'm gonna put on falsies but
I want to try this covergirl peacock
flare mascara and it has this almost
like twisted wand what is this reminding
me of some kind of candy well this is a
dry mascara feels a little bit dry for
what I usually like but that is super
lengthening look at that actually that
gave me great length this might be a
good layering one on its own it's not
giving me as much volume as a usually
like and it does feel pretty dry I think
I'm gonna use these lashes I'm gonna
have the exact ones down below because I
just have them in this thing so I don't
know what they are off the top of my
head but it was from another video so
link these down below alright so my eye
makeup took a little unexpected turn I
put on my lashes was trying to cover up
the lash band and then it turned into a
full-blown
winged liner so I'm gonna do a nude lip
today I have three new products I want
to try this is the LA girl perfect
precision lip liner this is in the
shade flesh and I'm supposed to be
picking up my mom right now oh it looks
very peachy oh hey girl makes some good
lip liners I love their retractable ones
I'm gonna try out this pop beauty liquid
lipstick this is in the shade pale baby
ooh this looks pretty okay this smells
like fluoride bubble gum fluoride oh my
god like actually getting the chills
right now I don't mind the dentist at
all but fluoride I'm not down for I
think this is supposed to be like mint
bubblegum scented but if you don't like
the dentist this will give you PTSD
pretty color though why am I having so
many issues today doing like basic I
 the formula feels really
comfortable if it didn't smell like a
dental office oh I really like that
shade actually I don't even think I want
to put this on I was gonna put the Becca
Glo gloss over top mmm this just smells
like straight-up mint so that's
everything Wow there were a ton of
misses today it's gonna go through the
few products that I somewhat liked
because all the rest were pretty much
rejects totally feeling this palette the
formula of these are right up my alley
shades I used I'm definitely into this I
really like the shade of I like how it
feels comfortable you know how I feel
that scent eyebrow products face
products pretty much everything besides
my eyes and lips and highlight I would
probably pass on but I would try out
this hourglass veil powder again like I
said it didn't seem to totally remove my
makeup underneath which is rare and I
think it actually gave a little bit of I
don't wanna say glow but kind of like a
sheen how do I already have hair stuck
to this lots of rejects today but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video even though
I'm like pretty much sleep-deprived and
I don't even know what it did on my face
today but if you enjoyed this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up I
have everything that I used on my face
linked down below in the description box
