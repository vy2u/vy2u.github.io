lioness great now I haven't filmed a
leopard girl vlog in a long-ass time it
feels like so I thought today is the day
I'm doing anything too exciting I'm
going to Hobby Lobby like every time I
film a leopard or a blog I go to Hobby
Lobby yeah when I actually have a day
off like that's what I do I found a
piece of furniture outside that I'm
gonna be repainting I just want to show
you what's on the pace today I've been
obsessed with mixing Estee Lauder Double
Wear with Revlon Colorstay I'm gonna
shade one c1 but this is a little bit
dark which is part of the reason why I
mix it in with Revlon I literally do not
powder my face and it stays on all day
this is the only foundation in
combination I've ever found where I
don't need to powder this is what I do
when they take an Instagram picture by
the way I just put a white piece of
paper on my desk because it's a little
dirty so Kate from Friday night
highlight made a whole video on how she
does her winged liner with gel and I
have never been a gel liner person I
just I don't know if it was a brush I
was using or what but I've just never
gotten it to work for me and I did it
her way today and I kind of love it like
look at that wing look at that point I
used the Maybelline eye studio gel liner
which I've had sitting in my drawer for
literally two years and it wasn't dried
out which was awesome but I think the
key to it is the brush this is the
Milani little brush that comes with
their eyeliners only know with what they
are there these blondie fierce foil
eyeliner these are new in stores
seriously buy this just for the brush if
you want to do easy gel liner before I'm
trying to use like the flimsy ass
brushes like these where can you see
before I was using this kind of brush
and it just did not work for me at all
to do a wing this is a lifesaver this is
my baby that I found sitting outside by
the trash like who would throw this away
so I'm basically gonna paint it like a
light gray color and then put crystal
knobs on it one of the drawers is
missing like hardware it's missing the
little slighty thing so I think what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna unscrew this
bottom part and so it's just gonna be
one drawer and then like a little
nightstand thing I'm a whole video on
how I paint my furniture but this stuff
is a lifesaver you need some kind of no
Sienna primer
I'll link the video right here where I
talk about painting furniture I painted
this yellow thing that video was I think
my most popular video to date how to
paint your furniture which is so random
you never know I think we got to do
something with the hair the straightener
I used to curl my hair is this guy it is
freaking amazing this is by Bombay hair
and I'll leave like the model or
whatever down below this is amazing to
curl your hair if you like to use a
straightener I don't do curling irons
they just don't work for me it's the
easiest thing ever to curl the only
thing which I do want to warn you about
is that it's peeling like the plastic is
peeling right here I don't know if you
could to see that and I actually emailed
Bombay asking if that was normal or what
was up with that and she said that it's
normal which seems kind of strange to me
like like you should change that but if
that doesn't bother you it's a really
awesome straightener and I love it
before and after hair is done on the
lips is jordanna's modern matte in matte
blush I've been switching between this
lipstick and revlon matte naked every
single day these have been my favorites
this month just such a pretty color and
these feels super nice on your lips
trying to find a good light gray pink
color it's kind of ironic because I'm
seeing 50 shades of grey tonight Liz
Marie Galvan is one of my favorite at
home DIY bloggers her style is literally
exactly how I want my house to look and
I think she has a lot of great painting
so I'm trying to find the search bar
where are you
alright we have arrived at the happiest
place on earth
alright it made it out of Hobby Lobby
and under two hours that's how you know
it was a success so I think I got what I
needed where should i how do i hold you
guys right now ended up getting chalk
pain because you don't have to prime it
so it's like a whole two hours saved
basically and this is the Americana
decor chalky finish paint and this is in
the color
I always once a shade from doing they
cut primitive I think that's the shade
this was the last one that they had of
this color so I hope that this is enough
paint this was nine dollars and then I
got two paintbrushes i usually use foam
brushes to paint furniture cuz i need to
clean it and it's just like less of a
hassle but I figured I would try these
they were like two bucks for two of them
and then I got the hardware that I'm
gonna be putting on which is just like
this mirrored thing they had tons of
different weird ones I've literally
stood there for like ten minutes just
trying to choose but I went with this
one and then they had all Valentine's
Day so sixty something percent off so I
got a heart mason jar because I thought
this was adorable and I'm just gonna
unscrew this weird top thing and just
you said that the cup whenever there's
men walking into Hobby Lobby by
themselves I kind of just one asked to
marry them it is sunny right now what is
happening in Seattle I think I'm getting
sunburned right now
painting and watching the scandal my
toes are obnoxious Leaney on right now
these are officially my painting pants
and about putting together in my class
card
aka my makeup cart and I'm so excited I
got this off of Amazon I'll have the
link down below if you guys wanna check
out yourself
it looks nice because there's these
small drawers but are kind of somewhere
to like the IKEA Alex Nigel thing
alright so I just put together this
craft cart from Amazon and I think it's
actually perfect I don't know if you
guys can see but this is where I usually
film this is super freakin messy right
now but this is where I film in this
room is like the tiniest thing you've
ever seen in your entire life
so this actually fits perfectly in here
and I actually can see my now I'm
kind of starting to organize it so I can
actually see all the makeup and stuff
that I have and I actually have a drawer
for empties now so they're not just
sitting on the corner on my floor got
the leopard robe on I think we're gonna
call tonight so this was a super short
blog I don't even know how long this is
gonna be I wanted to make another one
these because you guys really like them
I'm gonna go watch 50 shades of grey
with my roommate and get ready so I'm
gonna go if you like this video and you
