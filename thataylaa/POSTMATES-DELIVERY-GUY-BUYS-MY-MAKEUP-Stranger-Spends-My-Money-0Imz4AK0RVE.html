chiropractor looking slightly ratchet
but I'm super excited for this video as
you can see I'm going to be having my
post mate buy a full thing to make up
for me and I'm going to do a full face
wearing all the makeup that they pick
out so it's all Gen X 10 do a video
where she had her post mates just get
random stuff from Target for her so I'm
reeling her video down below so you guys
can go check it out I haven't seen
anyone do a post me spike my make that
video yet I'm super curious to see how
this goes for those of you who don't
know or are new here post mates is my
life basically like a delivery service
they do food they'll deliver dry
cleaning bill literally do anything this
is very fitting hell yeah we got a guy
he looks pretty legit his name is Jordan
tempting to block out my address here
but here's Jordan looks like a nice
fella having him go to CVS he has a nice
selection there yes almost 5 stars looks
young look tips looks with the times
we'll see if he knows how to pick out
makeup so if you guys are excited for
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up I just texted my post mate
squeeze your thumbs
okay you just responded I'm excited I
think is going to do a good job
I believe in you Jordan you got this
okay I just got a notification that I
use on the way which is slightly
concerning because I think you literally
did that in about 18 minutes I can't
even pick out foundation in 18 minutes
so I don't know how to do got a full
face of makeup update I'm waiting for
him to open the door got scam on
following him on the map and keeps like
circling the building I don't really
know what's going on where you at Jordan
hi small bags is powerful safe a big
bald Honda's other stuff I asked like
the people in area yeah
they head into games of course alright
here's Jordan suppose wait how confident
are you confident pretty heavy small
bags so I think get it okay
you don't figured out okay thank you so
much have a good one alright u.s.
elephant this is a tiny bag I'm like
slightly concerned but there's a lot of
stuff in here I took a piece but I
haven't looked at everything I do see
foundation so that's good let's go see
what he got by the way I can't remember
if I said in the car but I gave him a
$150 spending limit and I looked at the
post mates receipt and he spent one
hundred fifty four dollars so good job
Jordan let's see what $150 at the
drugstore got us I wash my face but I
haven't primed it or anything as they
don't have a chair because it's packed
so I'm just chillin standing right now I
took a tiny peek in here when I was at
the door and I see like five foundations
right now I sent him the link to my
channel in the message I don't know if
he actually looked at it but if he did
probably saw a foundation everywhere and
just bought a ton of foundations
well okay one two three four five six oh
my god
so Jordan bought me six foundation
options this is probably about a hundred
dollars right here don't quite know if I
needed six foundations but he had to
cover his bases you know he did get an
array of shades so that's good we have
the Revlon Photoready BB cream in
light/medium 20 I don't think I've ever
actually tried this have the dream
liquid mousse by Maybelline in 60 sand
beige definitely not my color but I can
maybe use this as like a bronzer
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless and
1:15 good job dude
Revlon Colorstay 150 buff the two and
one covergirl three and one simply
ageless in 2:45 warm beige I don't have
a receipt by the way so I guess all
these are going to be going to friends
they got Revlon Colorstay and II got the
combo oily version but he got the shade
200 nude which is definitely way too
dark for me shade wise I think my best
bet is probably Maybelline fit me but I
hate this foundation to have a whole
review on it I don't want to try the BB
cream because I've never tried this if
it's too dark or doesn't have enough
coverage and I can just use it as like a
base kind of definitely too dark and it
has really light coverage but it's
giving a really nice kind of luminous
healthy glow
maybe I shouldn't mix this in with Mabel
sent me actually yes what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna add a little bit more mix in
fit me and 115 I can't get over how fast
he did that he thought that he had the
ladies and CBS helped him I want to know
what woman told him to buy six
foundations also about a hundred degrees
in this room looking dewy but there
might be some sweat mixed in there way
too dark so I'm going to blend this all
the way down my neck not showing up
nearly as dark on camera as it is in
real life but my face is like orange
right now I'm supposed to go out and
have dinner with my roommate after this
it's gonna be looking good looking
bronze okay so he did give me concealer
good job think he went pretty hard in
the Revlon aisle he got a Revlon
Photoready in light/medium 0:03 maybe
since my face is dark right now this
won't be too off I don't think I've ever
used this concealer get the under eyes
real good this looks to be about the
same shade as the foundation so I might
actually use this to spot conceal to and
prime the eyes because we did not get an
eye primer I would have been thoroughly
impressed if you got an eye primer just
adding any into my acne spots so I don't
have any kind of powder whatsoever
besides a blush I'm gonna do that after
to give my skin a couple minutes to set
is putting blush on top of this super
dewy sticky face right now is going to
be hot mess so let's move on to eyes it
looks like he got me two eye products
again sticking with Revlon theme this is
the Revlon illuminants cream shadow so
cool this is in 710 not just news these
are all creams and then he got me a
little Maybelline quad over here some
nice greens so I'm gonna go in with the
cream ones first serve as kind of a base
okay so here's what the little quad
looks like light shade looks like might
be nice I want to put that all over the
lid and I don't have any brow products
either so we're going brow lift this has
a little bit of illumination to it but
for the most part it's pretty bland is
that the right word is pretty toned down
so I might actually use this this could
be a disaster but I use this to brighten
up the under eyes a little bit there we
go
I'm going to highlight my cheekbones
with this too since I don't have a
highlighter shade right here actually
might work as a face highlight too so
don't really have any crease shades in
this palette besides a sparkly green
thing I'm going to bring one these cream
brown shades into the crease first and
use this lighter brown shade right here
ooh you know what
they can use that darker one us for my
brows too I'm going to go in with the
darkest brown shades deepen it up a
little bit oh god some powder left over
in here whoops actually I don't know I
think that's the cream broad idea
confidence actually think I'm going to
take that same first Brown shape that I
put on the eye and use it as a contour
because it's pretty cool tone so it
might work blue another there we go
these actually work really well on the
face possible in those days where I just
want my hair off my head right now I do
a little nose contour action there's a
lip I think I'm going to attempt to put
this Brown in my brows it is a little
bit metallic not going to do like a
full-on brow I'm just going to add a
little bit how much totally works not
going to lie when I first saw this thing
I thought it was going to be kind of
worthless but I think this is what's
saving the day now we got to go in with
a green palette a really pretty kind of
taupe shade right here that I think I'm
going to use use my finger to put that
on the lid ooh dang I'm going to take
that white shade for the inner corner
okay now I think I'm going to go in with
a dark green but I'm going to use lip
brush I mean needs a little blending
brush to get the lower lash line with
this I don't have any kind of eyeliner
so I'm actually going to smudge this on
the top too I want to use that same
inner corner shade as a face highlight
my skin gets really weird texture when I
try and put powder on top of something
that isn't set so I'm just going to kind
of Pat this on instead of blend so you
got me two mascaras I just like to have
a plan beat this brush one looks like
it's more up my alley so I'm going to
try this one looks a little bit bigger
fluffier - I like to packaging on this
like matte black my ankles right now
which in the stance now we're doing a
lunge not bad I feel like mascara is
very just depends on personal preference
to give you guys some reference I love
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
and the Catrice glam and all I usually
layer those and get a shit-ton the
volume with that and ever
certainly took off lash extension so I
have like barely any lashes right now so
he did get me lipstick I haven't looked
at the color yet Oh a coral very summery
so he got me Revlon this is in the shade
750 kiss me coral I've been really into
these red orange kind of shades lately
it's glad I didn't go with a full-on
green smokey eye oh heck yeah I don't
have a liner anything so I'm just going
to attempt to do this as clean as
possible
besides this transferring onto my teeth
every two seconds I'm really into this
good color choice very summery this is
the True Match blush in the shade and
five six apricot kiss actually like the
shade alright so this is the final look
everything is on my face - for
foundations oh yeah
Ariana deep I think overall I give
Jordan a solid 7 he hits the basics
pretty well and he did give me lots of
options
I liked the lipstick choice I think this
thing was actually the winner out of all
this because it was just really
versatile
I actually really like it as a contour
and it looks nice as a face highlight -
just looks really natural and subtle so
I use this for a lot of different stuff
10 out of 10 pick I hope you guys liked
