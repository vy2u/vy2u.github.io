Friday and we're going to be trying out
a putty foundation at this point I feel
like I've tried out every texture
besides putty pretty much we've tried
foundation in a jar foam foundation it's
plenty time this is actually the Stila
perfectly poreless putty Perfector that
is not a joke I feel like they were all
sitting around in a room trying to think
of the most ridiculous hard to pronounce
name for this you have succeeded why was
that necessary for peace so Before we
jump into the foundation if you're new
here this is where I do a new first
impression video every single Friday on
my channel is 6:00 p.m. Pacific time all
my foundation Friday videos are linked
down below in a playlist
alright let's hop on to the website read
some of the claims about this thing so
this putty Perfector retails for $39 and
you only get 0.38 ounces of product so
you get less than half an ounce of
product for $39 that is very expensive
most liquid foundations are around one
ounce of product stick foundations are
usually around 0.46 I think around there
so there's less than both of those and
it's friggin expensive it also only
comes in five shades I have the shades
fair which is the lightest shade the
reading on Sephora it says it's an
innovative hybrid skin Perfector is my
mic on right now woop anyways by the way
I got a pop socket and it's
life-changing
innovative hybrid skin Perfector that's
a traditional pressed powder and a cream
foundation weightless invisible formula
and natural looking coverage snooze the
look of skin blurs imperfections it can
be worn alone or layered on top of
liquid foundation which is kind of
interesting supposed to be smudge proof
and waterproof long-lasting and ensures
complexion perfection from morning to
midnight says it's perfect for all skin
types those with oil prone skin will
love this oil-free formula which leaves
the skin looking matte dewy and fresh I
don't know how some things lips look
matte and dewy at the same time tell me
so that's what drier skin tones the
unique texture will not settle into fine
lines or feel cakey on the skin and
that's it okay I'm going to dig in and
play with this and show you guys to
close up because we need some putty born
right now
I'm going to search some swatches right
here of this shade compared to some of
the other foundations I have just you
can see how it compares alright so
swatch time right here is the Stila
cutting foundation in the shade fair
iced over the Urban Decay all nighter
and 0.5 derma cloud to 0-8 Loreal Pro
matte foundation and 101 and the makeup
rubber stick Foundation and 115 I think
that's everything if you're excited for
this video and you like foundation
Friday don't forget to give it a thumbs
up do you want to see how the Stila
perfectly poreless putty Perfector
applies and where throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching whew that was a close call
almost started filming without the mic
on I've already washed moisturize primed
my face my two products I use will be
listed down below okay what is ma it is
1053 in the morning it has been a
struggle and a half getting to this
point right here so since it says that
you can apply this thing on top of
foundation I'm not going to do that but
I do want a spot conceal 1/2 my face and
then just see how much coverage it has
without spot concealing this is supposed
to be kind of like a powdery finish I
don't know if I'm going to want to add
concealer on top afterwards this is the
Holika Holika cover and hiding liquid
concealer actually use this a couple
days ago for the first time to the spot
concealer because I was out of my
maybelline instant age rewind and it
works pretty well matched my skin tone
pretty well so I'm going to spot conceal
on the side of my face if this is where
I have a ton of acne if I spot conceal I
mean pretty much put concealer all over
down here
but the concealer on we'll be able to
see how the steal product applies on top
of liquid lately if I don't have a
double shot thing from Starbucks I'm not
alive so here's the side without
concealer here's the spot concealer so
let's go in with this putty so supposed
to have a natural matte finish and it
says for best results apply with their
wonder brush I think the most similar
brush I have to that is my Sigma f80 - I
might try my sponge - I don't know I
can't really see this being a sponge
kind of product packaging is pretty
light to get a sponge right here I never
use these sponge things it has a little
protective plastic thing kind of like a
cushion compact that Oh doesn't snap
shut no it just kind of chills right
there it doesn't actually totally snap
shut so if I want to dip my finger in
and then apply it and like blend out
with a brush or just stick the brush
directly in here I just want to touch it
feels more firm than I saw it this isn't
quite as exciting feels a lot more firm
than like play-doh is making an indent
right there kind of to rub to get any
kind of major product
oh I'm definitely going to dip my brush
in I'm just going in with the brush is
the way to go so I got barely any
product whoa feels super lightweight
like feels like air feels like a powder
mmm
what the heck I'm already getting some
like grabbing on to something right here
so applying it on top of the concealer
right now this is making my face look
really dry looks very natural definitely
agree with the natural coverage kind of
claim think I'm getting about medium
coverage I wouldn't even say this is
cleaning to dry patches because I really
don't feel like I have a whole lot of
dry patches right now I have combination
skin I get oily throughout today but
it's making my skin look dry so if you
have dry skin definitely not the product
for you cleaning in certain spots really
weird but when I look far away in this
mirror it just looks kind of like I'm
wearing a natural kind of powder not
looking great on my forehead looks very
dry I will try a little bit of a sponge
on this side why not
kind of drag it I covered up that acne
yeah again clinging on down here mmm I
switch back to the brush definitely a
powder finish and is looking matte for
sure right now plastic things you can
kind of pointless to me like it's just
getting in the way and since it doesn't
actually snap shut it's not like it's
keeping any kind of air out really oh
that looks pretty dry and bad I feel
like if you just looked at my face right
now and you didn't know my skin type or
anything you would think I had severely
dry skin I'm gonna see if it's buildable
since there's a lot coming through hmm I
don't think you want to build this one
up I give it a little more shot down
here it looks like I need to exfoliate
right here that's how dry and patchy is
looking I'm obviously not going to
powder my face with this one since it is
a powder finish we're gonna call the
check-in time 11:10 it's 1107 right now
so I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup
and I will be right back all right so
before I put on the rest eye makeup I
just want to show you guys hopefully you
can see what I'm saying I think you guys
can see this it's a little bit hard to
pick up on camera but there is some
major dry and patchiness right here it
also
doesn't look that great like around my
nose it looks like it's already been on
for like hours like it's worn off around
here I don't think it's totally picking
it up actually but right here there's
again more dryness this is where it
first like clung on right when I first
applied it blended it down my neck and
you can see it didn't really cover my
acne down here well my dark circles are
intense look at my forehead my forehead
looks so freakin dry pretty much all
over center of my forehead looks dry up
here looks extremely dry so I'm gonna
try and use a ton of highlighter
and stuff to hopefully bring my skin
back to life because right now I'm
looking extremely dry okay so it's now
11:57
so I have a lot of thoughts that have
quickly changed within the span of 50
minutes so first off I've never seen my
skin look drier in my entire life
putting concealer on top of this since
it does have kind of like a powder
finish I had a little bit of trouble
blending it out with kind of wanted to
stick to it since it's like a powder
does your really like textured skin and
have issues with that you might want to
put on any liquid products first with
that being said since it is a powder
finish my blush bronzer everything
blended out super easily on top but I do
feel like it almost like wiped away some
of the product from far away I feel like
it looks nice it looks natural but when
you get up close my skin just looks so
freakin dry now in the last half hour I
feel like it has kind of warmed up to my
face and as you can see my forehead
doesn't look totally matte and dry
anymore but I also did use the settings
bio settings right every single day I
just used Urban Decay all nighter and
when I sprayed this on I feel like this
actually really helped to make my face
look less dry and powdery and just kind
of like melt everything in I also doused
my face and highlighter so that's a lot
of the glow you're seeing right now but
when I look up close I still have those
same dry patches I'm curious to see how
this controls my oils throughout the day
since it is so dry but now that the rest
of my makeup is on I don't think it
looks quite as horrible as it first did
so on the rest of my face with a big
fluffy brush I use the elf air to light
invisible bronze do you feel like this
shade is a little bit light when I was
looking at it in natural lighting I
think it can work but it might be a tiny
bit light over blush I used Oprah's new
Bellini blush just like this pink one
fine I'm going to use the new Oprah
highlighter and volley at first which
was way too dark and gold so then I had
to go over it with my Physicians Formula
natural nude eyes I tried out this BH
Cosmetics
it look at this marble I'm still in love
with this packaging this is the marble
collection warm stone I spent in with a
bunch of these shades and like usual
beige cosmetics nine out of ten times
their eyeshadows are bomb lashes I use
one of my favorites the carat s for
these are dollar lashes a link them down
below bare minerals liquid lipstick in
the shade
this is the first liquid lipstick of
theirs I've tried this smells literally
exactly like brownie batter literally
identical I don't know how you're not
supposed to eat this so I think that's
everything on my face necklace link down
below it's from Rob's box so again we're
calling the second time 11:10 the next
check and idea will be an astral
lighting so I'll see you guys in few
hours hopefully after I've had a really
productive few hours because then you do
all right so it's almost 4:00 p.m. so
it's been on for about five hours now I
was just standing in front of the oven
and now I'm freezing someone else did
that after you cook like let the heat
heat up your body but now I feel like
I'm in the freakin igloo so my lashes
are off let's look at the foundation
overall I actually think it looks a lot
better than when I first applied it
probably because the oils from my skin
are kind of coming through and making it
look like skin not a piece of matzah
love the dryness and crack eNOS has kind
of gone away a bit I think the parts
where it looks bad are on my forehead it
looks like it's almost like worn off or
it's just like not sticking to my acne
really I'm any kind of asking your
texture is just still grabbing there but
on the rest of my face like if you
didn't have acne or a lot of texture I
could see this kind of warming up and
looking a little bit better
until them zooming or if I just move the
camera closely there we go I just ate
and here's how the lipstick is holding
up so I do think the center of my
forehead looks a little bit better than
it did this morning
but anywhere around like the perimeter
of my face does not look good it looks
like it's like totally worn off and I
haven't even been touching my face or
anything up here it looks really dry and
it is kind of settling into my line
right here getting a little bit of
creasing on my upper lip right here
once it looks good but it doesn't look
horrible definitely looking still a bit
dry and everything around here you just
look at my face right now I do think it
looks natural like it doesn't look like
I have a ton of face makeup on or
anything but that's also probably
because like halves of this worn off so
by the end of the night we'll see how
this controls my oil five hours in looks
better than before doesn't look good
okay so it's eight o'clock and doing the
an hour early because body's feeling
pretty crappy right now and I'm going to
go lay down so it's been on for nine
hours and I actually think it looks
really nice at this point I feel like
it's worn better throughout the day this
is not nearly as like broken down and
oily as I usually get still looks bad on
my forehead up here and on the dry areas
where it kind of clung to but as far as
like the center of my face and just
overall when you look at my face from
far away it looks nice same situation
and worn off in the same areas that I
told you guys in last check-ins I'm not
going to touch on that I feel like it's
controlled my oil pretty well I mean I
am duly on my forehead but I actually
like that I think it just looks more
like skin right now so I'm kind of
confused kind of torn my lipstick is
down on my shins
so what sticker does it totally we're
off right there oh it has completely
rubbed off on my chin I just noticed
okay so when I step more into the light
so I can actually see it's actually
completely rubbed off in certain areas
of my face on my chin over here and also
all around here it's like not even on my
face anymore nevermind
I retract those previous statements
could not see from where I was standing
before like worn off around here and
then it's almost like bunching up right
here oh is this the worst wearing thing
I've ever worn definitely not I don't
far away at this point I think it looks
fine did not like it for the first two
hours do I think it's worth 38 or 39
dollars whatever it was for me
definitely not I think it just has too
many problem areas and issues for me to
reach for again but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
you give it a thumps up I'm going to go
lay down
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
