wrench moves on look I'm wearing right
now in my last fall haul video I
mentioned a bunch of new makeup I got so
we're testing it out today trying this
bad boy out we're also going to be doing
a taste test throughout this video of
candy club candy for breakfast you can't
go wrong if you guys want to see how I
got this full mat I look you're in the
right place just keep watching all right
definitely just started talking and
realized I never hit record my
foundation is already on because I'm
doing a first impression on the new Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation stick
well can we just get really dark I have
my segues that video is already up so if
you want to see my thoughts on this
foundation I'll link it down below and
in the little eye on the corners I'm
taking the NYX HD concealer this is an
oldie but a goodie I don't know why it
picks this up the other day just
speaking to me I'm going to do a tiny
bit of highlighting but not too much
because I don't want to mess with the
foundation like always I'm going to set
the under-eye with my Physicians Formula
translucent correcting powder and put
whatever is left over on that brush just
dab it on the center of my face in my
chin I am going to be super lightly
setting this foundation with a powder
just because it is super luminous and
I've been using this every single day so
I feel like it's a fair comparison this
is a cosmetic bye bye pores press powder
they have a loose powder and a pressed
powder version now you need this in your
life this is frickin amazeballs I did a
whole Instagram post on it but I'm just
in love with this it makes your skin so
soft help set your makeup I just use a
super light hand like I'm barely
applying anything is gonna help mattify
it a little bit but you can still see
like my skin still looks like skin which
is one of the things I think is hardest
when you're trying to find a good
setting powder I don't like my face to
be fully matte alright so while we do
this shadow in shmooze video we are
going to drink some coffee and eat some
candy healthy breakfast so I got this
box from candy club which I haven't
opened yet
and it sounds like they're just like
jewelry in here 11 a.m. feeding candy
I like their packaging look how freaking
cute this is oh heck yeah
okay I'm Way too excited for this I have
never tried candy club before I'm super
excited for this they're basically like
a candy of the month kind of box there's
a freaking box for everything now I'm
alright there's three different options
but you can basically pay $19.99 per
month and you get a box of three candies
I'm going to start out with the
jellybeans
look how freaking cute itches when you
go on candy club you can take like a
candy survey so they can actually put
candies in your box that you want and
that you like pops open super easily
whoo I am so excited right now what's
your guys favorite jelly bean flavor let
me know down below I'm all about the red
and green so much better than cereal I
could eat this whole thing right now
these are Gimbels sour gourmet jelly
beans
from San Francisco alright we're going
to continue on the make up and just keep
tasting some candy okay so we're gonna
put the brows on I'm actually using
benefits gimme brow in this video just
because I've been trying to use this up
I do like it but I just think my old one
is so much better for the price they're
super comparable and I really need to
pluck my eyebrows right now I probably
should have done that before this video
but life actually had a like mini
meltdown this morning I opened my Amazon
affiliate account and it had been closed
so that's great so basically I have to
go back in through hundreds of videos
and re link everything the joys of
YouTube I've been using the BH Cosmetics
Studio Pro eyebrow palette almost every
single day I use this in my last shadow
to schmooze video I've been really
enjoying it I pretty much go in with
this shade every day and then sometimes
we'll add a little bit of the black or a
little bit of that shadow preyas is like
under ten or twelve dollars so to get
that many different shades and the
quality I think it's totally worth it I
can just tell us it's not going to be a
good brow day we just need to accept
defeat right now and move on with life I
was going to go in with that dark brown
shade right here at the powder I did end
up microwaving my anastasia dipbrow
someone suggested to do that if it's
dried out and it totally worked
so thank you to
I recommended that if you microwave it
for about 10 seconds it makes it feel
brand new again like it's not all
crumbly and disgusting anymore
mmm these red ones so good you could
totally save these containers when it
runs out and either like washi tape the
front of this or just spray-paint it I
will probably do that oh yeah I am all
about the sour red things what do these
actually cold
wild cherry belts the sound just like
opening a pink can my other one just
popped off with my finger if you can't
get it open just pry it open with some
scissors or a butter knife oh they smell
so good I'm so excited
those are my favorite by the way I do
have a $10 off code for candy club if
you guys want to try it out if this is
your first box you can get $10 off this
would be a really good holiday gift so
for bronzer I'm gonna take the body shop
0-1
I think it's called honey honey bronzer
something it actually doesn't say on the
back I got this because of Holly's
lipstick she uses this and I'm so glad I
got this I've been using this every
single day if you have fair skin this is
the most beautiful bronzing shade ever
and it just blends out so easily is the
perfect shade even if you don't have
fair skin like get the next shade up
this powder just blends out beautifully
body shop always has like buy three get
three free deals so just wait until that
goes on sale and blend a little bit of
this on my temples this smells exactly
like a cherry jelly Rancher have this
Too Faced mini kit thing how freaking
cute is this this one their holiday kids
they have three different shades I think
it just comes with a melted lipstick and
then a mini two face blush look at this
thing
feel like this is a really unique color
this is your love as king I don't think
I've ever used like this kind of shade
of blush so I have no idea what its
gonna look like deep fall kind of berry
color ooh that is pretty I feel like
that gives you like they just went
outside and I'm freezing kind of cheeks
you know I'm saying even though I'm
really sitting indoors at 11 a.m.
eating candy I'm just going to take my
powder brush and just kind of blow us
out a little bit I mentioned this in my
fall haul video this is the brand new
over cosmetics you glow girl this was a
clap with Dew
out which is an Instagram account that
does like dupes and swatches and things
this looks beautiful
super excited to try this it's like a
light pink shimmery highlight I've only
swatched it on my hand and it looks like
heaven so I'm excited to see what it
looks like on the face oh yes
I'm feeling it I take a little bit down
the bridge of my nose
keep this bow I usually set my face
before I do any kind of eye makeup
anything and so I'm just gonna go in
with my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
setting spray I always do this when I do
first impressions because it's what I do
every single day just take a quick
shower
well that's drying I'm going to prime
the eyes with Mac's Paint Pot in soft
ochre this one's brand new this is just
like a yellow a lighter yellow version
of the painterly shade so for eyes we're
gonna go in with the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette for the first time
haven't watched this at all it's going
to do a whole first impression on this
thing but we'll just do it here
ask you guys on Twitter what I look you
wanted to see in this video if you're
not following me on Twitter it's the
tail of same as all of my social accept
snapchat which is the tail snaps a lot
of people wanted to see a all matte eye
look so we're going to be using the Kat
Von D shade and light palette for this
we're gonna start out with this warm
shade don't do warm liquor cool I don't
know we'll see what happens I'm gonna go
in with this shade right here blend this
into the crease well super pigmented
random thought I painted my nails the
other night and it started bubbling like
I have bubbles on my nails does anyone
know why that happened I think it was
something with my top coat
who knows nice let me take this light
pale yellowish shade and just use that
to like further blend out who I really
need to put the brows sorry guys let's
use this this is the it cosmetics
heavenly luxe dual eyeshadow number 5
there's a small end right here and then
a bigger blending end I'm going take
this shade right here we're just going
to start to blend that into the crease a
little bit I'm also going to bring this
on the inner corner I want to do like a
smoked out kind of matte eye
frame and all these are blending out
super easily candy break last thing I
have are these gummies I'm not a huge
gummy fan but we'll see what are these
oh they're butterflies Wow super soft
these feel like really fresh are those
your might I usually gummies is because
I feel like if to chew them for like an
hour these are actually super soft I'm
kind of feeling putting this sheet on
the lid I don't know just going to take
this morphe brush and go in with that
warm brown shade oh heck yeah that shade
is beautiful cap blend it out super
easily and it's really pigmented I feel
like usually when I do lids on my lips
on my shadow usually when I do a shadow
on my lid I have to blend it out with my
finger just to get more pigmentation but
this is like looking good I'm going to
go in with this deeper brown shade right
next to it we're just going to use this
to deepen up the crease a little bit the
tiny bit of that inner corner as well
okay I'm going to go back in with the
first shade that we use and just blend a
little bit more of this into the crease
to warm it up a little bit I'm going
take the other end of that a cosmetics
brush and blend that same color on the
bottom lash line if you have green eyes
this color just makes them pop I'm going
to take a tiny bit of the warm brown
shade and put that on the outer corner
I'm gonna go in with my favorite la girl
glide on gel pencil this is an awesome
super affordable eyeliner for the
waterline I think this is under like $2
you get on i Kate house I'll link it
down below we're just gonna apply this
to the waterline
for eyeliner I'm going to go into the
H&amp;amp;M precision eye markers this is super
nice matte black super black eyeliner
Physicians Formula is still my favorite
like Holy Grail eyeliner but when I want
a super matte really
I don't think there's even a one out
there to mow okay I just applied mascara
to my top lashes and now I'm applying
the skeeto lash Laurette have it on this
eye I like it they look natural but they
still look nice and like separating and
wispy so I'm gonna go ahead and apply
the other one now I've already trimmed
these down using my duo brush on
adhesive with vitamins that's I'm
dressed and everything that this tube is
looking pretty janky I should probably
get a new one but it still works go back
for a third round of these these are
bombed this is definitely drag whoops
those too long so I somehow ended up
losing my wet wild mega length mascara I
need to go get another one
so I'm just going to use the falsies
push-up mascara for the bottom lash want
to make sure you don't look down right
after you apply bottom mascara because
it can get on the concealer for lips I'm
kind of feeling like a burnt ready color
this is in the shade love good and then
this is lot a confession both by la /
mmm
ooh I don't know actually I'm going to
go in with love good yeah
all right so this is the final look if
