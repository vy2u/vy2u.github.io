break alright so today we have my
perfume collection I just ate an entire
pizza and I'm sitting here without pants
talking about perfume life so I've been
meaning to make this video for a while I
just bought two new perfumes so I
figured now would be a good time here
are oh gosh here are all of my children
I keep them sitting on my vanity this
definitely needs to be dusted off I'm
gonna have to reorganize all these
because my two new ones don't fit on
here if you're wondering I believe I got
my perfume tray from home goods like a
couple years ago I think I've always
been really into perfumes since high
school I had like 25 body sprays they
don't remember the days in like middle
school locker rooms when everyone whips
out their Victoria Secret body splash I
feel like all of my perfumes are my
favorite so I don't even know what order
to go in right now I think I'm just
gonna start out with my current
favorites the ones I've been wearing the
most lately yeah let's do that crap on
you know what this one is called so
perfume I wore most frequently this past
year is definitely Burberry Brit I think
this bottles bright I'll leave it down
below once I figure it out my roommate
when I first moved to Seattle she wore
this stuff and it smelled so freakin
good on her is a very unique scent I'm
gonna leave a few of the notes for each
perfume down below but I feel like
explaining it does nothing like does
anyone know what sandalwood smells like
I still don't I feel like the most
helpful thing about these videos is that
once you can see if you perfume so
someone likes if you also have those
perfumes in common I feel like there's a
good chance that you might like the
other ones it smells a little bit
sweeter but there's still that muskiness
to it I got like a third of my perfumes
off of fragrance net that's where I got
this one and a couple others I'll show
you there's one of those websites that
have super markdown deal I rarely pay
full price for a perfume because you can
usually find it on there they also have
like glam glow and stuff on there which
I don't know my current obsession is
alien by Thierry Mugler Mugler very
moogly Thierry Mugler who knows look at
this bottle so freaking beautiful I love
the purple and gold and how it looks
kind of like geometric of all these
little samples sitting here of this
perfume because I
gone through like ten of these whenever
it's in the checkout section at Sephora
as when they're free sample things I
always took throw it in and I finally
caved and I got this on fragrance net I
think it was like $20 or $30 cheaper
than it usually is smells so good tailor
notes right here it's like mysterious
and professional I wear this to work but
I just wear a tiny tiny bit and this is
when those perfumes that I've gotten
questions about when I'm wearing it
my next all-time favorite perfume is
it's gotta into the blue and this is
actually the second bottle of this I
believe this is now a discontinued which
is really sad I bought this as like the
tester bottle when I was in Jordan like
ten dollars is totally legit it stays on
all day and now I just hoard it because
I don't want it to ever be empty this is
a total guy I think about it like
whenever you're in the car with guys or
something every single time someone
comments on how you smell when you're
wearing this this is like a total going
out perfume for me that's like the only
time I wear it I'll try and find it on
Amazon or Ebay for you guys probably
like ridiculously expensive because if
they did stop making it another going
out perfume is my DKNY Apple and I'm
almost out of this yeah as whereas my
sophomore junior year of college it
doesn't smell like Apple to me at all
this one smells very sexy and yeah
that's like the only word I have to
describe this one this is a really
recent purchase I think I got this in
December I believe this was limited
edition this is Jimmy Choo why don't
they freaking print the name of it on
here I think this was stars as well as
that I sprayed on when I was walking
around in Ulta and I literally could
smell it on that jacket like four days
later and I finally caved this was super
expensive
it's Jimmy Choo but look at this bottle
it is rose bold it is perfect almost has
like a similar smell to it as this
Burberry perfume super musky but a
little bit of an Ella in here there must
be vanilla I don't know that's what I
smell I have a sample size scent bird
size and full size now of the Daisy by
Marc Jacobs I think this one especially
smells really different on certain
people this is like my total work
perfume it smells very floral e when I
first spray it on me I almost smell like
rapes or something I'm not making this
sound very good this is one of those
perfumes expels better as the day goes
on in your body's pheromones or whatever
leave its way in
is that what pheromones do this is more
of like a summary perfume I don't really
see myself wearing this that much in the
winter evil with juicy and this is
Lafleur and this one just like means a
lot to me because I got this when I was
living in Israel for the summer after
Jordan I was like going through a lot
that summer and one day I just went and
I was like I'm gonna spend however many
freaking shekels on a perfume because
that's what I feel like I lost the
sprayer somewhere I need to get another
one of those so I haven't been able to
wear this in a while I actually like to
smell this a lot better than the classic
viva la juicy next I have my guest
seductive this is another work perfume
this is like one of the winter perfumes
Rach my best friend got me this one and
we were in Fred Meyer when I first had
my interview in Seattle from what the
job I have right now it just reminds me
of that weekend getting a job and like
moving up here this is what I wore when
we went out that night to celebrate I
really like this I feel like you can
wear this going out or everyday slash to
work it definitely is on the musky err
side but also smells like really clean
to me I have a couple different Ralph
Lauren perfumes this one is like fully
empty I should probably get rid of this
this is eyebrow edge this is Ralph
Lauren hot and this one smells super
sweet this is for sure the sweetest
smelling perfume I own I don't think I
would repurchase this just because I'm
not really into the scent anymore but I
wore that a lot in high school Ralph
Lauren cool I think it's called cool
seriously why don't they print the name
on the bottom this one smells super
fresh this reminds me of summer fresh
summery youth all of that good stuff
then I have the lovely olya calm perfume
I smelled us in like a boutique thing
and then it warded it off of Amazon this
wasn't my favorite probably a year ago I
wear this a lot senior year of college
I'm not super into this anymore just
because I feel like it smells a little
bit too Cologne II I kind of feel like a
dude when I wear this but I really like
the scent I might just start using it as
like a bedroom spray or something
because I really like house smells but
if you like really
skill nguy kind of sense this smells
amazing and it stays on wine break
Victoria Secret incredible this one is
almost empty is what I use when it's
like the weekend and I have on like yoga
pants or something but I still want to
smell good it just smells really sweet
and not too overpowering it almost
smells like a body splat I really like
this one I would definitely repurchase
this another Victoria's Secret is
bombshell and I find that their body
splashes last almost better than their
perfumes do does that happen for anyone
else this smells super clean like so
kind of clean Victoria Secret very sexy
this is like my scent for going out this
reminds me of freshman year of college I
think this is my second or third bottle
of this and it just smells so freakin
good I feel like I will always be
obsessed with this it lasts forever
you need this let me know down below
what your guys is favorite perfumes are
if you have any of the same ones that I
do let me know which one you have and
which other perfume you like I feel like

perfumes that people are into and if
you'll also like it but yeah this video
has been requested for a while I
mentioned it in a vlog I'm not sure if
this video will be at first but
