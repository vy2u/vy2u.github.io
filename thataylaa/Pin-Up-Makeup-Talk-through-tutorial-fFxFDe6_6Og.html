clearly this has been super highly
requested you can wear this for
Halloween or if you just want to rock
the pinup book on the daily whatever
floats your boat most of the products
that I used are from glambot you guys
have heard me talked about this company
before I'm obsessed with them you can
buy your cell used makeup they have this
super intense Sanitation process so if
your drama folk don't worry about it you
get super discounted high-end makeup if
you're a limited-edition matte person
that would really check back on our
website every day because there's new
stuff and it's amazing I'll have a
coupon and link down below so make sure
you check out the down bar I don't have
a hair tutorial for this because hair is
not my thing I burned myself three times
while trying to do this I basically just
did a normal button and then did this
curl thing which took me literally 25
attempts I hate hair again apologies
that this took forever to get up life
has been kinda crazy if you want to see
how I did this pin-up look this is a
shadow move style video so I talked
through everything let's do it
all right so I've already primed my face
with benefit Porefessional I'm use the
Revlon Colorstay foundation this is just
a really great long-lasting pretty matte
foundation and I'm going to mix in some
of the Smashbox artificial light is from
glambot I love how they put the seal on
here so you know that it's been
sanitized as they can get I've never
used this product I kind of want to see
if it's more of the it looks like it's
more of a mixed in kind of product so
I'm going to go ahead and mix in some of
the Revlon on the back of my hand this
is the first thing I'm saying all
morning so that's why sound tap sleep so
don't else hate when you do this and
your arm is like flapping all over the
place but apply this I'm just going to
using my Real Techniques sponge I love
this thing as you use this when I want
more of a dewy look
definitely burnt my forehead as I was
trying to curl my hair need to cover
that up
so for concealers I'm going to mixing
these two products you don't know how
many times she's tried to say that
Smashbox concealer is super creamy and
blends out super easily you definitely
want to make sure you set it with the
powder though so it doesn't crease set
the under eyes like always I'm using my
Physicians Formula translucent light
setting powder this is just light enough
for my skin and my favorite way to apply
slipping ELF powder brush I just feel
like I don't know just gets the job done
my brush smells like chocolate from the
cocoa powder foundation Irish I don't
think it really smells like chocolate I
feel like it's more like marshmallows
I'm just going to be putting a little
bit of the Too Faced cocoa powder
foundation on top just to set everything
I do have a whole review video on this
stuff I'm obsessed with it to them for
blush we're going into the glam bought
bag how freaking cute is this packaging
so here's the blush we're going to be
using actually should be contour I'll be
doing a little contour with Mac's
taupe blush this is just a matte blush
is good for fair-skinned like how all my
roommates are still sleeping right now
and I'm just chillin pinup makeup
alright now we have some cheekbones
delight I'm using my truck using my
favorite it cosmetics blush brush this
actually as a foundation brush but I
love it for applying blush ooh
this stuff is pigmented and we go back
in with my powder brush and blend
everything out on a little more bright
and highlighted under the eye so I'm
going to go in with manic panics white
pressed powder I don't use this stuff
too often because it is literally white
but if I want a little more highlight
under the eyes this is a good good
option feel more wink already so for
this look we're going to be using the
brow bar to go just the wax from here
and I just like to use the brush that it
comes with I just go in with the wax
product and then create the shape that
we are going to do so I mention this in
my September raves and rejects video but
I've been really liking using blackout
from the Naked 2 palette for my brows
it's literally just a matte black
eyeshadow obviously if you don't have
black hair you'll want to address
accordingly
zoomed you guys in a bit for the eyes
what this is hair doing the prime the
eyes are gonna be using the BH Cosmetics
Studio Pro waterproof eye primer haven't
tested the waterproof clean yet but I do
like it as an eye primer it kind of
sucks as this Punk gets like stuck so
you don't want to get too much out on
your finger so I'm just gonna apply this
everywhere that we are applying
eyeshadow I have such issues using my
left hand how cool would that be a few
Ram dextrous so for this entire look I'm
going to try and use this Smashbox
palette from glam box is the limitless
Beauty eyeshadow palette I think these
are super neutral which is what I'm
going for and I think they're mad
fingers crossed so it looks like some of
these are shimmery and some are matte
and we using these two matte shades and
then for the lid increase we're going to
use some other matte colors since we
want to major winged I'm going to tape
off my eyes and I'm just going to stick
it on the back of my hand first to take
away some of the stick if you wanted to
you could do your eye shadow before the
foundation that just never goes well for
me I'm going to be taking me it's Judy's
time pallet with the Sigma e-40 a fluffy
blending brush going in with this matte
shade right here put this all in the
crease feel like I can't move when I
have taken my angles eyeshadow is going
to be pretty simple it's really going to
be all about the liner and ellipse once
we have our crease color on there nice
and blended I'm going to go in with the
lightest shade and the Smashbox palette
I think I'm just going to use my finger
and just pop this on the lid I'm going
to take the lightest shade in those
shooties time palette and put this under
the brow bone picks them with this elf
little tiny brush I don't even know what
this is called I'm using the dark brown
shade in here just to find the crease a
little bit and as you're doing this you
can kind of blend it upwards into that
crease color if you have hooded lids
like I do you might want to draw this a
little bit higher than your actual
crease go back in with the e-40 brush
and just blend it's funny because you
guys see like five minutes but this
literally sit here for like an hour or I
do at least I'm popping some of that
white powder just in the very center to
make my eyes look bigger for eyeliner I
think I'm just going to use my
Physicians Formula
eye booster first and then go over it
with some black gel liner if we think I
need it
so I'm just going to follow the line of
this tape so when we pull it away we're
going to have a super nice crispy wing
PES the goal is to make our eyes look
really big with this wing I'm not going
to come in too far it's going to mainly
focus the wing on the outer third
it's okay this is messy because we're
just going to pull away that tape guys
ready and go in and fill any of the
little lines in so to help brighten up
the eye even more we're going to go in
with this NARS white pencil this is in
the shade larger than life this is also
one of my glambot purchases whoa this is
cool twists up from the bottom I don't
think I've ever had an eyeliner like
that every time
so for lashes I'm going to be using
Barbara by ohm eyelash if you follow
their Instagram but they give out and
tighten up like free lash coupons in
 so that's when I got these I like
these because they're short enough and
they're pretty what's the word I'm
looking for gold but then they kind of
wisp out when my transit let's just not
say it I'm just and trim used to my eye
apply them and it will be right there so
I've got my falsies on put on some top
mascara and some bottom mascara I feel
like we need a little more going on in
the inner corner Annie's Mac vanilla
pigment this is just a little sample jar
of it NYX also makes a really good
shaggy why pigment I can't remember the
name of it but it's just there like
pearl white color actually Michael pearl
it's gonna pop this on the inner corner
also go and put this on my Cupid's bow
and then a tiny bit down the ridge my
nose
Matt a quick highlight I'm just using
mary lou manizer by the balm you would
also use the matte vanilla pigment on
your cheekbone so if your lips are going
to be using two of the colourpop lip
products I did a whole first impression
and trying to give these which I'll link
over here if you haven't seen it yet I'm
obsessed with these Reds so I'm starting
out with bitch at liner this is just a
matte matte red liner
I don't really like to overdraw my top
lip too much but I do a little bit on
the bottom oh yeah
so I'm going to go in with bitch at the
lipstick version struggles real that's
how you apply lipstick with the lip ring
if anyone's wondering alright so this is
the final look I think I like it what do
you guys think if you recreate this and
wear it on Halloween or wherever make
sure you tag me on instagram or twitter
love you guys thanks for watching CMS
