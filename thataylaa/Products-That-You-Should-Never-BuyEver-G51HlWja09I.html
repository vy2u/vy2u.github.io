that I hate all of these things I
don't know why they were made or how it
got through a whole line of people in
the company that decided the product is
good and that they should sell it no one
along the way decided that this was a
shitty product I used to wonder why
people made these videos because I want
to know things to buy um but these are
so horrible that I think you should know
not to buy them simple as that
first thing is the Ben Nye final seal
matte makeup sealer supposed to hold
your makeup I thought it would be really
good because obon ibn is a theater
makeup um company so their makeup
theoretically should laugh this is
scented water this is makeup setting
spray scented water spray it smells like
 Trident gum what the I do
not want this on my face that doesn't
work second thing is the NYX brown
lipstick in orange soda people really
like these lipsticks I'm not quite sure
why this is orange like straight-up
orange I don't know what skin tone that
would be flattering on not just the
color but I hated hated hated the way
that this went on you know those
lipsticks where you can see like the
Crocs in your lips even if you apply a
chapstick before that's what this does
it smells like looks like
don't buy this next thing is the wet and
wild h2o proof liquid liner this would
be great if it didn't say it was
waterproof looks like that it looks good
it has like a thick black line the first
time I put this on I was like all over
like just like the weight goes on my
friend made me laugh and it looked like
I just got broke up with next
thing is elf liquid eyeliner I only have
this green one with me but I also had
the black one
know why people like this brush is like
stiff okay how this comes off on my hand
you can't make a straight line or
anything because it's just like you can
it doesn't stay on the color isn't
vibrant it just isn't worth your money
at all okay the next thing I'm going to
get a lot of for because almost
people are like obsessed with this
concealer I don't really understand it
honestly I got it because of all the
hype on YouTube it's the instant age
rewind maybelline dark circle eraser
concealer I don't absolutely hate this
but I don't know what the big deal is
like it's just a concealer but
you're supposed to wind it and it takes
forever to come out like what the
is this I do not want to sit here
cranking this freaking stick for a half
hour in the morning when I'm trying to
get ready I don't know I just it doesn't
really do anything like a heavy duty
concealer which it doesn't claim to be
but it does claim to treat under-eye
circles and I don't even feel like it
covers that up and I don't have dark
circles doesn't cover like it's not a
concealer I don't know what it is next
thing is the China Glaze crackle polish
this doesn't crackle I thought I
was just doing it wrong so I tried it
again it doesn't crackle out to some
clearance at Sally's so maybe that
explains it there's not much to say
about this it just doesn't work so don't
buy it the Rimmel London lasting finish
foundation people either really like
this or really hate it I obviously
didn't like it because in this video I
don't know it just feels really oily it
does have some coverage to it yeah it
just Oh feels it feels so greasy
it feels more like a tinted moisturizer
to me it really wouldn't recommend it I
feel like it just clogs my pores and is
like really oily and just doesn't feel
good on my face next thing is the
Jordana
eye primer um I really really like this
when I
started using it because I like really
thick creamy eye primers that you can
feel on your eyes and feel like the
eyeshadows sticking - I do like how it's
really thick it doesn't make your
eyeshadow stay on any longer than any
other primer or anything the plus is
that this is like two dollars I think on
cherry culture comm so if you're looking
for a cheap eye primer um I guess I
would recommend this I'm not like oh my
god this is amazing it's definitely not
substituting my Mac painterly paint-pot
but if you do need a cheap I primer I
would go for this just for what it
claims to do um I wouldn't recommend it
so those were all the products that I
hate really didn't like the way they
went on they weren't worth the money and
I wish I never bought if you like some
of these then great I'm glad it works
for you I just want to make this video
so you guys know not to buy these and if
you're thinking of buying them and I
don't know what else that thank you guys
