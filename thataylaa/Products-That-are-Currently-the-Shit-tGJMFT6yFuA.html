at college after five freaking months I
know why I'm complaining at five months
summer but I'm finally back at college I
am somewhat moved into my apartment as
you can see I have my room starting to
come together if you've been following
my Instagram then you can see some of
the DIYs I've been up to let me know if
you guys want a room tour when it is
complete anyways now I'm getting settled
in and I feel like I'm really low right
now I don't even have a chair yet so I'm
just standing I will be having regular
videos coming out again thumbs up if you
like regular videos I thought I'd start
off with the products that are currently
Lee shit video because I've missed some
monthly favorites videos I've been going
for a little if you are a new subscriber
or you didn't know I got back from the
Middle East was there for a year and now
this is my senior year of college and
I'm back in America I have a whole other
update coming next but since I missed so
many monthly favorites videos I thought
I would just combine all of my favorites
right now into one video the first thing
that I've been obsessed with lately is
the joy coat color indoor conditioner
and this is sulfate free I usually don't
go for high-end shampoos and
conditioners I just don't see that much
of a difference and I love my Pantene
but I found this at Ross for 9.99 and
it's usually $20 it smells literally how
those conditioners and shampoos that
just smell like the hair salon like when
you get out of the shower you're like I
smell like the fucking salon that's what
this is probably because they use joy
cone a lot of hair salons gotta love
Ross next thing is this maybelline
superstay 14 hour lipstick this is in
the shade continuous cranberry this
stuff doesn't freakin move it definitely
doesn't stay on 14 hours I'll say good
stays on a good 3 to 4 hours without
moving which is pretty good
now the lip stain it has more of a I
don't want to swatch it because it won't
come off my hand definitely not a glossy
finish it's somewhere between a gloss
and matte so I guess the satin finish
we have a name for that next current
thing that I am obsessed with is Ebates
I have a whole other video about Ebates
on my how to save money shopping online
video I'll link it down below but
basically Ebates is a website that gives
you cash back every time you shop online
and since I've been back in America I
have been doing way too much online
shopping but I'm making money so it's
justified right gives you cash back on
every purchase and it also gives you a
free ten dollar Target gift card on your
first purchase of twenty five dollars so
the link for you base will be down below
the next thing is this moisturizer it is
the Olay long lived moisture satin
finish and this is the new their new
line the fresh effects line first of all
this stuff is the shit because it has a
pump we all love things with pumps
second of all it has a very fresh scent
and it doesn't feel heavy at all it
really does leave you feeling like a
satin finish it feels somewhat more like
a primer I would say it doesn't have
that like silicone texty textin see what
the word texture but it definitely it's
not like a thick moisturizer so with
this stuff I haven't really been needing
a primer under my foundation because
like I said it kind of has that primer
consistency so that's nice you can
eliminate a product and yeah like this
next thing is the Milani eyebrow pencil
in dark brown I had to go to literally
five different CVS's before this thing
was on the freakin shelf
I used this about a year ago and then
when I was in Jordan I ran out so I
obviously wasn't able to get it so I
wanted to pick it up again so literally
the best eye pencil I've ever found it
just glides on so easily it has this
little spoolie thing at the other end so
you can comb out your brows that's what
I'm wearing right now it's an automatic
pencil so you just roll it up there's
literally nothing bad I can say about
this they have the dark brown shade and
the natural taupe shade which I also
have and I kind of like to use the
natural taupe shade to fill in like the
front parts and then on the top next is
the Neutrogena Neutrogena oil-free acne
stress control triple action toner
I clearly have been using this because
it's almost gone I swear to god this
stuff works miracles and when I was in
Jordan my skin was horrible if you
follow my Instagram I was instagramming
pictures of it and when I came back I
was thinking about going on accutane and
then I was like you know what I'm gonna
do my acne research and see if there is
some other stuff that will work before I
go and just kill my liver and also
college is starting and you can't drink
when you're in academic when I'm gonna
go there so basically I did a
combination of researching and going
back to products that I used on my skin
was like perfectly clear like a year ago
and this is one of the things I used to
use and it is just a toner he says that
trees acne before it emerges it
eliminates oil and shine and it
refreshes and soothes and it definitely
does that you can feel it working like
you can feel it getting into your pores
magic happens
it has salicylic acid in it 2% and also
it fired
and just helps to neutralize the oil in
your skin and I actually have noticed
that my skin is a lot less oily
you just get to the fire next is the
million dollar tan Cabana tan this isn't
the extreme like most people have they
did send me this I asked to have the
lighter shade since I do have very fair
skin I am going to have a whole other
review coming out on this stuff I've
very mixed reviews about the company
however product wise I really like the
product think I'm gonna do like a
comparing Sun Goddess versus million
dollar tan because you guys know that I
love my self tanners that's helped an
almost every day I'm clearly a little
bit on the pale side right now this
stuff is literally impossible I'm pretty
sure to get streaky it's perfect if
you're a beginner I do have the coupon
code if you want to try this stuff out I
will list it right here next is the
suave keratin infusion dry shampoo I
never really have high hopes for dry
shampoos because usually they don't
freakin work I don't even know why they
put half of them on the shelves - this
one is frickin amazeballs I used to use
the Dove dry shampoo but that one has
freaking issues I don't know what the
deal is with that but and I've heard
other people say this - I literally
spray the aerosol can twice and it's
empty
I didn't pay five freakin dollars for an
aerosol can this stuff has lasted me
about three months now and it still has
plenty of product in it thing that I
really like is that it doesn't smell
like an old lady it just smells like a
fresh like hairspray it doesn't have
that gross like dry shampoo smell that
they usually do even if my hair isn't
super dirty sometimes I'll just spray it
in and like use it as a way to tease my
hair so so that was my products that are
currently the shit video thumbs up if
you like this video and comment down
below if you guys want a room tour when
it is complete and also let me know what
your current favorite products are
because I need more stuff to buy okay
