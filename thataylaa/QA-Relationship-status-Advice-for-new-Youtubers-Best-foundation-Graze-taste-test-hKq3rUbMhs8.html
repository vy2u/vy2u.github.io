silence I like don't do kale in any form
pretty excited for this video right now
because I am freaking hangry so I asked
you guys on Instagram to ask any
questions that you want answered in this
video so we are just gonna answer some
fa Q's and eat some good snacks I did
film a shadow muse and look I'm wearing
right now I'm not sure how much video
will be up first but if it's already up
I'll link it over here if not it'll
probably be the next video up so as we
answer some questions I'm gonna be
trying out Grey's decided to try this
because a their packaging is adorable B
I've heard really good things about this
so I'm excited if you follow me on
Twitter and stuff you probably know that
I've been kind of and it's like eating a
healthy ish thing I just like to have my
core meals healthy now if I just feel
better you know
so anyways grace is a snack subscription
box they have smaller like unique
healthier kind of snacks and wait till
you see this packaging so you have a
tasting box where you get four and you
can get it for free and how freaking
cute is this packaging like look at this
with a package em they're the perfect
portions and it tells you how many
calories and stuff on the front and then
I also have the eight snack box so it's
born the top and then four down here so
I'm probably gonna be just digging into
a mix of these you can get this one for
1199 and I divide it out and that's a
dollar fifty per snack so when you think
of it that's like pretty much the same
price as buying a box of chip a box of
chips bag of chips so super reasonably
priced and these are like healthier
alternatives the other thing I like is
that they deliver to work or home so if
you're someone who works in an office
like myself you can get a deliverer
there they designed their box so they
fit in a standard mail box so you don't
have to sign for your packages that's a
big bonus for me because I'm never home
during the day to sign for my packages
the UPS guy knows me really well half
the time I have to like redirect my
packages and it's a giant pain in the
ass so no redirecting it just comes in
your mailbox let's just start okay this
looks fun this is sweet mustard ranch
pretzels sour
and cashews in mustard breadsticks great
timing because that frickin starving
right now
mm-hmm all right so I'm going to go on
to Instagram and answer some of your
guys questions I haven't read through
any of these yet let's see those cat
shoes are amazing
I don't even like cashews I'm just gonna
be starting on the top
alright so Queens the brie Nexo says
that she follows me on snapchat and the
other day I did a video getting items to
organize my makeup can I do a video on
that so if you haven't been following me
on social media I moved into a new
apartment and hence a new backer it's
good just choking on a pretzel I moved
into a new apartment had some new
background situation I got the Alex 9
drawer units I got like the big ones and
so I had to get tons of little storage
containers which are currently just
piled under my desk so once I can get
those frickin IKEA things assembled
shouldn't like get up all the wine and
do it I am gonna be doing a video on
organizing I might even include that in
a vlog so yes I'm also gonna be doing a
full like room tour makeup - or whatever
all that stuff once it's done it just
all takes time Jessica caps James says
what's your relationship status single
taken it's complicated spill some dirt
girl I am single as a literally nothing
right - a single
yeah I'm single if you know anyone in
the Seattle area I feel free to help a
sister out I went through a period where
I was just going on tons of tinder dates
I'm going on a date in a while I'm just
so busy with two jobs that I charred for
me to meet people who I like this
question what's your favorite must-have
item to buy at Trader Joe's
that was a really hard question I like
so many things from care dress mostly
the frozen food section in particular
purchase kilted up frozen treat to
probably try another snack oh that's so
freakin cute once you finish the puffs
there's a little patch of grass so
that's some good cattle current pops
sweet and salty popped corn kernels
whoa what do these taste like this
tastes exactly it's like something but I
can't can't put my finger on it no I'm
just like peanut Bart I may eat this
entire thing
where'd you get your earrings I'm not
sure which ones you mean my usual black
ones I got our old navy like two years
to go and I haven't been able to find
them again and mine are like broken
which is why I don't wear that these
studs are from Old Navy well Nene has
good earring how come you don't share
your last name on the internet I don't
really feel a need to I like to keep
parts of my life private my first last
name is not my brand a lot of people do
that now I just don't really feel the
need to Janelle Stacey says do you ever
plan on becoming just a full-time
youtuber and quitting your other job if
the opportunity came up came along
that's a really good question
and I would love to do YouTube full-time
but I also have career goals for myself
I have a lot of interest in other things
and just my career and holes for myself
I don't think I would ever be a hundred
percent satisfied doing just YouTube my
life would be a hell of a lot easier
I'll tell you that much I don't know who
knows if I was in like a bad place with
my job where I wasn't happy or something
maybe but I really love my job right now
no but in the future maybe what's your
all-time favorite makeup brand drugstore
I would probably have to say Revlon and
Maybelline so they just come out with
like some of the best products
especially for drugstore foundations
high-end I don't really have a favorite
high-end brand I just like a bunch of
random products that I've tried not that
into high-end makeup but if there's
certain products that like people rave
about I gotta get him what's your
favorite black hair dye I always switch
it up I kind of just buy whatever looks
good when I'm at the drugstore the one
that I use last time which I really like
is the Clairol it was like a blue-black
by Clairol and I really liked that one
and it's light you can't really tell but
outside it definitely looks like a good
blue-black a normal one is usually the
Revlon color silk oh hell yeah spicy
sriracha crunch throughout your peas and
popped corn kernels I might be moving to
Seattle soon do you rack up do you
recommend it as a city to live in I
usually get really antsy and kind of
bored after I'm in a place for the same
oh-whoa just messy
holy sees these they're good they
definitely have a kick to him the left
corner of my tongue right now is like on
fire now mostly it's like chili powder I
love Seattle I think it is the greatest
city I
loved it how did you embrace your
paleness / stop tanning so I have a
whole video on how to love your pale
skin it basically explains my entire
learning to love at your skin journey so
I will link it over here if you click
the I if you're on mobile or on desktop
it'll go to that video yeah it explains
every datum are you still recording
being a pale princess on a budget is
hard what do you recommend that has the
lightest shades I think that's kind of a
misconception that a lot of people have
is that only high-end makes pale enough
shades probably nine out of the ten
foundations that I use are from the
drugstore I'm going to be making a whole
video on my favorite drugstore
foundations for pale skin but the one
that I'm currently obsessed with is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation in
the shade 110 ivory this is light enough
I love it it has great coverage it stays
on all day literally this is what I wore
when I was in Atlanta last week and it
lasted through the insane freaking
humidity this is like a lifesaver
what all-over face powder do you use for
setting foundation lately I've really
been liking the Laura Mercier loose
setting powder in translucent people
raved about this stuff and I think it is
totally worth the rave it is a little
pricey so get the travel version which
is what I do with a lot of high-end
stuff because you never know smooths
over your foundation is translucent
literally makes this stay on all day the
only thing is that I can't tell if it's
causing me to get like these little
bumps they're not it's not acne he's
just like texture on my skin I can't
tell if it's this or not oh hell yeah
banana caramel dippers banana shortbread
with caramel sauce
it sounds so freakin good I wish I could
just save these does I really want to
bring these to work I'm starting college
next month do you have any tips
recommendations for dealing with first
year hardships and getting the most out
of your experience I had a incredible
freshman year of college I like
literally just got the goose bumps just
like thinking about it it is such an
unreal time in your life there's
literally nothing like it I would say
like make a list of stuff that you want
to do do stuff every single weekend make
the most of it go to all the freshmen
like events push yourself to get out of
your comfort zone because truly the
people that you meet freshman year of
college are the ones that are gonna be
your friends for the rest of college my
best friend Rachel who's in Seattle and
I've lived with two the last five years
I met her randomly because she was my
roommate freshman year of college he
exhausted like go do things because
freshman year is just like such a unique
experience how did you land your
marketing job so I have a whole video on
how to get a job after college that
video really helps to explain sorry
these smells so good oh my BOB these are
heavenly we just have a moment of
silence I'm gonna down these in like two
seconds best full-coverage foundation
that lasts all day now it's from amber
six six nine five oh I have a lot Revlon
Colorstay whipped Revlon Colorstay
maybelline superstay which isn't pale
but it works if you don't have pale skin
l'oreal infallible Pro matte foundation
is amazing those are like the ones that
first come to mind I'm going to
cosmetology school but I have no
interest in cutting hair or doing nails
how do I become a makeup artist I don't
consider myself a makeup artist I'm not
a makeup artist I just do makeup for fun
but I did work at Mac for almost a year
I didn't have any like formal training
or anything so I would say just practice
like watching YouTube videos practice
and we just died but we're back when I
was in high school I used to like sit on
the floor and do makeup for like four
hours and I was because I enjoyed it
it's like anything like it doesn't come
overnight it's all up to you work make
it happen you know I'm saying
Taylor Cox says would you rather have a
lifetime supply of burritos or makeup
well that is the hardest question ever
unlimited supply
probably makeup because makeup more
expensive burritos though what advice do
you have for girls that are just
starting out on YouTube I've been
meaning to make a whole video on this
for probably a year I would say don't
try to compare yourself to other people
do you and do it because you want to do
for the right reasons a lot of people
come in to YouTube and blogging now
because I think it's an easy
to make money people that are successful
on YouTube I think are themselves and
they do it because they enjoy it if you
start out thinking that's going to be an
easy way to make money or whatever
you're not gonna have enough like
motivation and persistence to actually
succeed YouTube takes a ton of
dedication so it has to be something
that you enjoy doing and that you are
okay with spending 10 to 20 hours a week
on at least have you ever tried Proactiv
if so what are your thoughts
I did try Proactiv in high school I also
tried to again sophomore year of college
a couple of the products worked well for
me but my skin got really used to it and
it just kind of stopped working the
routine that I found now is like my
perfect acne routine so that will be
coming up soon when you first started
YouTube did you see yourself ending up
where you are now or was it more of an
escape I'm not sure if you mean like an
X cape from what was going on in life I
definitely did not see myself where I am
now I remember having this one
conversation with my mom when I was at
like 15,000 or something she made us
even like when you hit a hundred and I
was like I'm never what like I'm never
hitting a hundred thousand like that's
funny and now I'm like almost there and
it's just crazy to me I never really did
it as an escape I did it because I was
really passionate about it I love
filming like I love talking to you guys
I love everything about YouTube it makes
me really happy so that's why I started
it and that's why I continue to do it I
also think back to the other question
like if I did YouTube as my full-time
job I wouldn't want it to be something
that I ever didn't enjoy doing whose
makeup have you always dreamed of doing
that's a good question no one I can
think of like on YouTube but I was
looking people in real life and I'm like
I would love to do a smoky eye on you
you have a great high structure is your
family supportive of your YouTube career
absolutely when I first started YouTube
my parents would kind of like joke about
it and whatever my family didn't really
understand at all when you start turning
it into like a job and you're actually
making income off of it people start
taking it seriously and it's a really
weird thing this is like I've been doing
this for almost three years now I think
it's just funny seeing people's
reactions change but my family is a
hundred percent supportive of it I think
awesome Sammy slaughter says was there
any specific youtubers that inspired you
to do what you do today
absolutely Channing so was a big one
I've been watching Shannon since she had
30,000 subscribers she's probably my
number one like YouTube role model just
because her work ethic is so amazing she
consistently puts out high quality
videos her full-time job but she doesn't
you can tell like that the passion
hasn't gone away like she's still really
excited about what she does she's
created a brand for herself and she's
just someone that I completely look up
to and have so much respect for these
Cornette P things sriracha things are
like growing on me Irby breadbasket
Basel baguettes garlic crostini and
oregano rice crackers mmm oh that tastes
like pesto do you like being small or do
you ever wish you were taller I really
like being short I don't think there's
ever been a moment when I would have
rather been taller only when I'm trying
to like reach something on the top shelf
if you were to be in a movie
what would the movie be about Lola I
would never be in a movie ever
I'm never gonna be one of those
youtubers that like turns into like a TV
person or whatever no I do not like
being the center of attention like in
front of people that would happen
alright the battery is about to die so
we're gonna wrap this up and I feel like
it's been pretty long already if you
guys liked this video give it a thumbs
up so I know let me know if you want
more Q&amp;amp;A video things and freaking
obsessed with breeze and I will
definitely be continuing and I have
