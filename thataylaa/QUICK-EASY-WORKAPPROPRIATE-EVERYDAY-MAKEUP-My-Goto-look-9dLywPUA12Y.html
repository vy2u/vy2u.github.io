truck goes bag
all right so today I thought I would
just do a easy casual get ready with me
kind of thing for just going out in the
world this is just kind of everyday
casual work appropriate I'm about to go
to a coffee meeting right now so I
thought I would just get ready with you
guys this is pretty much my go-to look I
can do this face in about 20 minutes on
a bad day 15 on a good day so it's just
quick easy I don't have to think about
it let's do this if you enjoy this video
while you're watching don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the burrito family and
subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time let's get
into it if you want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching I got a remote and this is
life-changing step 1 it is so nice
outside today's is like hello
distracting
okay so I've already washed moisturize
and primed I'm still trying out
foundations for 15 days of foundation
these are all pre-recorded so I'm going
to be mixing the Tom Ford waterproof
foundation with derma call to 0-8 just
because I want this one to have a little
bit more coverage I love how this lasts
and stuff throughout the day on its own
but I've tried mixing it I want to say
it twice now and it hasn't held up as
well as it did on its own some peers to
see how it does with derma call I'm just
gonna try blending this out with a
sponge stomach is growling oh I love
mixing foundations because you never
know how it's gonna turn out it's like
always an exciting surprise I'm saying I
still need to do that video on my best
foundation cocktails that combo is
looking pretty good it's matte but not
super flat or concealer this is just
always my go-to like everyone else on
the planet is tart shape tape in the
shade fair I wish it was a little bit
more pink toned once I run out of this
one I kind of want to try a different
shade and see if I can find one that's a
little bit more pink this one is quite
yellow lately I've been just liking to
blend this out with a sponge so I'm just
gonna use the tip of this morphe sponge
and I just bring it on the eyelid to the
skies are like this guy is Elvis guys
this guy is like bright blue today I
think when you guys are seeing this I'll
be in LA for a wedding I'm also going to
be going to the Southern California
tourism
family to set my under eyes it makes
these two physicians formula powders
I'll have the exact ones linked down
below along with everything else I'm
putting on my face these are just my go
to have been for years whoa where are
you going lash so my face actually
doesn't feel super tacky so I'm not
gonna set my face today I'm just gonna
go in for contour and blush and
everything I've been obsessed with this
Smashbox contour palette you guys will
see this or have already seen this in my
race and rejects video this shade right
here I love actually wait don't do
browse to browse for us actually so what
I'm just doing my clicker everyday kind
of makeup I first go in with the Ulta
brow tint in the shade deep and this
just adds color super quickly and then I
just go in with some kind of gel eye
brow product just to fix the shape a
little bit funny too but this if you are
in a rush using like a tinted brow gel
is just super quick takes like 2 seconds
if you want more natural brows you could
just leave it at that but I'm just gonna
go in with this benefit Cobra Oh doesn't
like just went down I've been filming
with naturally all the windows open so
now I like I actually have to deal with
the Sun I'm just gonna add a tiny bit
wherever I needed just to fix the shape
a little bit and I'll just bully up the
front a little bit and that's it that's
like 22nd brows right there
alright now let's do the rest of the
face again Smashbox contour palette I
love this flower beauty brush so soft
and just blend everything out really
well did Walmart stop caring flower
beauty in store or am I just imagining
that for blush I'm gonna go in with the
Physicians Formula butter blush and
vintage woah Rouge just like a nice
peachy pink okay this thing is like the
key to life right here I'm convinced
been using and talking about this thing
for years but it's still one of my Holy
Grail products Physicians Formula
natural nude shimmer brick you can use
these as eyeshadows they are gorgeous as
a highlighter I'm just gonna swirl these
light is for right here now before I do
the eyes I'm gonna go with the Too Faced
hangover RX three and one setting spray
I love
this time just settles everything makes
your highlight pop like I've talked
about this ten billion times recently
and it smells amazing like coconut soda
prime you guys have been using the
essence tune one eye shadow primer this
is very similar to the mac paint pot it
doesn't cover quite as well as the Mac
Paint Pot so if you have lots you like
to cover up on your eyelids you might
like that one better but this one does
serve as kind of a nice base and it
brightens and she's gonna make a shadow
pop since it is a little bit lighter
it's like a white color does anyone else
get really excited opening up the new
thing wipes I started saving my empties
again
aka trash so I'll probably have an
empties video coming in a few months he
should always do those and I kind of
stopped so I'm gonna first go back into
the same contour shade you can use
whatever contour shade you used I almost
always do this if I'm just doing a quick
makeup look because it's already out you
don't have to think about it and it
always works so I'm just blending this
into the crease this brush is the morphe
m5 11 so what I use every day I use this
the other day and I really like this
shade so I won't try it again this is
the L'Oreal 300 matte these are so soft
so I'm just gonna put this right on the
lid if you want to warm it up at all or
just add a little bit more definition
you could just use a smaller blending
brush and go in with like your bronzer
or something
this shade 304 is really nice as well or
if you have this palette you could go in
with this shade but I'm just gonna take
the l'oreal one right into the crease
just to define it a little bit more I'm
like really Russian I would probably
only put this shade on my eyes or did
the first two steps and skip this one so
if I didn't already have lashes on I
would go into my two favorite mascaras I
love these layered Too Faced better than
sex mascara and not the waterproof
version the normal one and then I like
to layer it with the Catrice glam and DA
mascara this is awesome because it just
kind of separates it a little bit more
and add some length but because I have
lash extensions on I'm just gonna go in
with my Wet n Wild mega length mascara I
love this for the bottom lashes doesn't
transfer down to my concealer or
anything
okay literally right as my camera
stopped recording I poked myself in the
eye ball with mascara so that was fun
just put the jacket I'm gonna be wearing
on because I feel like I looked totally
washed out so for lips you guys can
probably guess what's coming this has
been my go-to this is the L'Oreal
infallible mattes in the shade
tongue-tied
love this thing this one totally drives
down Matt it's not like the other the
new L'Oreal formula when I used in the
full drugstore video that formula I do
not like but this one's like a normal
liquid lipstick it just dries down
totally matte sometimes they'll mix in a
little something on tops I think I'm
gonna add some of the wet and wild
liquid catsuit in the shade nudie
patootie this is another one might go
twos if I want a little bit lighter and
like a cool toned but I'm just gonna put
this right on top I don't like to bring
it all the way out because I still want
the dark kind of blinding it feel like I
need a tiny bit more warmth on my face
right now so I'm just gonna go with the
Physicians Formula super ready instead
no insta ready super BB just gonna add a
tiny bit like with this tan shirt I just
look kind of washed out okay it just
popped on a choker but I think that is
it super quick easy when I'm not filming
and just doing this it takes me max
about 20 minutes so hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful
if you did don't forget to give this a
thumbs up let me know down below what
your kind of go to everyday lip color is
because I love finding different nude
variations like this and I probably need
to start wearing something other than
tongue-tied that's a point
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
