all right so today I'm gonna be showing
you guys my everyday makeup routine if I
am on a mission and I am in it to win it
I can do this in about 15 minutes I
would say
ten minutes if I have really good pump
up music on and lots of coffee this is
just chill kind of get ready with me as
I normally would got the coffee
malory actually made me this beanie and
I'm in love with it so if you guys are
excited for this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up all the products I'm
talking about can always be found down
below in the description box so if you
want to see how I get this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right so I've already washed my face
I usually go in with my anti blemish
matte primer but this thing is like
pretty much totally empty there's
actually a slit in the bottom of here
that squirts on the wall every time I
squeeze it out so that's one so lately
instead I've been using the Becca
backlight priming filter this makes you
super fricking glowy so if you're not
down for that you probably wouldn't like
this but I like the consistency of it it
gives a little bit of stick to it so it
feels like it's actually doing something
but it just makes your skin look super
glowy and healthy and it smells like
lemon and since the foundation I'm going
to go in with is a little bit more on
the matte side this just gives a nice
glow underneath what is it Maya what am
i doing foundation you guys are probably
sick of hearing about the foundation but
I've just been in love with it lately
this is the pur cosmetics bear doll
foundation I have a whole foundation
Friday video on this product I'm just
totally in love with it full coverage I
don't have to set it with a powder the
shade is nice on me stays throughout the
day doesn't get super oily on me at all
my favorite brush to apply it with is
this elf brush this is technically a
powder brush but I love using this elf
brush for foundation I'm having exact
one link down below along with
everything else and talking about your
cosmetics actually emailed me to give me
a coupon code for you guys because a
bunch of you have purchased this if you
buy the self a pur cosmetics website you
can get 20% off with the code Taylor
that code obviously doesn't work on Ulta
just on the pure cosmetics website
where's my beanie going without the
Becca primer this definitely looks more
matte so if you don't want the glow you
can just do a different primer smells so
freakin good and I don't think this
foundation has broken me out any more
than usual if you're new here I've
combination skin just to give you guys a
bit of an acne update I am still
planning on going on accutane I had to
work out
stuff with my insurance and just timing
with other things going on waiting until
after I go to China so I probably won't
go on accutane until around June just
because you have to do a ton of blood
tests and it's just a big commitment and
everything flared you do so concealer
that I use pretty much every single day
in my life is the Tarte shaped aid
concealer this one is actually almost
totally out this is in the shade fair I
feel like I don't know if the brand is
ever going to be able to top this
concealer even when I reach for my Urban
Decay Naked concealer now which I used
to love I still love it's a good
concealer it's just not quite up to this
level the brush I always use to blend it
out is some more Fiji 38 brush like I
always say with Murphy there are certain
brushes I recommend there are others I
don't just like any brand there are good
products and it's not so good products
this is one a few concealer brushes I've
ever found that I feel like actually
helps give me coverage it doesn't take
anyway when i'm blending it out and put
a tiny bit of this on the center of my
face kind of feeling it so i just
sprayed the victoria secret loves me
more I think it's called smells so good
getting with take they actually might
have discontinued that it's going to
cover up some of the acne on my neck it
has not been going away lately I love
how the more this foundation is on it
just kind of like melts into your skin
and warms up to it and it just doesn't
look cakey or heavy at all but you get
really great coverage someone is
vacuuming the whole way right now hope
you guys can hear that so to set my
under eyes I always go to my stargazer
powder this is just a white pressed
powder it's literally white it is not
translucent I'd only recommend this if
you have fair skin because it is going
to add a bit of color under there
but if you struggle finding a powder
that's actually light enough that will
help brighten your under eyes try this
one out this is like 5 bucks on Amazon
I've gotten through 5 billion of these
so with this foundation I actually like
how it looks better without a setting
powder on my skin with a setting powder
it kind of kicks up a little bit and it
just lasts really well on its own so
there's no reason for a powder and it
does set down a bit so it's easy to
blend stuff on top of it so I always
give it a few minutes to set and go in
for my brows I have permanent brows this
is like one of my most frequently asked
questions I do have permanent brows I
have a whole video on it
I go to Perry at fine line Studios which
is in San Diego she is amazing she did
my brows I love them I still like to
fill them in a little bit just because
when I put on Sunday
sometimes it can kind of cover it up but
I love having them because when I'm not
wearing a full face of makeup my brows
are totally on so lately this brow
combination is what I've been doing
every single day this is the what brand
is this this is the benefit precisely my
brow pencil this is in the shade for
eyeball timing issues today I could
probably go a shade up in this but I use
this eyebrow gel to kind of add a little
bit of darkness to it and I can't see
what I'm doing to this mirror super far
away basically just kind of outline the
shape that I already have I usually
leave the front kind of without product
on it because I like the look of lighter
in the front if I'm trying to get out
the door half the time we'll just put on
this brow gel this is the ultra brow gel
why does that sound weird yeah brow gel
in the shade deep I've used this thing
for years I love this usually if I'm
doing a full-on makeup look I'll carve
out my brows with concealer just kind of
clean it up a bit but for my everyday
kind of makeup I just usually don't take
the time to do that but that usually
gives my face a couple minutes to set so
we are good to start blending on top of
it now I forgot to say my under eye
brush is also by elf my under eyes are
weird some brushes and powders totally
take away the coverage so this one just
doesn't places the powder really nicely
so contour slash bronzer and highlight
are the things that I pretty much switch
up every single day I have my like ten
kind of go to products so I'm just using
one that I've used for a while and that
I really like this is the Ulta blush in
Sun glow if you have more fair skin and
you like that kind of reddish bronze
look this blush will do it for you and I
just use my wet and wild contour brush
it just gives warmth to my skin without
looking super orange and I always like
to kind of stipple on my powder products
first and then kind of blend just so I'm
not blending away any of the liquid
foundation I'm so it's a tiny bit of
this on my nose just to kind of warm up
my face a little bit well actually have
pretty much been sticking to either the
Physicians Formula butter blushes or my
all my nude mod blush so today we can
use the natural glow shade is a marquis
Wi-Fi brush for this is from the gold
collection obviously schooled this one
is really nice and subtle and it's hard
to kind of go overboard with this blush
in my opinion this blush as you can see
does have a bit of a glow to it kind of
has like a gold glow and I go in with a
powder brush this is just the e one and
just kind of blend that out so highlight
this is one of my favorite highlight
shades of life
this is the essence eye shadow in zero
one snowflake if you don't have pale
skin you can use the shade apricot ax
but these are shadows that are awesome
at highlighters I mentioned this tons
before but it doesn't give you that
gross glitter it's just a really nice
kind of blow em 5/10 brush and most days
when I'm just running out I don't like a
super intense highlight so I'm just
using kind of light hand with this
I'm added 10 times on an everyday basis
I just use whatever shade I used for my
bronzer contour I use that for my eye
shadow so I'm going to go in with the
Ulta blush again and I'm going to take
that you 27 brush just put that
literally straight into the crease most
bronzers work totally fine as eyeshadows
and it's just one less thing that you
need to think about and grab out of your
drawer
sometimes I don't put anything on my
eyes I'll just go in with mascara and
skips eyeshadow all together and on an
everyday basis I haven't been using
eyeshadow primer because I put my
concealer onto my eyelids if you don't
do that a primer might be a good option
but for me mine stays on totally fine
using the Tarte shape tape then for the
lid color I either won't put on anything
or I'll just use my finger and going
with whatever shade I used as a
highlight I mostly just do this so I
don't get any kind of creasing from the
concealer and my mascara doesn't
transfer anything if you have issues
with your mascara transferring to your
lids or your liked brow bone make sure
you have it set with some kind of powder
it's not going to transfer as much onto
powder as it is onto like a sticky kind
of liquid consistency
sometimes I'll bring this onto the inner
corner to those combine take about 30
seconds and just make you look way more
put together than you actually are
so I set my face with setting spray
every single day I just can't go without
it I love setting spray have a bunch of
different favorites but right now I'm
using the Catrice prime and fine
long-lasting setting spray I like this
one I feel like it doesn't alter the
finish of my foundation a whole lot
let's attempt not to take a shower on
this if you're someone who does set your
face with the powder after your
foundation this can help to just kind of
smooth everything out and get rid of
that texture and cakiness a bit kind of
just settles the liquid and the powder
together my holy grail mascara is like I
have to take up the Too Faced better
than sex mascara and a wet mild mega
length for the bottom lashes I think
I've literally use this for a couple
years now mascaras on those things that
people have such different opinions on
so I think you just have to find one
that works for you and your lashes and
this is just me but I feel like if I
wear lash glue the day before my
eyelashes aren't as nice next morning so
I feel like we're not going to have a
good mascara day but we're going in what
already got on my lid real life so if
you get your mask you're on your lid
just wait for it to totally dry down and
then you can go in and rub it off and it
won't smudge or anything look at that
difference no mascara versus mascara
crazy so for the past I would say like
six months I haven't been wearing a
whole lot of eyeliner I really like
having to totally put together face and
then going more natural on the eyes I
think it just kind of balances itself
out for everyday makeup especially in
Seattle you have a full face of makeup
on in Seattle people look at you like
you're from another planet like they've
never seen lipstick or eye shadow before
but you do you you know if you want your
eyes to look a little bit bigger make
sure you get those outside lashes right
here so it's good for the bottom lashes
wet and wild meg Lange has a superfine
like comb wand on here so it's just
really great for getting on your lower
lashes doesn't transfer down to the
bottom
pretty sure I get the waterproof version
I switch between them but I think this
one is waterproof lately personally I've
been really into the super super nude
almost dead kind of nude lipstick so I
have two that I've been reaching between
this is the Sephora liquid lipstick in
the shade 32 I don't think I've talked
about this on youtube yet but I mention
this a ton on snapchat this shade is
perfection if you are fair and you want
it super super nude liquid lipstick I
also really like the wet and wild make
alas liquid katsu in the shade nudie
patootie this one is a little bit more
taupe what am i feeling today let's go
know this to 4:01 today I always get
questions about how I put on liquid
lipstick with my lip ring so here we go
we're doing it in this video with the
outer parts I kind of do one swift
motion which is how I get clean line so
make sure you have enough product on
your wand so with my lip ring I let this
dry a bit so that when I push over the
lip ring it doesn't get it look a
lipstick all over it and all I do is
literally push it over use the very tip
of whatever wand I'm using and just
filled in that's it it's all I do magic
it's probably too new for some people
but this is just what I've been into and
what I've been doing so I hope you guys
