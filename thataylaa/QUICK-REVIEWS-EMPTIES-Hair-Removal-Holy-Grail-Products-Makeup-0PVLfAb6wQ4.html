video I like to do these because I like
to give you guys kind of like small
reviews on things that I may not talk
about otherwise read at all have like 10
videos after film right now but I feel
like this took priority because it was
no longer a bag of empties it was like a
corner of the room of empties so I have
a whole bag of I have a whole half
of a sparkly cupcake
of other stuff let's start with this
perfect up piece all right so first
thing I have this is neat spray-on cream
hair remover you guys know I'm all about
the hair removers I have a lot of it
consider myself a bit of a Hair Remover
connoisseur I've tried the cream version
of this the shower version of this the
Nair stuff waxing sugaring all that good
stuff I really like this stuff I
basically use this stuff either when I
haven't shaved my legs in a while you
don't have a boyfriend problems or on
the bikini area it's a pretty freakin
good job of taking everything off if you
need a good hair remover I would
recommend trying this one out I also
like this because it is spray form so a
lot lighter it's not like a thick cream
so it won't like clog your shower
anything yeah like this so we have
another shower product this is white
rain for men body wash you guys know I
like my man body watches I usually use
the axe one that doesn't really smell
like the guy it's like the pink one I
mentioned in another empties video that
Dollar Tree and I was feeling a little
cheap so we're with the white ringing
this is one of those body washes that
doesn't really like just goes by really
fast because it's there's something
about it you know I mean it smells good
dollar a man body wash next I tried out
this new Clairol expert hair dye this is
in the shade three black it has Pantene
on here so I was thinking it would make
my hair like really shiny and Fantini
like 19 usually does I like on my hair
looked afterwards it did feel shiny and
nice and soft but it definitely did not
last as long as my normal Revlon color
so pure die this faded way faster I have
to dye my hair like badly right now
hence the headband the Revlon stuff
frickin stings in but even with my roots
go out the rest of my hair is
you still black this one kind of just
like fade it everywhere so I won't be
repurchasing this next I have the Loreal
ever pure sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner this is the rosemary mint
scent I freaking love these shampoo
conditioners I repurchase them on you
know probably like five or six times now
these are the best shampoo and
conditioners I've ever found
bonus points is sulfate free which means
that if you dye your hair it won't strip
your hair of its color most sulfate free
shampoos do not lather this one feels so
nice and conditioning and lathering and
amazing assortment this stuff then we
have Revlon Colorstay in 110 I agree
this is like I cleared this thing out
you guys know this is like one of my
favorite all-time favorite foundations
110 actually is a little bit too pasty
white for me my favorite thing lately is
to mix this in with elf acne fighting
foundation or the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous and pull video on that like my
foundation routine using this right now
this is one of those foundations that I
just always find myself going back to
just amazing coverage lasts all day
doesn't break me out is light enough
everything I could ever ask for
then we have these equate makeup remover
wipes these are supposed to be
comparable to the Neutrogena ones that
are like my Holy Grail makeup wipes
they're not I think these are like three
dollars or something versus five dollars
at Walmart five or six dollars
Neutrogena wipes are freaking expensive
the Neutrogena ones just are something
that's worth the money to me these
aren't bad like if you're just looking
for an all-over face wipe they do the
job just the material that fog isn't as
soft and for my eyes they don't remove
the waterproof eye makeup as well as
Neutrogena does but if you don't use
wipes for your eyes then I think these
are great alternative you're kind of
like tug on my eyes and they were just
harder to remove the makeup next time I
will be going back to my you to Jeana
wife sorry now we have this whole guy
shirt first we have to do de RINs these
are the lady speed stick and powder
fresh nothing too exciting this is just
what
use you can get it from Dollar Tree
that's where I get it I like these I
always go back to these and there I
don't this is how long I've had these
empties sitting here I do have a
Neutrogena wipe that have also gone
through again my favorite kind of
already talked about these suave dry
shampoo this is the keratin infusion one
I have tried a few of the swab dry
shampoos they are my favorite be aware
that if you have dark hair sometimes you
might get a little bit of the white but
you just rub it in and it goes away it
smells good it works amazing like this
thing actually works and it's probably
the cheapest dry shampoo that I've come
across they always end up going back to
this one I don't know why I even kept
this for an empties video bag for cotton
rounds that's about all I have to say
about that I know baby wipes this is the
shea butter scent from Target up enough
brand I like how these have this kind of
open and close thing lid once word I
don't know I always mix my foundation on
the back of my hand so I just like to
keep these on my makeup station to just
take it off and clean everything off
always have these I threw this in here
because it is empty and I don't know why
it was just sitting in my closet this
was probably from like over six months
ago when I was using Proactiv plus I
forgot to mention this in my acne update
video but I did go on Proactiv plus
senior year of college so over a year
ago now it really helped but then my
skin got really used to it and I started
breaking out again and I did like this
exfoliator probably won't be
repurchasing it just because I feel like
my Neutrogena one does an amazing job as
well yeah I send ir-2 makeup products
which I have finished this is the
Maybelline Dream wonder and ten
porcelain ivory and then the benefit
Porefessional I talked about these both
5000 times so I'm just going to go over
this super quickly love this stuff it's
amazing but it breaks me out same exact
thing with this if you want to know my
full thoughts on these I've talked about
it in my December race and rejects and
like 10 other videos another product
they talked about 5 billion times this
is my physicians formula eye booster in
ultra black this is my holy grail
eyeliner I'm using
for probably a year over a year year and
a half now I'm you know it is amazing I
use this in every single shouting
schmooze video so you've seen it in
action if you watch my videos if you buy
this make sure you buy the ultra black
shade not just the black shade because
the ultra black is where it's at then I
have a couple concealers the first is
the Revlon age defying concealer in the
lightest shade I love mixing this with
my NYX lavender concealer the HD
concealer mixed together they have a
perfect amount of coverage and
consistency I do like this by itself but
it's just too dark for me the lightest
shade so if you don't have any LC and
you should be fine with just this on its
own I think it's a great drugstore
concealer next is the maybelline instant
age rewind again this is also way too
dark I love the consistency and formula
and creaminess and everything of this
concealers so I wish it wasn't too dark
whenever I use this I just put like my
white sit on a lace powder over top to
lighten up the under-eye so that's kind
of like a way to get around that but to
me it's like I might as well just use it
concealer that's actually light enough
for me you know I'm saying another one
of my Holy Grail Physicians Formula
products this is the mineral we're
correcting powder in the shade
translucent swish translucent I don't
know if there's a translucent and a
translucent light I definitely return
the translucent because I thought I
bought the wrong thing anyways this is
my favorite powder to set the under eyes
just everything you could ever want in a
setting powder for under the eyes if you
have paler skin than I do you can use
this as an all-over powder I've probably
gone through like ten of these at this
point next we have a beauty sponge I
don't know if this is technically
considered an empties but I'm throwing
it out so that's what I'm considering it
this is frickin disgusting I don't know
if you guys can see that but they're
like makeup full-on caked up on here let
me know if you have a good method for
washing your Beauty Blender because I
use like the Beauty Blender solid and
everything and my stuff just never comes
out of it I don't know what I'm doing
wrong this is the Real Techniques
makeups fun I've never tried the Beauty
Blender but I do love this thing it's
like six bucks or somewhere around there
if you like a really like kind of dewy
flawless face I recommend trying this
thing out
we have some toothpaste this is a crest
3d white luxe
toothpaste Inc I mention this in every
single empties video favorite toothpaste
makes your teeth really nice and white I
also use the crest 3d white strips which
I've been getting a lot of questions
lately about whether or not I whiten my
teeth and I do I use the crest 3d white
Trix few more products I think we're
doing good in this under like 15 minutes
Wet n Wild mega plump mascara this is
the waterproof version not a fan of this
I just had this sitting around so I was
using it for my bottom lashes the brush
is pretty freaking big so not ideal for
bottom lashes I love my wet and mild
custom the tens look I love my wedding
I'll make the length mascara just like
gets in your bottom lashes perfectly
because the bristles are so tiny won't
be repurchasing this lip so lip balm I
bought this because Holly east lipstick
is like obsessed with it and it probably
mentions it alright I love the mint eNOS
of this I probably repurchase this but I
do really love my Carmex lip balm that's
like my Holy Grail lip balm that I wear
every single night this is a good one
for me to like throw in your purse kind
of lip balm
the Carmex is like a really intense
overnight kind of thing I just quote
that shade on last product is dragons
natural glow medium to tan don't ask me
why I bought medium to tan ever this is
another one of the products like the
Proactiv where I was just sitting in my
closet pretty much empty
I don't tan at all anymore so I figured
there's no point in just keeping this
around it's probably expired anyway this
is from like over a year ago I don't
even know I used to be all about the
self-tanning and then I have a whole
video on us I'm not gonna go into it if
you want to know why stop self-tanning
I'll link my how to love your pale skin
video right here it goes in depth about
how I grew to like my pale skin so that
was everything I am so freakin excited
to go eat a burrito and also just to put
this in the recycle if you guys like
this video and you want more empties
videos be sure to give this a a thumbs
up so I know I do have I mentioned this
at the beginning I don't think so
I do have a whole video on the eye look
I'm wearing right now it is a
I like and review of the Pantone Sephora
palette I will link that down below if
you want to see that love you guys
thanks for watching see my next video
