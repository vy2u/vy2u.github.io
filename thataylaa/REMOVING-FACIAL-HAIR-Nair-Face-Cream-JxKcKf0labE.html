don't know why my first inclination was
to remove facial hair but we're doing it
all so props to the hard candy I shadow
primer you passed the inebriation
challenge I shadow still on so we're
just removing facial hair today casual
haven't even had coffee and me I don't
know what's going on right now we're
using the narrow moisturizing face cream
you can use this on your upper lip chin
and face I don't know why they feel they
need to say that all that is on your
face but this stuff is super easy to use
this is what I've been using to remove
facial hair if you're like me and have
peach fuzz or anything going on on your
face that you don't want going on this
stuff is amazing basically just put it
on like a normal lotion I usually go and
do like a first coat and then just apply
more wherever I need it if you have acne
I would recommend waiting until you
don't have like open pimples on your
face is that the right word because it
will burn a little bit basically just
apply this wherever you have hair that
you want to remove sometimes I'll go
look above my eyebrow and remove that
hair just to like clean everything up
but right now we're just focusing on the
peach fuzz and we really don't know what
I'm doing right now it is like 10:00 in
the morning
roommates are still asleep and I'm
removing facial hair welcome to my life
did I use a toner on my face before this
just to remove any leftover makeup from
last night not really supposed to rub
this in so I'm just kind of you know
applying more on the areas that need it
we're going to let it sit for about five
minutes and then wash it off so I just
wash my hands and now we're just going
to chill well this works it's magic
so this retails for about five to seven
dollars you can get at rite-aid CVS
Walgreens any drugstore pretty much I
have tried other hair removals I've
waxed my face I've done everything and
this stuff is the bomb once I use this
stuff I will be hair free for about a
week depending on how fast your hair
grows it might last longer or shorter
but it just lasts about a week on my
face you don't want to leave it on too
long and I would definitely recommend
having a clean face for the rest of the
day after I use this stuff I don't
usually put on any kind of foundation or
face makeup or anything like that so I
just washed off the Nair and my face
feels like a normal human being again it
completely removes all of your peach
fuzz or whatever hair you have going on
and now I'm going to use a gentle
moisturizer I'm using the oil-free
Neutrogena moisturizer and that is all I
do if you liked this video now it's
helpful for you be sure to click the
thumbs up button so I know and I'm going
to go make some coffee and attempt to
function love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
