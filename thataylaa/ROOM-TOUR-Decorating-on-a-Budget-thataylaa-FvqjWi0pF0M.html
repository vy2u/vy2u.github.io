filming the long-awaited room tour so
let's do this when you first walk into
my room this is what you see give you a
little overview here okay so I moved
into this apartment in August and I got
really into interior decorating and DIY
stuff and painting my own furniture and
all that so I'm just gonna kind of walk
you through everything and tell you
where it's from and what I did with my
room so when you first walk in here's
the door that I just opened and then
there's this like awkward thing behind
it because I didn't have anywhere else
to put it
so over here I have um like all of my
pants these are the ones I never really
wear like random ass colors these are
like yoga pants obviously you need five
thousand pairs and some jeggings in
there these are all my most used jeans
um and I have just two boxes with like
random clothes and then shoes down here
that I never wear and workout clothes
that I never used because I never
workout ever
then I have my printer up here it's the
Epson XP 200 it sucks don't buy it
wouldn't recommend it it always like
jams then I have this random like lamp I
think I got freshman year but then when
we back up this is what the bed area
looks like okay so let's start with this
I hope I'm not being too shaky right now
let's start with this guy right here so
the piece of furniture I picked up on
Craigslist for five dollars it was
really shitty ugly brown wood before and
I repainted it I have a whole video on
how to paint your own furniture and also
follow my Instagram which I will put
right here show you before and after
pictures of all the furniture I'm gonna
mention yeah painted this myself just a
little like nightstand thing then on top
I have this mirror that I got from the
thrift store and I also painted that
white I think I got it for like three
bucks the Christmas tree that I have
over here or the Hanukkah bush if you're
Jewish like me is from Target I think
it was like eight bucks and then all the
ornaments are also from Target except
for this like random ass tiara that I
put on that was from my Audrey Hepburn
Halloween costume and I was like why not
put it on the tree you know the rational
thing to do so here's the tree got some
little lights on there and then this
bird I got from Michaels which is a
craft store and then I'm burning
mahogany teak wood my favorite candle in
the world and what would a room tour be
without a bath and Bodyworks candle you
know it just wouldn't be one it
literally smells like Abercrombie man it
smells amazing anyways then we have this
perfume tray over here this I got from
home goods I want to say it was like 15
bucks 20 bucks
and then I have all my like most used
perfumes on here at home like not at my
college apartment I have a bunch of
other perfumes I'm a complete perfume
hoarder it's kind of an issue then over
here obviously we have fifty shades
darker because I'm addicted and that's
what I do with my life right now so the
flower vase is from the thrift store for
like 99 cents same with the flowers also
thrift store and these are obviously you
know fake roses so when you open this up
I don't even know okay yeah that is not
exactly organized but you know this is a
candid room tour people so I have these
two Betsey Johnson bags over here this
one has nail polish this is all of my
like random medication advil migraine
stuff then I have a bath and Bodyworks
candle over here sparkling eyes and just
like random books hair extensions that I
still need to review like a waxing thing
just paper random ass stuff in here and
then above this I have my army of
gingerbread men got to keep my men in
line you know what I mean these are from
Target in the dollar section
gotta love Target people which by the
way can we talk about how targets dollar
section isn't even a dollar anymore it's
like $3 and $5 come on
some of them even have eyelashes which I
didn't realize
until after I hung them I don't know if
those are supposed to be the girl
gingerbread women anyways they're really
cute and festive and I love them so over
here we have my bed clearly let's start
with the bed so I just have a bed frame
on the bottom of here there's no
headboard or anything and just have my
leg pills against the wall the black and
white bedding is from Walmart I know
right it's crazy and from like two years
ago but they probably still have it
because it's Walmart and I think I'm
going to get another one because I have
like I have this blanket on here because
there's like a coffee stain right there
because I'm really clean so um this
blanket I think is from Target the black
blanket and then over here we have this
sparkly grey pillow is from TJ Maxx and
then my actual bed sheets are the Jersey
bedding from Target then above my bed I
have kind of like random frames hung so
close up up these frames didn't really
change the picture that came in them so
I have a random couple over here who
doesn't love a random couple on their
wall it's inspirational look how happy
they look the only one that I did change
is this one this picture is of my
grandparents in when was that 1944 it
was a day after they got married this is
my favorite picture of my grandparents I
just think it's absolutely adorable then
coming on to this wall right here
both of these white shelves I got from
the thrift store and I painted them I
think each of them were like two dollars
so this um what's this called flower
vase is from the thrift store and then
these roses are from Joanne's craft
store and they're really cute because
they have like glitter on the ends this
shelf also from the thrift store this
little triangle pyramid clock kind of
thing is from the thrift store so is
this candle holder which I absolutely
love I think this is so pretty
and I just put a silver candle in there
and then these little flying birds up
here are from ebay link will be down
below I like it
because they have their mirrored so it
kind of follows the rest of the theme
going on and I needed something to put
like in this corner because everything
is so low because I'm so short and so I
needed something to like lift the eye up
if you catch my drift
then this rug down here I am in love
with it is from Etsy I'll put the seller
right here she has really reasonable
prices it is so freaking squishy and
comfortable I could sleep on this like
I'm pretty sure this rug is more
comfortable than my bed is a bunch of
different sizes and colors so definitely
go check out her Etsy page and let me
know what you guys think of the rug
right here I'm kind of like trying out
the positioning I've never had a rug
before so I'm like I don't know where to
put this square piece of fabric so then
I have this long length mirror which is
what I like get dressed in that's right
way to say that every morning and that I
actually found by the dumpster outside
and I was like yes I want a free mirror
why not when you come over here I have
well that was a really deep voice
jewelry hanger I guess which I made self
a lipstick swatch on from work yesterday
well I got the outside frame I guess
from Aaron Brothers and then I just
glued in cork board from Michaels which
I painted white man I used like pushpins
just to hang some of my jewelry then
coming over to the desk area same thing
flowers and bass are from the thrift
store here is my view all the snow just
melted off which is sad down in this
corner I have stuff that I'm gonna haul
in you to film badly I have like a whole
list of videos that I need to get up
like ASAP so the desk I got for $12.99
from Goodwill I have before and after
pictures on my Instagram so you can see
what it looked like before I painted it
but I painted the hardware and the whole
thing white and I just absolutely love
it
I think it's so pretty I love this kind
of like vintage look and then the stool
I also got from the thrift store for $3
it was really hideous before it was like
I don't even know like a 70s like
kitchen stool I painted the bottom white
also all this stuff is on Instagram so
you can see what everything looked like
before let's start with on
to the desk under the desk I just have
my freelance makeup kit and then this
black studded computer case which is
from ASOS and the makeup case is from
eBay I'll put the link below and then a
trash can super exciting so I'm not
going to go into an in-depth tour of
what is in my desk slash vanity it's
like a half vanity the upper drawers are
makeup and then the bottom two are like
actual desk stuff comment down below and
thumbs up this video if you want a whole
other vanity tour over here is basically
just my most used makeup like on a daily
basis this mirrored little drawer thing
is from TJ Maxx
I think TJ Maxx are home goods I don't
know about you people but I am literally
the messiest person in the world when I
put on my makeup it is not a clean
activity and it gets everywhere so I put
this white like placemat thing on top of
my desk and I when I'm doing my makeup I
try and keep everything in this region
so it doesn't get on the paint so then I
have all my brushes which clearly need
to be cleaned and it is in this Mac
brush holder which is from Etsy I did a
whole other video on it so I'll link
that below it's my brushes that I love
video or something like that
so then in this little contraption which
is a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle holder but
I found it at Goodwill for like $0.99 so
in here I have my Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray which feels exactly
like the normal Urban Decay
spray then I have this mirror over here
which I do my makeup in everyday brush
cleaner and I actually make my own brush
cleaner and I just put it in an old
Urban Decay setting spray bottle let me
know if you want a DIY brush cleaner
video comment down below have random
candles over here that I never light
they're just for looks I love this one I
think it was from TJ Maxx then over here
we have a coat hanger thing basically
just where I plop all of my random
we have some coats that I use on a daily
basis and then my Steve Madden purse
down here which is from TJ Maxx and then
just like random colored necklaces that
I never
beware but keep them up here to remind
myself that I have them and I need to
wear them and then I have some like hats
and headbands and stuff over here so
then coming into the closet area it has
this door but I never close it because I
don't know there's no point my closet
isn't very exciting to be honest there's
like five thousand jackets literally
only where these two right here I feel
like that's like the story of every
girl's life like have five thousand
things but only more two of them send
down here this stuff is basically
basically stuff that I bought and still
need to wear or I don't want to forget
about so I don't like fold it and put it
away then in here I have all of my shoes
I have like heels on this random thing
and then this white shoe rack I got from
the thrift store and these are just the
boots and shoes like up here that I wear
the most on top of my closet I just have
bright ass green containers from Target
and this is all my like Halloween slash
random clothes that I bought and was
like oh this would be cool to have that
I'll wear at some point and I still
haven't worn it like three years later
okay so moving out of the closet over
here is let's start with this this is
actually made this one and I'm selling
it on Etsy right now so if you're
interested and you liked the one that I
had hanging on the wall then you can buy
this one I'll link my Etsy page down
below okay so my dresser I got off
Craigslist for like 30 bucks which was
kind of pricey considering it was this
horribly ugly puke yellow color with
like chipping paint I had to like stay
on the top of it a lot before I painted
it but I painted it had to buy some more
hardware for it and now it's pretty and
white so this is where I keep the
majority of my clothes so on top of the
dresser it looks like this to give you a
little overview so let's start here here
I have my phone um it is the iPhone 5s I
was informed after my iPhone video so if
you want to see what's on my iPhone I
have a whole other video linked down
below this glass drawer thing I got from
home goods and it was like 20 bucks like
what a freakin steal
I just have random jewelry okay that's
why it was twenty books I just have
random jewelry and stuff in here and
then I keep this stuff on here pretty
much all the time I just really liked
this box it's a Nine West Love fury
perfume but I just thought the box was
really pretty and I like how it like
reflects against the mirror and then I
keep my Anne Klein watch right here just
mirror right here for when I do my hair
I need to see the back the mirror that
is above my dresser is from the thrift
store it was three or four dollars so
then the stuff over here so let's start
with this little jewelry hanger thing
right here I have a whole video on how I
made this so if you want to see that it
will be linked down below
it was my DIY first or fine video
basically just keep all of my like other
random bracelets and stuff over here I
don't really wear that much jewelry I
wear like the same earrings every day
and then I really like statement
necklaces so that's like what I have the
most of I'm not a huge like jewelry fan
in here I don't even know what's in here
like what is this oh this clone smells
so good is the Ralph Lauren Polo mmm
smells so good it reminds me of when I
was in Jordan because I swear like every
man there smelled like this I have my
lotion this is sensual amber from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works then we have some you know
pure romance coochie conditioning shave
cream no it is not only for your couch
you can use it on your legs or wherever
you shave you know it actually really
helps and it smells really good
it helps with like razor burn and all
that aftershave goodness then I have
whoa just like choked then I have urban
urban yes then I have herbal or okay
what sale then I have Herbal Essence
hairspray then I have my straightener
over here it is so old that it is
completely worn off the name it's the
remington straightener from Target and
it is honestly the best straightener I
have ever used it's like 20 bucks but it
works amazing and I've had it for
forever so it's not going to like die on
you and I use this to curl my hair
so because it has that like round end
this great thing which spins I got from
TJ Maxx and I just have the love fury
Body Lotion I love this thermal spray
it's amazing white light was by Bath and
Body Works opposed to get compliments
whenever I wear this one then I have my
teasing comb and then a lace by Victo
Victoria Secret and then some more bobby
pins and then in here I have this
hairspray which I got from Jordan and is
the best hairspray I've ever used in my
life but I don't want to use it every
day because I'm scared that I'll run out
of it and I just have that in this black
like mirrored thing and this is from
Joanne's fabrics as well this mirrored
candle tray I think is from oh god I
don't even remember I don't know where
that's from this is from Michaels like
two years ago they had them everywhere I
saw them at Joanne's also it's always
there during like Halloween season I
obviously never light it's just for
looks and it smells like absolute
then over here there's the heater
super-exciting thermostat light switch
and then I keep these notes because
they're really cute they're for my
roommates oh I think that was everything
