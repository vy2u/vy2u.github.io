all right so today we have a room tour
I'm kind of embarrassed to say how long
ago I said I was filming a room tour
we're doing a whole room swap right now
looks back the other day and I actually
have more home videos and I thought I
did so I'm going to create a playlist
and I'll link it down below but if you
want to know kind of my like moving and
apartment or home hulls and everything
I'll put them all in a playlist so it's
easy to find if you saw the vlog when we
like first moved in here we have kind of
a unique living situation I have two
other roommates so there's three of us
living in a two-bedroom apartment I was
living in the living room we have this
like tiny officing that was technically
like my filming room slash makeup room
whatever so that was where you guys have
been seeing all of my videos filmed for
the past like eight months I don't mind
like weird living situations the only
thing in the reason why we're switching
is because I'm a super light sleeper so
every time my roommate has to walk in
and out to get to her room I wake up and
we have complete opposite work schedule
so timing wise it just wasn't working
out but everything else was fine
she could sleep if there was a
train going through her room so we're
gonna try and swap rooms when are we
swapping we're doing like a three-way
switch with the filming room as well
when I'm filming this intro right now
I've switched my bedroom into the small
room so I will be documenting this whole
swap and everything so make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss out on the
vlogs in the new room tour in the new
Beauty room tour and all that good stuff
since swapping rooms I've been sleeping
 great it's been fantastic so if
you want to see my room tour
aka how I lived in the living room then
you're in the right place just keep
watching all right so when you walk down
our hall this is kind of what you see
this is basically my wall these curtains
right here and then this is my room so
this is technically the living room I'm
going to be explaining all this in the
intro I assume this isn't going to be a
super in-depth room tour because I need
to start moving stuff but I did want to
show you guys the space since I promised
this video like months ago when I first
moved in these curtains are from Ikea
and we basically just tuck them into the
headboards because that's the only way
to get them up this rug I believe is
from TJ Maxx and just like a runner rug
I clearly am all about like the black
and white and grays I hate hate hate
this wall color my headboard I got from
Wayfarer and it's just full leather
white bed
I'll have the bedspread link down below
I don't actually remember where I got it
I'll have everything that I can link
down below the silver pillow is from
home goods the cross one is from Etsy I
think the black and white ones from Etsy
as well and then my cross sheets over
here which I'm obsessed with are from
Target over here in this corner we have
my quote-unquote light that isn't
working actually ran out of light bulb
like a month ago I keep forgetting to
replace it so basically I've been using
one of my studio filming lights to light
up my room because there's no light in
here the table that this is on is a
little nightstand from hot look it's
basically a mirrored nightstand I'll
have a link for hot look down below but
it's basically like a flash sale site
and you can get really good deals on
home decor stuff this little rope thing
is from Hobby Lobby Hobby Lobby actually
has really awesome home decor stuff I
literally didn't touch up anything this
is how my room looks pretty much 24/7 so
yes there's a TV monitor on the floor
that's life I don't know if I'm going to
show you guys my room I want you to see
it how it actually is so this is
actually a IKEA three drawer dresser aja
wood stain on the entire thing and then
I got these black crystal knobs which
are from Amazon I also got these gold
and corner things that I glued on I have
a whole video on repainting furniture I
haven't done one on wood staining and
stuff yet but it's pretty basic so on
top of the dresser we have this mirror
which is actually from the thrift store
we have drywall walls so it's super hard
to hang anything all the stuff was hung
by my dad when he came because I was
just not having good luck with this most
of the frames that you see are from
either TJ Maxx Ross or home goods that
painting is hung sideways but you can't
really tell if you're just looking at it
I don't know it fit better that way and
the fire alarm is right there and I like
to like the placement of it with the
colors so it's just chilling sideways so
super quickly on top of here I always
have a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle I kind
of just lay out my jewelry because
that's the only way I remember to use it
and then in these little drawer things I
have
my chapstick that I use every night
Carmex and then there's some like bigger
earrings in here it's moving on
so my desk area is pretty messy and not
exactly how I want it to be but this
white chair is from Amazon a link below
the desk is from ikea this computer i do
not use my dad was gonna give it away
and i was like I will take that I
thought I was going to do editing on it
it's literally too old for the iMovie
that I need so I'm just waiting to have
time to sell it over here is my perfume
tray I just have it on this little
mirrored tray from home goods I believe
and then some random like sunglasses in
this little clear thing that's from the
thrift store these are my like things
that I use everyday deodorant whatever
then here I have some extra journaling
and erin condren stuff here is my Erin
Condren planner I usually like to keep
it out on my desk just so I remember to
use it originally that was my nightstand
and I had all of my paint stuff in a
closet and this is just like a super
temporary place for it and I don't
really know where to put my paint the
painting above here I actually made I
have a whole DIY video on it I saw a
painting at Hobby Lobby that was like
$50 and so I made my own version of it
these are little hooks from H&amp;amp;M this is
my roommates door right now and that
goes into her room so she has to walk
through my room to get to her room here
we have my clothes this rack is from
Ikea and this is basically where I hang
my most used up half of my wardrobe is
black and then the rest of it I have
color-coded under here I have a little
basket which is like gold and polka
dotted and really cute and I got that
from Ross that is all like Erin Condren
planner decorating stuff I'm a hoarder
and then over here is my most recent
like DIY project this nightstand is
actually one that I repainted and I
found it outside literally by the trash
if you follow my Instagram you saw it
before and after shot of this this
lighting is really horrible right now
and I can't really do anything about it
in true light it's like a super pretty
light gray color have these roses on
here a candle a little mirrored tray
which is from the Dollar Tree up here
are some photos there's clearly one that
fell again I can't like nail things into
this wall so I just have them attached
with sticky adhesive squares which clear
didn't work very well so yeah this is
basically my room in this tiny room over
here that attaches that is where I film
so this is the room where I film I
wasn't planning on showing you guys this
in this video but I am going to be
moving my bed into this tiny ass room
this is kind of my setup right now I'm
not very happy with it
because it's really really small and
it's difficult for the camera to focus
on my face because as you can see this
wall is on a slant this desk I repainted
myself a couple years ago diva ring
light that I used to film have a little
jewelry thing up there and then this is
the background that you guys see in my
videos so that was everything I hope you
guys like this quick room tour love you
guys thanks for watching see ya my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
