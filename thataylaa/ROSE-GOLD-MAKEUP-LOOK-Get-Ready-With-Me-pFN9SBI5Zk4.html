thing going on on the eyes as a tutorial
or genre muse I don't know I do have a
whole other video on my face makeup
right now which is my everyday current
foundation routine so I'll leave that
over here and you can watch that first
if you want or I'll leave it in the
downbar
I'll do both if you want to see you this
I looked and you're in the right place
just keep watching I just filmed my
everyday current foundation routine
right here so I want to do like a rose
gold kind of smoky eye I think I've used
my Naked 3 palette literally two times
since I bought it like a year ago so I
figured we should dig it up and my glue
is literally glued up can't tell where
I'm in focus they're defining eyes I'm
using this cream gel by second loved
cosmetics this is a second look
yeah second level cosmetics this is a
kind of like a Paint Pot but I haven't
used this before it's a pinky shade so
we're using it so when you guys are
watching this I think it'll be right
after Christmas I am still home filming
this right now I'm trying to get a bunch
of videos up and ready for you guys to
go Fredi for you guys to get ready to go
for you guys so you have stuff to watch
over the holidays okay so we are just
going to start by taking the lightest
shade in the brow bar to gopala clearly
I like this shade I put pan this is a
perfect blending color for in the crease
I'm obsessed with it what was I talking
about holidays so basically like killing
myself editing like two videos every day
it's how much I love you guys I don't
know for me being consistent on YouTube
is something that I think is really
important
we're just London away over here so
usually I put down the lid pillar next
but I think we're actually gonna do like
the outer we dark shade right now so I'm
just gonna take this morphe like tiny
pointy brush and going in with the Naked
3 palette mixed feelings on this thing
I'm going to take black heart which is
the darkest shade does have a little bit
of like glitter red or pink glitter in
it which I'm not a fan of I'm just
literally drawing a v-shape on my outer
V I am dragging this a little
in words but not too far just enough so
when we go to blend on top of it it
won't be too difficult to blend out was
that just blurry the whole time
I really need to work on my camera setup
I'm just stoked for the ring light to
come it's dragging this inwards a little
bit on this side I'm gonna go in with my
Sigma laced Evo 9 brush and blend this a
little bit into the crease I'm just
blending everything together we just
want this to look super blended how many
times do you think we say blended in a
video I think my most used word is
alright I literally cut out about 50 all
right so when I edit ever see like an
abrupt cut to the next clip it's because
I said alright
alright so now everything is blended got
all of our dark shades on you can see
how I left this middle part of my eye
completely blank and that's where we're
gonna put the light rose gold shade so
for that I'm using trick which has a
shit-ton a fall out so I am gonna wet my
brush actually no first we're gonna go
in with strange which is this light
matte shade in the palette and I'm just
gonna put this under my brow bone maybe
this isn't matte this looks kind of like
set now I'm gonna go in with trick on
that same brush and I'm just patting
this in where are you guys that's weird
a little dirty I'm just patting this in
and then we're gonna spray Mario Badescu
rose water you can use water or setting
spray or whatever you have so I'm just
gonna pack this right on top
ooh this color is so pretty we don't
want to bring it too far over the black
but just enough where it's kind of
blended into it
cameras not even like picking it up like
it is in real life if you can feel all
out coming out spray it again alright I
just want to zoom you guys in a little
bit so you can see what's going on on my
eyeballs this shade is so pretty so next
I'm going to take nooner from the
palette where is it it's that one I'm
just gonna blend this on the bottom
lashline then we're gonna go back in
with black heart and just put this on
the outer 1/3 part of the bottom
lashline there's my words I just want to
go in with my Physicians Formula
eye booster eyeliner that I use
a single day of my life I'm just gonna
do a quick wing with this and I'll
probably be out of frame okay so I'm
gonna go in with some Urban Decay
perversion on the waterline you can just
use any black eyeliner that you have I
am sometimes waterline eyeliner just
makes such a difference let me go back
in with black part and just blend a
little bit more down there where my
falsies at they're not in the box so
once I find them I'm just gonna apply my
kiss me 0-3 lashes which are my favorite
and I do a lash adhesive brush on mmm
glue I had no luck finding my Kissin e03
lashes don't know where they were an
octave instead I use red cherry number
28 actually I think I like him on
bumbie's wet and wild to make a length
mascara this is like the perfect mascara
for bottom lashes because as you can see
the bristles are just super tiny and
just easy to get in there on the bottom
lash line so for lips I'm gonna do a
nude I'm gonna go in colour-pop
cosmetics lippies stick in the shade
skimpy this has been my favorite go-to
nude color lately and you don't need a
liner just go to town new smell like
cake make a look at how pigmented this
they also just feel amazing on your lips
just to warm that up a little bit I'm
gonna go in with my color pop no-drug
cosmetics sugar mama lip gloss favorite
lip gloss of all time alright so this is
the final look if you guys like this
video and you want more shadow diffuse
videos give it a thumbs up so I know
this consider a shadowing show you don't
know what I'm pulling this if you guys
recreate this look make sure you tag me
on instagram and tweet me a picture cuz
i want to see again I will leave the
face makeup down below so you can see
what I've been doing on my face every
day
love you guys same for watching and see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
