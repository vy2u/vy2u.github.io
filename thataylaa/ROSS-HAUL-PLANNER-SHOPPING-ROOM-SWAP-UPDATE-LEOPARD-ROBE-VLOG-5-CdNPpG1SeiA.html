three times all right so it is Saturday
and I thought that I'd blog because I
wanted to
so I'm actually doing a bunch of home
stuff today that I wanted to show you
guys if you saw my last room tour
I gave kind of a brief overview of what
is happening but basically I'm
completely switching rooms and so I'm
gonna be redecorating my filming room
and I'm super stoked I mean my roommate
just went to Ross on Aurora just a
freaking ghetto Ross but they always
have good stuff so the space right now
just how to show everywhere because
there's nowhere for me to move it this
was my old room and my bed is now in
this room this is where my bed is now
the bed is like against the walls but
it's actually really cozy and I've been
sleeping great and I'm pretty sure I'm
wearing the exact same thing that I was
wearing in the last leopard girl vlog so
at Ross I ended up getting two pairs of
curtains
these ones are more sheer and they have
little silver interlaced and then these
are gray and white so I think I'm gonna
put the gray and white ones on this side
of the wall just so I have privacy
because basically Rache is gonna be
moving in this room and she's gonna have
her bed in here so we're putting the
curtains up there and then back where
the blinds are right now that's where my
the sheer curtains are gonna go I just
booked a handyman guy on TaskRabbit
this isn't sponsored or anything by
TaskRabbit you can book someone to come
for like a certain price per hour just
to do random little tasks I could
theoretically hang curtains myself
except we have drywall and I have had
zero lucking frames on here let alone
curtain rods oh the curtain rod so this
was the curtain rod I ended up getting I
love the mirrored effect and this is
$12.99 and the curtains I think were
like $15 ish Rach got this Ottoman thing
which I really like and it's good
because she can just throw all of her
 in here next time I filmed in my
room and everything is gonna look
totally different which I'm excited for
I like to change things up I don't mind
small spaces like this it'll be nice to
have doors that's really what I'm
looking forward to I don't really care
about privacy I just some such a light
sleeper the past two days I've slept
like a baby in this bed I also
ended up getting this pillow which I
like it's just black and white I think I
am gonna paint
the walls in my filming room white
because I cannot stand tan walls this is
my backdrop from filming I'll probably
be taking this down and putting like
cute wall gallery things on this wall
and maybe like some kind of artwork
thing or something I don't know why I'm
showing you a blank wall but yeah that's
kind of what's happening in my world
right now this room does get really
freakin hot so that'll be interesting in
the summer my neighbor is back at it
yeah so this is what I get through my
room now that's fun so the curtain
hanging was an epic failure I attempted
to hang the ones on the window myself
and they're just super sheer and too
short so I'm gonna be returning those
basically just been working for the last
couple hours I'm debating whether or not
I should film today because we're having
people stay here at the next three
nights so probably won't wanna film I
guess I'll show you guys a super mini
paper source haul I don't know why I
don't go there every day of my life
because it is amazing I was watching
pretty shiny sparkly and I have been
obsessed with her vlogs lately she does
a lot of planning videos as well not
that I do on your planning videos
anymore I need to do planning videos but
my friend Denise from Etsy sent me tons
of adorable stickers so I'm going to
show you guys we're just chilling on the
floor right now
I'm just gonna show you guys what I got
from paper source and then an Etsy shop
paper source I don't know why the heck
I've never gone in there before they
have tons of cue washi tape and like
really unique stuff it is obviously more
expensive than like hogs a lot bigger
Michaels or whatever let's show ya the
first thing that I got I'm gonna frame
this and I just thought this was
adorable and the colors go perfectly
with our living room there we go that's
showing up a little bit better
this was 495 from paper source and they
had a bunch of other styles as well
they're the washi that I got is this
gold Moroccan print I think this is so
pretty this is probably the prettiest
washi own and there's a shit-ton in here
so that'll last me the rest of my life
and then I also got silver glitter washi
I realized I don't have silver I think I
have every other color glitter I feel
like I use the glitter of the most
so check out paper source if you want
some like unique really pretty washi and
the stickers I got are from its planning
time you can check out her
Instagram super unique adorable stickers
that I'm obsessed with clean brushes I
love this little like washing machine
thing it almost looks like the Instagram
logo some makeup stickers
I love these flag ones just tons of
different ones on her Etsy shop so I'll
link it down below look the first
stickers that I have for my Erin Condren
and I usually just use pens and washi I
actually attempted to film a planning
video a couple weeks ago and it was an
epic fails way too zoomed in and I
couldn't like zoom out with my lens and
have it focus whatever there's so much
behind-the-scenes stuff that you guys
don't see I know you think it's just
like a quick ten minute video but
honestly between editing and just
getting everything right for the actual
shot and filming and getting ready to
film it's a long process but I love it I
think this is my most dreaded task of
life
peeling off stickers ten minutes later
success I love how we've lived in this
house for eight months now and there's
still price tags on every single frame
alright so it is the next day I'm like
not even awake yet pass grab a guy is
coming right now to hang the curtain rod
and in vlog last night because they
basically just worked for the rest of my
watched revenge after he leaves I think
I'm gonna film I have my face on I just
have to do my eyes in the face I'm
wearing Revlon Colorstay mixed with
Estee Lauder Double Wear and this is
like my full coverage kind of face I
have a whole video on that exact routine
I believe and the bronzer I'm using is
the new Physicians Formula Paris bronzer
and I'm freaking obsessed with it I've
been wearing it every single day alright
so I'm a little pissed right now because
the guy just left charge me $100 to hang
a curtain rod I feel like to
hang two brackets that should take less
than twenty minutes and he was literally
here for an hour and charged me $100
so I complained at a scribe to support
so we'll see what happens but we didn't
even get the curtain rods up I'll show
you guys he didn't even get the curtain
rods up because it was the wrong size
but he put the brackets on the wall so
literally should drill two brackets it
took him an hour awesome so I'm going to
go back to Ross today to return the
curtains and the curtain rod and get a
different size we're headed to Ross
so Ross was pretty successful they let
me return all three things which is
really nice and I ended up getting like
a side table and a lamp which I wasn't
expecting but that's what happens when
you go into Ross and now I'm just
stopped on a bridge welcome to Seattle
there are draw bridges in there strange
so I'm going to go back and attempt to
assemble this curtain thing and film the
video before my roommate gets home from
work that's what we're doing to
Starbucks
hell yeah here's what I end up getting
at Ross there's got a longer curtain rod
thing and then this table which can't
really tell on camera but it's like
super tiny and I thought it would be
perfect for the side of my bed since
there's like no space and I'm gonna
spray-paint the black I think probably
silver yeah and I got this lamp which I
didn't even need but look at this thing
what this is so cute
is and gentlemen we finally have frickin
curtains I'm just gonna paint this the
great color that I paint in that
nightstand which I painted in a
different Leopard roadblock you can
watch that if you want to see how I
paint furniture I don't think you should
take that long because this is really
tiny think I'm gonna do a coat film and
then do a second coat alright so I did
my makeup and I am mid filming right now
and literally the only thing I can think
about is a burrito I realized I had that
croissant like hours ago now and I'm
freaking starving on my lips right now
is the smitten lip chin in love good so
far I'm all about these I just filmed my
intro to the room tour a shadow in
schmooze on the I look I'm wearing right
now so you guys will see everything that
I used and then my March raves and
rejects so I filmed three videos I don't
even know what time it is right now
we're gonna paint the final coat of that
piece of furniture then start editing I
just got an email back from TaskRabbit
support they responded within like five
hours I think basically the deal is that
on TaskRabbit you can't book anything
for less than an hour which is absurd
like what what if you just need
something hung on the shelf I just think
that's kind of crazy they you have to
get charged for at least an hour's worth
of work like what if you did that in 15
minutes that's kind of absurd so they
credited me $35 at a 15 dollar discount
thing so the final cost was $50 to hang
a frickin curtain rod I think the moral
of the story is I'm going to get my own
drill because if I have my own drill I
can do all this oh my
here's the table so far I have two coats
on right now and I'm about to do a third
so far so good painting furniture and
falsies like this accurately describes
my life he does in ginger ale got the
leopard robe on I'm gonna wrap up this
vlog I need to edit before the people
get here the people I hope you guys
liked this it was kind of all over the
place
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you like Leopard row blogs and you
want them to continue love you guys
thanks for watching and see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
