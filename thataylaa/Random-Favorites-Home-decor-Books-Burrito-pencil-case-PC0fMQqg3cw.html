I found it and I bought it he's came
with a set of 2 and I got two sets of
them so I four cups math there we go
alright so today we have non beauty
favorites I just filmed a halloween
tutorial so I have like half of the
makeup on right now my room is fully
covered in clothes and glitter right now
so we're on the couch got the caffeine
we're skin cozy today we're gonna chill
and just talk about some non beauty
favorites for not even the month what is
this piece of paper if you didn't know I
moved apartments a couple months ago
which is weird it still feels like it's
like a week ago I'm going to be having a
full apartment tour once I'm like
completely satisfied there's still stuff
that needs to get done holy this
way is so friggin hot so my first
favorite are these white marble posters
if you guys follow me on snapchat you
know that I have a way too intense
obsession with white marble right now I
don't know what it is it's just so
freakin appealing these are actually got
off of ebay and it came with a set of 4
for 16 99 which is a steal these could
be in like anthropology or urban
outfitters or something and they would
be like forty dollars they're real
marble but they're nice quality and I'm
super happy with them we usually keep a
couple on our living room table then I
also happen in my room i say i have this
rose gold candle which is from target
target is freaking killing it with the
home stuff right now i just love the
shape of this i don't know if you guys
can see that but it has like this
indentation right there and it just
looks so pretty sitting on a coffee
table or on a little side table in the
bathroom who knows it smells like
pumpkin and fall but not overly pumpkiny
I don't like super sweet intense pumpkin
smells I'm actually not a fan of pumpkin
that much like pumpkin pie doesn't do
anything for me but this isn't super
overpowering and it's just beautiful
when this burns through I'll just use
this to put like rings in or something
and just keep it on my dresser pumpkin
chestnut that is apparently what it is
if you haven't checked out the target
home section right now you need to go
okay back on the marble thing I swear
this is the last marble item when I was
decorating our apartment I heard the hmm
had really good home stuff holy crap
yeah I got a few different things for
our apartment from hmm but my
favorite were these marble they're
actually toothbrush holders for the
bathroom I ended up getting five of them
to store my makeup brushes in and then
actually holds a decent amount of
brushes looks really cute on top of my
vanity I didn't want to have like the
standard ikea white brush holders I do
like those but it's on something a
little bit different and these are
perfect I think they were like under
nine dollars i want to say love them
next is something that I am so freaking
excited about it literally makes my
heart happy he's just looking at it this
is my burrito pencil case you probably
saw the Instagram photo floating around
of a photo of this yes it actually
exists I googled it and I found it and I
bought it be completely honest I haven't
put anything in it it's just been
sitting in my purse because it makes me
really happy just looking through my
purse than seeing a burrito naturally I
think it's made for like tech
accessories or pencils you know you
could literally put whatever you want it
in here I kind of want to try and see if
makeup brushes fit in here because I
feel like you could use that traveling I
don't really know what I'm going to put
in it yet it's just been chillin in my
purse I'll link it down below a week
everything I can find down below okay
next I have these glasses and I don't
know if you guys can you do that they're
gold speckled a little like old dots and
they're just so freaking pretty these
are from paper source Paper Source
actually has some really great home
stuff and just like decor items they
have a lot more online than they do in
store at least the one by me these came
with a set of 2 and I got two sets of
them so I four cups math there we go if
you're making like cocktails or
something it looks really pretty in here
I could probably spend hours in Paper
Source next favorite are just flowers
from hobby lobby in general if you're
looking for good fake flowers Hobby
Lobby is where it's at this is actually
a bouquet that I made on my own I love
how you can like walk through and pick
the individual stem so it feels like
you're actually in a flower shop kind of
you can make your own arrangements
Lauer's that you guys see
sometimes in the background of my videos
are also from hobby lobby just fun to
like go through and pick out the exact
colors that you want and the different
little pieces wait until they have a
sales the flowers aren't on sale that
week it'll probably be the week after or
the following week so just wait because
you can save like forty percent and I
just have them in a little base thing I
don't even know where I got this oh this
is also from hobby lobby I got like a
couple years ago my next favorite are
these need sunglasses and I'm probably
going to get sunglass marks these
actually don't give me as horrible of
sunglass marks than other sunglasses I
have wow this is freaking great with the
ring light I can actually see what I'm
doing i posted a picture in these on
instagram and i got a lot of questions
so i thought i'd include him in here I
got these off of ebay they also have
them on Amazon I think these were like
seven or eight dollars free shipping
they are coming from like China Japan or
something so it took a while to come but
it was worth the wait they fit my face
perfectly i usually have an issue with
sunglasses being too wide for my face
they feel like really nice quality and
they're super lightweight my next
favorite is a book and i haven't had
time to read a book in probably two
years video 7 sports this week because i
was actually gone for over a week as in
boston chicago and ohio for work and so
i just got back and on the way back in
the airport i picked up girl boss by
Sophia Amoruso it wasn't really
expecting much from this I just wanted
something to like kill the time and an
easy read on the plane this book
actually completely surprised me she has
a really interesting story this is the
founder of nasty gal she basically just
tells the story of how nasty gal was
started she has a super unconventional
path she was a dumpster diver she was a
shoplifter so just a really interesting
story and if you need a motivational
read read this she has some really great
quotes in here my next favorite is this
sure egg holder this is a little slide
out k cup holder I got this out walmart
and it was one of those things where I
needed like 10 more dollars to get free
shipping so I ended up buying it and I'm
happy with it a lot of people store them
in those like stand alone things that
you put on your countertop we actually
have almost zero counter space in our
kitchen so what we ended up doing was
kind of making like a bar cart coffee
cart situation that you guys will see in
my home tour when it goes up you can
just sit your cure egg on top of this
little slide out thing so it doesn't
take up any additional space slide it
out in the morning pop in your cup and
you're good to go I believe it holds
either 24 or 36 which is a lot my last
favorite is super random but something
that I've found it super helpful and
that's this underwear organizer I also
got a bra one but i don't really like
the bra one as much this underwear
organizer i got off of ebay or amazon
door in my life it basically just
organizes your underwear and saves a ton
of space assigning am i under was taking
up literally half of my top drawer of my
dresser so I ordered this thing and you
basically just like roll up your
underwear I throw it in the little
divider triangle diamond things you can
actually see your underwear and then you
can also put stuff on top of it keep
everything organized and just mix your
underwear look really pretty who doesn't
like pretty underwear sounds all of mine
