popular demand we have my old camera
back in action YouTube problems so I
posted on Instagram a picture of this
bad boy and you guys wanted to see a
review I decided not to do a first
impressions video because I feel like
it's kind of boring watching someone put
a clear substance on their face so I've
been trying this out for about four or
five days give or take now so I can
actually give you a review on it rather
than you're just watching me put it on
my face also really quick I'm going to
be making my all about working at Mac
video very soon so comment down below
with any questions that you want
answered in that video and we can do
that today I have a Raver rejects video
on the new Garnier five-second blur it
is kind of a priming smoothing light
reflecting innovation in their words of
my bando is like at my bellybutton right
now so if you watch any YouTube videos
lately you have seen that the cosmetics
industry has been coming out with these
like crazy blurring pore minimizing
products I don't know what it is people
are loving it though we have the baby
skin which came out a little bit ago in
the US this is supposed to be a pore
eraser you have the L'Oreal miracle blur
so this is kind of Garnier's take on the
whole blur revolution so I got this for
$14.99 at Target which is kind of like
the mid price range for these kind of
products it says it is supposed to fill
in lines and wrinkles hide pores smooth
flaws mattifies shine I really like the
packaging of it I think it's really
clean I like the end for some reason I
really like the smell of it Garnier I
usually has really good smelling face
products when it comes out it comes out
kind of like a it's like a condensed
lotion if that makes sense it's
definitely not silicone based it feels
more of like a cream when you put it on
and then it vanishes into this really
nice super super smooth kind of
and it just disappears into your skin
and feels really nice doesn't leave a
residue or anything like that so it says
to use it after your moisturizer and as
kind of a primer for your makeup I do
really like it for that I really like it
for kind of under my eye area I do use
it all over my face but I'll Pat it
under my eyes I've been getting these
like crazy wrinkles under my eyes lately
don't know what's going on getting old
apparently this does help to smooth out
those lines and make my concealer go
over way easier as far as pore
minimizing I feel like it kind of works
the same as the baby skin in that aspect
I don't see a huge difference in my
pores being minimized but I do feel like
my makeup goes on way smoother the
5-second claim not sure it's 5 seconds
you do notice a difference like
instantly but I like to wait at least
like two minutes before I apply my
foundation over it I feel like when I
put it on and then come back a couple
minutes later and look in the mirror
then I actually noticed a difference in
the texture of my skin in the way it
looks I really don't have any complaints
this far with using this product it
might have broken me out but I'm also
trying a new product a new foundation so
it's hard to tell which one of the two
it is but yeah no complaints on this guy
I think that I actually really like it
I'm gonna go with the rave if you liked
this video and you like raver rejects
videos then click the thumbs up button
so I know comment down below if you guys
try this out if you want to see a
tutorial on how I did this the
Valentine's Day inspired look I'm
wearing right now then there's a link in
the downbar and we can have fun and
watch it together definitely forgot to
put on deodorant what we're good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
