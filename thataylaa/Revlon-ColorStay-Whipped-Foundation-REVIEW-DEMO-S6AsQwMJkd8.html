room about 25 times now so sorry about
the angle and whatever background but
we're just gonna have to deal with it so
today I have a review and demo on the
Revlon Colorstay whipped cream
foundation this is just now starting to
get talked about a lot on YouTube you
can get it from the drugstore I got it
at Rite Aid for like eight bucks because
it was 40% off Revlon but you can get it
at CVS or rite-aid whatever for like
13.9 I believe it's called a cream
makeup I don't really think of it as
whipped or cream it's more a like gel
consistency as you can see it doesn't
 move like it's stuffing there I
have it in the color 200 sand beige and
this is the second to lightest shade
okay so let's do the good things and
then the bad things I am probably the
world's pickiest foundation user I have
worn the same foundation for about a
year and a half and any foundation I've
tried in between then I absolutely hated
so it's a big deal if I actually like
new foundation with that said I
absolutely love this stuff I've been
reaching for this more than my
maybelline superstay foundation some
people were talking about this as like a
summer makeup I don't think this is a
summer makeup at all to me it's more
full coverage and more heavy I don't
think it feels like light on your skin
by any means but personally I like that
when you put it on you feel it it
doesn't feel like whipped like it says
things that I like it is extremely full
coverage I guess it could be medium I
mean just depending on how much you put
on your face usually I apply my under
eye concealer first and then my
foundation this stuff covers up almost
all of my under eye area and blemishes
so you get to use less concealer and I
also find that if I put on my concealer
after this stuff my concealer it doesn't
crease as much and it just like goes on
but it it says it's 24 hours um I don't
know why you would need your May
to stay on 24 hours unless you're a
stripper or some but it stays on
for as long as I need it to keep in mind
that I do use and make up finishing
spray before and after my makeup so that
helps the lasting power I don't have too
many negative things about this
foundation the only thing I would say is
their color selection is horrible for
people with warm skin tones like myself
it is very hard to find a foundation
that doesn't make me look yellow when I
wear a self-tanner like I have on right
now you can't tell but if I were to just
wear this like Oh tan or nothing it
probably would be too yellow the other
criticism I have of this is it looks
huge like this is a huge ash jar but
look how much glass there is your
product really only goes halfway down
the container and it goes pretty fast
like I am halfway done and I have used
this probably for a week and a half now
every day you'll see how I apply the
foundation and everything like that in
the demo to use a sigma f80 flat top
kabuki for this foundation and I just
dip it straight into the jar I don't
know how sanitary that is but uh yeah so
I just apply it all over my face to
start with my cheeks and then forehead
and do my nose last um and prior to this
I did apply moisturizer primer setting
spray everything like that so you can
see how completely full coverage this
foundation is I did show you the rest of
my foundation routine use some concealer
Maybelline mineral power powder
foundation and then set it with Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray
that was my demo slash review on the
Revlon whipped cream foundation if you
liked this video and thought it was
helpful click the thumbs up button and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
