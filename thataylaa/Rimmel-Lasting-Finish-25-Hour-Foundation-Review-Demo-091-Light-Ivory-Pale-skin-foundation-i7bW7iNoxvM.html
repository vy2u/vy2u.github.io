this is round two filming this video is
my first video I'm attempting to film on
the kid in t5 I long story short before
this turns into a whole rant squeaking
this is not how it's going to look I'll
be more zoomed out I was having issues
with autofocus making noise and you
couldn't even hear my voice so it really
did two hours of google searching to try
and fix my problems so I don't know what
I'm doing wrong with this new camera
anyways I hope this works for the time
being
11:20 at night we're doing it so this is
going to be a quick review on the new
Rimmel lasting finished 25 our comforts
here in foundation ah who knows what
comfort serum actually means I don't
know why you would need your foundation
to last 25 hours I feel like nothing
good could ever come from the 25th hour
you're awake this has SPF 20 and I'm in
the shade 91 light ivory supposed to be
a full coverage foundation that's
basically sweat proof transfer proof
everything proof so I'm just going to
give my quick thoughts on this and then
we'll show you the demo so I've actually
been testing this foundation out for a
couple weeks now if you saw my Instagram
post like I don't know and that was like
two months ago guys want to see a review
on this foundation and so here we are
two months later I have some serious
cystic acne going on which you'll see in
the demo videos definitely lives up to
the full coverage claim I feel like some
foundations say that and they're totally
not full coverage or some youtubers
think they're full coverage not me I'm
like this is like a BB cream yo this one
is definitely full coverage I mean my
face looks pretty freakin flawless right
now I love the finish of this foundation
I'm not wearing any powder or anything
on my face right now and I've been all
about like the natural do if you not I
mean like not super glowy but just where
it looks like skin and the thing with
this foundation is that I feel like most
foundations after about 15 minutes
that's when they warm up to your face
and begin to look like skin this one
literally as soon as you put it on your
face it it looks like your skin just
like Follis the consistency of the
reminds me almost exactly of the Dior
skin foundation it's almost like a
gel-like consistency this I like way
better than your skin it's like a ticket
the smell and consistency and everything
I feel like is pretty freaking similar
to the Dior skin shade wise I think this
is perfect for me in this lighting and
like when I was just in the grocery
store I was checking myself out you know
how they like mirrors above the
vegetables but he always thought was
really strange like what are those
they're to see what my face looked like
and it looked like perfect the perfect
shade it wasn't too late it wasn't too
dark and that's like really rare for me
since I'm so pale they do have seven
shades in the line which isn't a lot but
it is a drugstore foundation so I feel
like that's kind of typical 710 shades I
think I got this for around $8 so it
probably retails for between eight and
ten pending on where you buy it why my
head of breath right now
when you first apply it it feels pretty
tacky and it does take a while to set
it's like completely not transfer proof
at all which is awesome if you have a
boyfriend or girlfriend that's always
the worse when you like hugging someone
and your makeup gets on her shirt won't
happen with this stuff this is one of
the few foundations that I feel like I
don't have to powder and it doesn't make
me early throughout the day and it still
stays on my face literally all day long
I'll put this on at 6:00 in the morning
when I get ready for work I usually keep
my makeup on to like 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.
when I'm like finally motivated enough
to wash my face so it stays on a good
what is that like 16 hours yeah to me
the only downside with this foundation
is the scent it is very fragranced I
actually like the scent of it but I just
am NOT a fan of fragrance products
because it's usually not that great for
sensitive acne prone skin I really don't
have any other downside to this should
you buy this I think that you should
totally try it out and keep your seat if
you don't like it return it it's like a
lot of people don't do that at the
drugstore but you totally can and you
should if you don't like something so
the demo was shot four hours before with
shitty ISO you can definitely hear the
autofocus and
nothing I can do about it now afterwards
so apologies for that are with me will I
figure out all this camera stuff how
nice would it be if there was just like
a tech person that was available 24/7
for youtubers that person would make up
 on money
okay so clearly my skin is pretty shitty
right now I'm trying out another pill
and I'm going through the purge phase
right now but it is just well it is just
awful right now so brush I like to use
to apply this is the morphe I think this
is like the kabuki foundation brush this
is really old I don't even know if they
make the same style but the f80 by Sigma
will work or any kabuki brush I just
love this one for full coverage
foundation right now it just distributes
the product really well I'm just going
to put a little bit this on the back of
a palette for PAL I just use an old Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works candle then and I feel like
when I do that I waste so much less
foundation and putting it on the back of
my hand so let's just start I just start
on my worst parts of my face and this is
a super super fragrant foundation it
smells like smells good but I don't know
it always just feels kind of wrong so
here is my side with Foundation and here
is my side without lovely as you see
this does a pretty freakin great job of
covering everything the way that it goes
on it feels almost like a gel let's do
the other side while we talk the way it
goes on feels almost like a gel which is
how I kind of described the do our skin
foundation okay so as you can see pretty
much all the acne is covered up as good
as it's going to get I'm going to go in
on my forehead the thing with this
foundation is that it does take a pretty
long time to set completely so I usually
put it on first obviously and then do my
eye makeup so I have for us my makeup on
and I just want to give you a close-up
of what the foundation looks like it
still definitely feels sticky but
nothing comes off when I touch my face
alright so that was my review slash demo
