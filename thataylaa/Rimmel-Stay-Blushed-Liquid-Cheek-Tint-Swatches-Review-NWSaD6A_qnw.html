put on a smoky eye and we're going so
today I have a video on the brand new
Rimmel stay blushed liquid cheek tints
cream blushes I have not been able to
find these in stores in the u.s. yet
they've been out in the UK for a few
months I believe so I had to order these
online went on a fricking manhunt to
find these ended up being able to find
four out of the five shades online off
of ASOS and eBay and Amazon I just
checked online and you can find these at
Walmart now for 297 which is like a
third of the price that I got them for
Walmart is only carrying them in certain
stores so if you can find your location
online and they have it by you then I'm
jealous
so basically Rimmel came out with these
cream blushes that are part of the stay
matte line kind of thing I'm guessing
look at how cute the packaging is I just
think they're so adorable in like mini
comes in this really tiny bottle you get
0.47 fluid ounces but they're super
pigmented so you don't need a lot of
product at all when you're working with
it so I'm going to be showing you
swatches and things on the other half of
the screen throughout this video as I
talk about them so 0:01 is probably my
favorite this is pop of pink it's a
super pretty like flushed pink color my
favorite way to apply these is using a
small stippling brush because these are
super pigmented and a little bit goes a
long way I really think a stippling
brush would be the best way to go
I know elf makes a really cheap version
of this but it just blends it in
flawlessly and gives you like a kind of
like airbrushed cheek I'm super
impressed with the blend ability of
these if you are a cream blush person I
would totally recommend trying to get
your hands on these for me I don't think
I would use these on a daily basis just
because I do like to use a liquid
foundation and a powder and when you're
putting a cream with the powder it gets
kind of tricky but I've been applying
these is just on top of my liquid
foundation and then putting a
translucent powder over everything but
for someone who doesn't wear a lot of
face makeup or going into summer just
wants like a quick color on their cheeks
this would definitely be perfect for you
you could throw on like a tinted
moisture
they're a BB cream and then this guy and
you're good to go for summer I do think
that you'll be starting to see a lot
more of these coming up in the
drugstores and things so if you can't
get your hands on them online don't
worry I have faith they'll be in the
drugstore
so that was my super quick review of the
Rimmel stay blush liquid cheek tints if
you like this video and you want to try
them out be sure to give the video a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching and see you next video bye
just black on black on black right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
