video are we talking about rocksbox
today which is basically a jewelry
subscription box look at this packaging
I am super excited about this because
jewelry is something for me that I
rarely have a piece of jewelry that I
will wear for like ever
I like to switch out my necklaces and I
feel like I get bored of the statement
necklaces really quick so this is like
perfect for me rocksbox is basically
like a Netflix for jewelry you get three
pieces in the mail for $19 a month you
can return them whenever you want and
they're valued at over $200 so like
these aren't really fricking nice pieces
of jewelry which is like kind of scary
because then I'm like crap what if I
lose one of these so I'm gonna show you
guys what I got try them on and just
we're gonna talk about Ross box so like
I said it's 19 dollars a month and you
get three pieces of jewelry you
basically go in rocks box take a super
quick style survey that's like fun
because you get to click pictures and
 and their stylist choose three
pieces of jewelry to send you whenever
you're ready to return them once you're
done wearing them you can either send
all three back and they'll send you
three new ones or you can choose one of
the jewelry pieces to keep if you want
to buy it and they give you 20% off I
probably wouldn't do that just because I
don't really invest that much money and
like high-end jewelry but if there was a
piece that I really liked or I wanted to
get it as a present for someone then you
get it 20% off I think their packaging
is adorable I really appreciated the
card on the inside everyone gets a
personalized card and obviously looked a
lot prettier when I first opened it but
I'm just like obsessed with this
packaging on the inside of the card it
tells you what your pieces are and how
much they retail for over like a $350
value basically in this box and my
stylist was Amanda what's up Amanda
personally I think they did a really
awesome job picking necklaces that I am
too let's try them on so the first one
is this piece right here this is like
freaking heavy feels like super high
quality I wear this to work with just
like a black tie neck what are those
called just like a black crew neck
t-shirt and it looked
really cool take care problems so this
is what the first piece looks like again
it's like super heavy and feels really
nice I just really like the way that it
sits and everything I think it's like a
good length what is this one doing so
this first one is called Cece psyche
Benatar statement necklace this is
normally $220 if you buy it after this
it's 175 I wouldn't buy this but it's
awesome to be able to wear a $200
necklace like never in my life would I
be able to do that so when you send it
back you can tell them whether you love
it like it or it's not your style and
you can leave them comments I'm
definitely gonna do that because then it
helps them better choose your next
pieces the second piece is House of
Harlow 1965 station necklace and
perforated black that's quite the name
normal price is $75 if you buy it from
them you can get it for 60 I didn't wear
this one just because I have an
identical necklace I feel like everyone
had these like a year ago
I literally just filmed a video that had
a lawnmower outside the whole time and
now my neighbor decides to vacuum right
above me this is the second necklace I
really like how it has the like leather
looking black this is the only necklace
I got that I have doesn't wear you can
also choose between necklace rings and
bracelets bracelets never fit me because
I'm super small wrist in rings I just
like statement rings I don't really wear
I just wear my same two rings every day
so I got this mainly for necklaces I'm
all about a good statement necklace so
this one I really like I wish this
wasn't so expensive because I'm really
tempted to buy this one so this is the
third piece I just think this is so
pretty and like it's edgy but still kind
of like elegant looking you know what I
mean Gordana Bali three charm necklace
this retails for $118 if you buy you can
get it for 94 this
are you me I've worn this
probably like 10 times this month I just
really like this and I feel like you can
wear it with anything this is like
spot-on my style Amanda you did a good
job with this one like I said this is
normally $19 which I think that's
amazing for getting to wear like $200
necklaces or pieces of jewelry every
month I do have a coupon code for you
guys if you want to get it for $9 for
your first month like why the heck not
right you cancel anytime there's no
obligations or anything like that you
get free shipping both ways which I
really like they print out a shipping
label for you I'll leave the link and
everything you guys need to know down
below if you want to check out rocksbox
and ease back now this end is coming up
if you guys liked this video be sure to
give it a thumbs up so I know like you
guys thanks for watching see ya my next
video where there will hopefully not be
a lawnmower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
