new naked 3 palette from Urban Decay
finally got it comment down below if you
want to hold the review on this here's
me being excited in slow motion yeah
let's do this so we're gonna prime our
eyes using the Maybelline inked in pink
color tattoo and I like to use these out
of the face and since we're doing kind
of a pink rose bold look this is the
perfect color and I'm just applying this
all over the lid up to the brow bone
then using the it's Judy's time palette
I'm using that middle of soft brown
shade and this is gonna be our
transition color using a fluffy brush
with kind of a pointed tip I'm doing
circular motions and then kind of like
windshield wiper and you'll see there we
go and it's just gonna be a transition
color and help all the other colors
blend
seeing this light pink shade I'm going
to put this on like inner third of my
eye and then we're gonna go in with
trick which is that really pretty rose
gold color but it has a shit-ton to fall
out so I'm using the elf makeup lock and
seal drops and I just mixed that in on
my brush with the shadow and that helps
it to apply without going everywhere and
it gives it more of like a metallic
pigmented look then I'm going in with
nooner which is a really nice matte dark
warm taupe shade and we're going to
blend this into the crease to help
deepen everything up a little bit and
I'm going in with black part I believe
is called which is the darkest shade in
the palette it does have a little bit of
sparkle to it which I thought was
interesting for being the only dark
shade palette but we're just putting
this in the outer V and I'm dragging it
inwards a little bit to help everything
blend and make it more smoky here I'm
just using a sigma e40 brush without any
product on it
this is just a really big blending brush
and this is going to help everything fun
then we're going back in with the trick
and again I'm using the elf makeup lock
and seal and I just wanted to make it
pop a little more and as you can see
this definitely helps it's so much more
pigmented now and I think this
helps to tie the whole look together so
then going back with that first shade
we're rubbing this along the bottom lash
line the inner third to help brighten up
the eyes and then for the brow bone I'm
using that first matte shade and we're
just popping this under there using a
nooner again I'm using that same flat
shader brush and just smudging this
along the lower lash line I wanted this
look to be really smoky and it's just
going to help everything like fade in
one another and you'll see in a second
we are going to use black part again
on a flat liner brush and we're going to
put this on the outer third of the eye
as a liner then I use the Maybelline gel
liner in black and I'm just going to
make it's like winged liner with this
this is obviously best warded I'm not
that quick
you can use any black liner that you
want for this I just like the wing I
think it makes it more like romantic and
flirty looking personally
and I'm going to add some black liner on
the waterline and mascara on the top and
bottom lashes and this is what our eyes
look like now that we're done
yay now we're going to move on to lips
and I'm taking this lipstick by L'Oreal
169 and it's like a light pink color
it's really moisturizing that's why I
like it not one of those like gross news
that makes your lips look old rocky then
I'm going to go in with this new L'Oreal
eyeliner Ashley but we're using it on
our lips because I felt like it it's a
really pretty shimmery pink color and
I'm just lining the lips with this and
it just adds a little bit of sparkle I
don't know I felt like putting liner on
my lips now we're done thumbs up this
