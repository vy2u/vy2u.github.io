doing a look featuring this shadow as
soon as I got this in the mail I wanted
to put it all over my face I actually
did a full snapchat tutorial on my face
makeup that I'm wearing right now so I
didn't do that in this video I think I
want to do that more often on snapchat
so it's the tail of snaps if you want to
get in on that I'm just gonna quickly
tell you guys what's on my face then
we'll jump into the eyes and everything
else so I tried out the Misha intensive
covered cushion foundation have a full
review on the other Misha cushion
foundation blush is my holy grail wet
and wild in the purple haze concealer is
Too Faced Born This Way concealer which
I actually have a little bit different
of an opinion than a lot of people seem
to actually think this is nothing like
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I'm
not really a fan of this product I think
it's lighter coverage super dewy creases
really easily on me and I think there's
a difference between being dewy and
being moisturizing this concealer just
really doesn't work for me I'm going to
talk more about this in my next rays and
rejects video you can guess which
category that we'll be in and then the
highlight I'm wearing is actually an eye
shadow I'm in this weird eye shadow as
highlighters phase right now this is the
Catrice glam fusion powder two gel eye
shadow this is brand new from Catrice
it's like two bucks on Ulta and this is
in the shade John snows favorite I'm
addicted to finding new eyeshadows that
can be used as highlighters and this one
is really beautiful it's not glittery at
all it just gives your face a really
nice sheen definitely not as intense as
s and snowflake highlight but if you're
looking for something that looks kind of
like Mac's mineralize skinfinish in
lightscapade i think this one actually
gives a really similar effect so I think
that's a and then I set my face with a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination and that is everything
that's on my face if you want to see how
I did the eyes lips all that good stuff
you're in the right place just keep
watching so my face is already done
because I just did a full snap tutorial
which I probably talked about in intro
so we're gonna skip that I'm trying out
the Catrice prime and find a brightening
eyeshadow base and anything that says
brightening I like to go for because if
you have pale skin sometimes it's hard
to find a light enough a shadow base
need to try the next one I don't know
why I've never tried the next I used to
use the NYX jumbo eye pencil and milk
all the time to prime my eyes the
consistency of this feels a lot like the
Urban
que primer potion which who remembers
when that was like this on YouTube
like five years ago feel like I haven't
heard anyone talk about that in years
now I feel like this is one of those
primers that when you blend it it kind
of blends off your concealer that you
have on your eyes but I'm putting bright
eyeshadows overtop today so I won't have
an issue with that but if you're gonna
be doing like a new book or something I
do feel like this kind of takes away
some of your eye coverage found one of
my old pallets that he used to always
use and had a couple morphe single
shadows that were literally like a
little cave in them I used to use them
so much and I believe those are so old
that they reformulate them and renamed
them since then so I want to dig back
into the morphe single shadows and see
if I like them have a pallet here filled
with mostly singles they're all singles
filled with mostly morphe so I'm gonna
start out by taking the shades silk
which is a matte kind of cream shade I'm
just gonna pack this on the lid just to
set that primer I don't always set my
primer just depends on the one I'm using
but it does help to make it super easy
to blend shadows on top of it because
instead of blending on a cream you're
blending on a powder then we take a
slightly smaller blending brush this is
the e22 and then go in with flawless I
feel like I forgot to do something
it's my mic on let me know what you guys
think of this new mic in my time it's
still new this video will probably be
going up actually when I'm in Mexico I
have a ton of pre recording to do
this weekend because this week is gonna
be crazy with work stuff I feel like
this is when those shadows that you have
to build up if you really want color oh
Sh I clipped out the hair people are
weird with hair
some people like freaked the out if
you don't clip back here this is for
those people now I'm gonna go in with
this super tiny blending brush which is
one of my favorite brushes from the old
elite collection and the new elite 2
collection brushes I talked a lot about
in the last shadow in today's video so
I'm not gonna go into it here there are
certain ones I think are worth it other
ones aren't but the eye brushes are
pretty similar and they're super soft
still I have no issues with the eye
brushes at all it's mostly the face
brushes that are a little bit different
to me but the eye brushes are super nice
this is the e17 I'm going with makeup
geek Coco bear which is this like
reddish brown shade
and just defining the crease a little
bit with this I'm putting this mostly
like right where I want my crease to sit
and it's okay if you're messy with this
since we're gonna be using a super
bright color it's gonna cover up a lot
of this so I'm just gonna put it
wherever I want on my lid and just make
sure it's super blended I do want a
little bit of a halo eye today so I'm
bringing this pretty far in and just
sweeping across that middle area but
mostly focusing it on the inner and
outer areas and up into that crease over
the years I feel like I shadow is really
all about learning your eye shape and
just playing around before I hop in the
shower at night half the time I still
play with eyeshadows and just try out
different things on my eyes you're gonna
wash it off two seconds later so it's
okay if it looks like but you do
really have to practice I'm by no means
perfect eyeshadows sometimes it looks
like sometimes it looks great you
never really know but you're never gonna
get better at anything in life if you
don't practice I think this is black it
looks a little bit like a purplish black
to me but we're gonna roll with it this
is the shade royalty by morphe es 88 and
I'm gonna go with the e 18 even tinier
blending brush and I'm literally just
gonna be putting this right in the outer
area right here black can look really
muddy really quickly so you want to make
sure that you're just placing it exactly
where you want it and then I go in with
an empty brush and blend it out so
whatever is left over on that brush I'm
just super lightly blending up into the
crease we want barely any product on
there else it's gonna look really muddy
I'm gonna go back in with the e 22
there's no product on here and so I'm
just gonna blend a little bit alright
star the show color pop to shy this is
from the rainbow collection and I feel
like I got to sneeze woo
this brush is the Coastal Scents be
rs.20 I like to use this to apply shadow
to my lids if I'm not using my finger
half the time I feel like colour-pop
shadows apply better with the brush half
the time feel like they apply better
with the finger for the initial
application because I want to place this
in like a pretty specific spot I'm gonna
use a brush I'll probably use my finger
to get a little bit more pigmentation
but let's just take a moment to
appreciate this shadow
because this is insane I think these
might be limited edition so I hope that
when I upload this video they're still
available knowing my life they'll have
just gone out of stock like the day
before or something I'm bringing this
right where my kind of eyeball meets the
crease not blending it too far
inwards or too far out mostly keeping it
kind of on the center I want it to fade
into that black and we're probably gonna
have to put more black on look at that
blue Thank You color pop for existing I
still remember when I first heard about
color pop when they were like super
small a few years ago and it's just so
cool to see how much certain brands have
grown over the years
so I'm actually kind of feeling the way
that this fades into the black it almost
looks like a darker blue since it's not
like super black so I think I'm actually
just gonna leave it I don't think I'm
gonna add any more dark shadows to the
top oh yeah look at how much more insane
color you get with your finger no idea
what I want to do for the lower lashline
I don't think I want to apply top
eyeliner today I think I just want to go
in with lashes because I have these
super separated wispy Ardell 600 blacks
and those kind of lashes usually look
really cool without eyeliner on I do
think I want to smoke out the lower lash
line though I'm going with some black
waterline eyeliner first this is by
julep what aren't you focusing I'm right
here bro there you go hey trip liner a
place so nicely to the waterline I want
a super black black shadow to blend that
out with so I'm going in with makeup
geek corrupt on this liner brush first
just gonna stamp oh I'm getting a lot of
fallout
it's gonna look really intense but don't
worry we're gonna blend it out I'm gonna
go back in with the shade flawless okay
we're gonna have to fix that fallout
situation okay got the fallout situation
under control I actually do think I want
liquid eyeliner on the top make a peak
erupt is no joke you guys so just to
kind of balance that out I do think we
need some eyeliner I am kind of
connecting this to where that black
shadow is there we go
small wing I basically just want to
connect those two I'm gonna apply a
super thin coat of mascara then we're
gonna go in with falsies not sure if I
want to use those Ardell anymore I like
the look got a little more dramatic than
I was anticipating ooh
okay I'm feeling these yep we're still
gonna use these guys they're super wispy
super pretty
okay lash glue is still drying so you'll
probably see it but I am in love with
these I feel like lashes always look
different on one eye probably like the
angle that you go in with them I don't
know anyway so let's go in with bottom
lash mascara Wet n Wild mega length for
my favorite I'm just gonna put a little
bit of mascara on the bottom Oh totally
just forgot to put on an inner corner
shade so we're gonna do that I've
attempted to go in with like a yellow
and just go all out first I'm gonna put
on lips and then I'm gonna go in with an
inner corner shade just to see how it
looks
since eyes are super intense we're gonna
do a nude lip going in with colour-pop
BFF liner I'm only lining the outside
because I want it to be a pretty pale
nude so I'm gonna go with 860 smooth
taupe from Maybelline I feel like the
yellow might be too much right now I
think I'm just gonna go in with makeup
geek voltage super pretty
almost yellowish white looks amazing on
the inner corner I mentioned that in
Ray's and rejects this is the e 19 brush
I love using this brush for inner corner
Hakkasan color really well alright folks
