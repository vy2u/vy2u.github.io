save money on your one of those shopping
online non-believers by the end of this
video you're going to be out shopping
online Queen people have all these
excuses for why they don't shop online
shipping you can't try things on all
this stuff but those are false people I
have somewhat of a shopping online
addiction so I've gotten pretty good at
it over the years when saving money
online there is one website that I go to
before any other website website is
called Ebates
and basically it's one of those websites
where you sign up it's free and they
give you cash back for every purchase
you make online with the qualifying
websites obviously and also when you
make your first twenty five dollar
purchase you get a free ten dollar gift
card in the mail there's like Target
Barnes and Noble Ebates cash I got a
target one came in the mail it worked
everything was good so basically say I'm
going to be shopping online Sephora go
to Ebates the links down below sign up
super easy takes two seconds all you do
is in the search box type in Sephora com
it'll come up it'll tell you what
percent cashback it is it's always
changing some days they do like specials
where it's like eight percent cashback
some days it's four percent cashback
some websites have more than others it's
just whatever it is when you want to buy
from it so say Sephora is eight percent
cashback you click on Sephora all you do
is click the shop now' button and that
will direct you to Sephora and Ebates
now has that information so when you
make your Sephora purchase through that
link
after you click shop now your account is
going to be credited the correct amount
of cash back it usually takes about we
can have to show up also on that page
when you see the shop now' button
there are usually coupon codes free
shipping codes everything like that
so ii bates is
my go-to website you have to go through
Ebates to get the cash back you can't
just go straight to support calm and
hope that Ebates magically sees it so if
you want to sign up for eBay's the link
will be down below that's my number one
tip number two
eBay is your best friend forget
about Sally or Joann or Emily no no its
eBay oh stem Joe whatever probably going
to keep it in people's complaint about
eBay is that they either don't know how
to use it or they don't have a PayPal
account well let me tell you
it's about time you make one a it takes
about one minute to sign up for eBay to
PayPal you can not only use on eBay but
you can use PayPal on various other
websites so you don't have to whip out
your credit card and go through that
hassle you just use PayPal you can find
pretty much anything on eBay I wouldn't
suggest buy makeup on eBay because there
are a lot of knockoffs and fake products
and things like that but literally
anything
I will first check eBay and then Amazon
simple things like car chargers cell
phone cases just check before you buy
anything taking the time to look on eBay
and being patient enough to wait for it
in the mail pays off because you save a
ton of money Amazon it's going to be
like an honorable mention because
honestly I'm not that crazy about Amazon
you can usually buy find better deals on
eBay but things like textbooks school
books things like that that's what I buy
on Amazon other ways to save money
online blog sales if you are into makeup
which you probably are if you're
watching this um
blog sales are a great way to get
high-end makeup for cheap pretty much
any of the high-end makeup I haves are
from blog sales if you don't know what
blog sales are you are missing out on
life basically when people sell their
good for cheap online on their blog
if you have like sanitation issues and
obviously blog sales aren't going to be
for you but some of this stuff is new
but a lot of it is like slightly used
that doesn't bother me say it's a blush
I just wipe it with a Kleenex when I get
home that doesn't bother me I will leave
the link down below to a website I
found that basically has a list of all
the blog sales up to date they update it
every day and so I went through a phase
where I would like literally check them
every day and like order new makeup
because it's so damn cheap like how can
you not sorry if I just fueled a new
addiction for some of you hot look if
you watch any YouTube videos you know
what hot look is are out look whatever
the hell is called but basically it's
like a flash sale website where every
day they have new brands and sales and
stuff like that where the stuff is
extremely marked down I usually only buy
makeup up there but they have like shoes
clothing jewelry everything and you can
get some really good ass deals so if
you're not signing up for hot look I
definitely would you can get there like
email notifications where and I think
they have an app now where you get
notified like what's on sale that day
but there's been Knicks the bomb Brown
brush a lot of stuff everything I don't
want to go through like every single
website has cheap stuff but basically
check the down bar because I'm going to
be like putting them in categories I
have a few really good cheap jewelry
websites clothing websites things like
that so if you're into shopping online
or you want to get into shopping online
then you can go check those out after
eBay and Ebates
third most important thing that you need
to check every time just like Ebates
before you check out online go to
retailmenot.com you type in the website
and tons of coupon codes will come up I
know there's other websites like this
but RetailMeNot is the easiest to use to
me and I just really like it I always
find good deals there you tell me not
just a really great tool for coupon
codes free shipping tons of discounts
things like that you can find really
good cheap online so that is all my
shopping online quick tips if you like
this and it was helpful click the thumbs
up button I'm going to say this in every
video but this is a pre-recorded video
if you're confused click the link down
below I where I am video and it'll
explain everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
