talking all about Seattle love Seattle
one of my most asked questions from you
guys is I'm visiting Seattle what should
I do
where should I stay what should I eat
and I'm gonna answer all those questions
in this video so I'm not originally from
Seattle but I've lived here for about
three and a half years now so I think
that someone qualifies me to have a
locals perspective local tips for you
guys so I wanted to just make one video
talking all about Seattle my top
recommendations things to get you out of
downtown that's like my number one tip
most people when they come to Seattle
they stay downtown they see the Space
Needle they go to Pike Place Market
classics and well downtown is great and
there are definitely some things that I
think are worth seeing they're the best
places the best views the best
restaurants everything in my opinion is
not in downtown so there's a bunch of
surrounding neighborhoods and think
they're considered towns within the City
of Seattle so there's Ballard Fremont
Capitol Hill Green Lake Queen Anne lower
Queen Anne Magnolia there's tons those
are the area's most people live most
people chill most people go to coffee
shops II walk around so we're gonna talk
about everything what I would recommend
if you're coming here and then you can
kind of narrow it down based on what you
think you might want to see the most I
love Seattle so much that if anyone is
visiting Seattle I want you to have like
a true picture of what Seattle really is
because I know the first time I came to
Seattle I didn't even know anything
existed outside of downtown and like I
thought that was Seattle I really want
you guys to have the best experience
possible if you come to visit Seattle
and hopefully you fall in love with it
like I did it's when I was in Europe a
few weeks ago I actually wrote out all
shit-ton of notes there's like a novel
here of things that I want to mention to
you guys in this video so I really
thought this out it's kind of like
categorized to get ready to take some
notes in case anything sticks out to you
I'm gonna try and have mostly these
things linked down below or written down
below so you can refer to the
description box too so if you're excited
for this video and you enjoy while
you're watching and you find it helpful
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up I really appreciate it if you're new
here you can join the bay Rito family

Wednesday Friday 6:00
Pacific time I typically do makeup
videos but I also do some travel content
vlogs and here we are Seattle Seattle
videos - apparently Seattle is a huge
transplant city for those of you who
don't know Amazon is based here
Microsoft is based here Starbucks Zulily
Seattle's a huge tech city tons of
people from San Francisco Silicon Valley
are moving to Seattle have moved to
Seattle especially in the last two years
so it is a huge booming tech city
there's tons of jobs in Seattle people
are moving here from all over the
country for me I feel like that's kind
of a cool part of Seattle it's chill and
it's still pnw I can't believe I just
said pnw I usually just type that on
Instagram it's still part of the Pacific
Northwest and it has that chill vibe
then there's also this other vibe of
startups and tech and just people going
at it doing their thing weather let's
quickly talk about weather actually
wasn't even gonna plan on touching on
this but I feel like I need to because
people think arraigns like 24/7 in
Seattle I have lived in other parts of
the Pacific Northwest that were so much
worse here we get Sun it does rain quite
a bit but it just depends on the year I
would say July August September I think
are usually are like sunniest months and
it can get pretty hot fall I think is
the best time to come like October when
the leaves start changing and it's not
quite the rainy season yet this year we
had such a pretty fall it was sunny
almost every day it was warmer than
usual and the leaves were changing and
it was just perfect to come in the
winter it's not bad you just will
probably have rain they'll probably be
pretty gloomy if you bring an umbrella
you'll definitely be a tourist so first
thing we're gonna talk about if you're
coming to Seattle you need to figure out
a place to stay so if you want to stay
in a hotel most of the hotels are
downtown in Seattle there's some really
nice hotels they can get pretty pricey
you can use Hotel tonight which I've
used in other cities where you can
actually get like half off on a lot of
hotels if you booked it that day or if
you booked it a couple days in advance
if you want a hotel recommendation for
something that is pretty affordable
mid-range for Seattle prices and hotels
it's just pretty easy to access
different areas from I would say go with
the Hyatt house so not the normal high
up but it's called Hyatt House
it's literally like right below the
Space Needle so if you request a
on that side you'll probably have a
killer friggin view of the Space Needle
my parents have stayed there before it's
a really nice hotel in a good area if
you're going to Seattle first splurge
like an anniversary or a honeymoon or
something I would say stay at the
Edgewater it is right on the water
I couldn't tell by the name it's a
beautiful hotel they have a really nice
restaurant right on the water but if I
were to travel to Seattle I would
definitely stay in an Airbnb there are
some awesome Airbnb zin great locations
I would say stay in capitol hill if you
want that more City lively nightlife
kind of feel that's where most of the
bars and stuff are it's very close to
downtown it like connects to it Ballard
and Freemont are a little more funky
tons of good restaurants and coffee
shops in those places good farmers
markets tons of little cute boutiques
and shops and that kind of thing so that
would be my advice as far as where to
stay so now on to how to get around do
not rent a car in Seattle because
parking is a nightmare traffic is also a
nightmare in Seattle best way to get
around in my opinion is taking uber pool
uber pool is essentially like carpooling
with uber but you pay a lot cheaper than
you would just for uber just budget that
into your travel expenses or whatever
because it's gonna be a lot cheaper than
renting a car you won't have to pay for
parking you don't have to park it's
quick it's easy seattle public
transportation you can also take bus we
also have light rail thing but seattle
public transportation is pretty bad
we're working on it i think or if you
can walk or bike another thing that i
started using in the summer is the bike
shares so there's a few different ones
lime bike oh pho camera but the other
ones are called right now i use o pho
just what i have always used you just
download the app you unlock it and open
i'm pretty sure is free I've never
actually paid for an oppo I don't know
how they make money
guessing they have some kind of permit
or something with the city and if you
just want to like explore some of the
areas I'm going to talk about to using
something like o fo is a really good
option because it's pretty much free if
not free and it's just fun
all right so moving on to views / things
I just think you have to see if you
visit Seattle obviously the number one
thing that Seattle is kind of known for
I feel like is the Space Needle
well the Space Needle is really cool to
see and I think it's something that you
obviously have to at least walk up to
even if you don't go up but what I would
recommend is skipping paying to go up
the Space Needle and instead go to
Columbia Tower Columbia tower is in
downtown Seattle and it is a huge
building huge skyscraper it's actually
taller than the Space Needle the view is
insane you just go all the way up to the
top the observatory level and you do
have to pay but I believe it's less than
the Space Needle and it has a 360 view
of Seattle so you can actually see like
Lake Washington Mercer Island Bellevue
you can see other areas and I feel like
that's a really good way to kind of get
your bearings you can kind of see how
everything connects that's something I
would definitely recommend doing on your
first day in Seattle one of my favorite
views if not my favorite view is from
Kerry Park in Upper Queen and Kerry Park
is only like a ten-minute uber ride I
would say from downtown like if you're
due in Pike place you could easily Ober
or walk up to Kerry Park if you want to
work out it's a huge-ass Hill going up
to Upper Queen Anne I believe it's where
Sleepless in Seattle was filmed I'm not
a movie person so I've never even
actually seen that movie I should
probably do that but it has a killer
view Cary Park there's always tourists
there if you want to be at the tourist
go early if you don't care about that
and you want the best view possible go
at sunset it is insane I'm crossing my
fingers for you that you get to go to
Kerry Park on a clear day because the
most insane view is when you can see
Mount Rainier the huge mountain
hopefully you can plan it to go to Kerry
Park when there's like a nice clear day
the next spot is Golden Gardens it's
actually not a garden I definitely
thought it was a garden before I went
there it's a beach right on the water
there is some hikes that you can do
around there it is beautiful to go to in
the summer if you're visiting in the
summer I definitely go to Golden Gardens
I even think in the winter or the fall
if you're visiting it's still such a
beautiful spot that I think is worth
going to and there's a cute little like
hot chocolate kind of place right by
there so if you just want to go when
it's cold and get like a hot chocolate
and then walk along the water we do have
beaches in Seattle there's also one in
West Seattle
Alki des Works Park
probably my second favorite view after
Kerry Park a huge grassy hill right on
the water on Lake Union you're coming in
the warmer months you could bring like a
picnic and chill out there there's a
poke a place that I would highly
recommend if you're into poke a it's
called 45th stop and shop it's like a
total hole-in-the-wall place in the back
of this convenience store it always has
a line wrapping around the block that's
how amazing it is getting get that there
and then walk down to gasworks Park and
eat it at the park so Pike Place I
obviously have to quickly mention that's
the famous market that everyone knows
you see the fish flying you can get
really cheap flowers there pretty much
the only reason why I ever go there now
is just to get flowers if I need them
for something you are already around
there alibi room is really fun for
drinks the gum wall is right by there
while you are downtown the ferris wheel
on the Seattle pier why think is worth
it it has a really good view especially
if you're doing it again at sunset or at
night too if you're into museums that
you're Huli glass museum is probably my
favorite in Seattle also Discovery Park
it's not really Park it's huge it's
basically an area where you can bike
hike there's a lighthouse right on the
water
I usually go there and do like a couple
mile walk to the lighthouse again you
could also bring like kind of a picnic
lunch there and sit on the sand by the
lighthouse you're trying to like take
some photos or something it's a good
photo spot right there it's super pretty
if you're here in the summer and you
have an extra day I would say take the
ferry to Bainbridge Island the view from
the ferry when you're going away is like
the famous shot that they always show on
Grey's Anatomy
it's really weird living here now after
watching that show for so long
Bainbridge is just a really cute tiny
little quaint place there's some good
breweries there there's some wine
tasting you can bike around it's just a
good little like day trip away from
Seattle
those are my must-see views so I have a
lot of information here on bars and
brunch and food I'm going to talk about
that next because I feel like that kind
of like coincides with the areas because
usually when you walk around an area you
go into little shops and you eat so
let's start with brunch Seattle is a big
happy hour in brunch City so in the
summer for brunch or for any meal I
would recommend westward it is right on
the water in a different areas not
downtown if you want a good rooftop for
brunch tarapada is great the food is
okay when I say as far as brunch food is
like
best food but the atmosphere is really
nice it's also right across the street
from the new Starbucks roastery which I
actually think is worth seeing even if
you're not a big coffee person or
something it's just pretty cool since
Starbucks was born here it's right
across from Pike Place the first
original Starbucks store and like I said
the Starbucks headquarters is here so
they have this roastery that was the
first one I'm not sure if there's any in
other cities now but a couple years ago
they opened it in Seattle pastilles and
Ballard is one of my favorite brunch
places they have a huge outdoor patio
that even if you go in the winter they
have big fire pits and heat lamps and
stuff outside and I think it's also like
closed off so you can go at any time of
the year really good food really good
atmosphere if you go during the Sunday
market is Ballard on Saturday or Sunday
they have a farmers market kind of thing
so it's fun to walk around the farmers
market and then go to bastille's Lola is
like one of the places that you'll find
probably if you're looking on Yelp
keep in mind Seattle is not a foodie
city
I wouldn't say Portland is much more of
a foodie place don't get me wrong we
have some great restaurants great food
places there just a little bit harder to
find anything that's recommended on Yelp
has been horrible so I honestly would
not follow Yelp I would ask for local
recommendations biscuit bitch in Portage
Bay are like two classics so those are
my brunch recommendations if you're in
Seattle let me know if any other places
down below always on the lookout for a
good brunch the fat hen is actually
really good too let's move on to just
food in general so like I said Seattle
is a huge happy hour city you can get a
lot of really amazing deals and happy
hour food clubs and bars and stuff close
at 2:00 a.m. in Seattle super early so
you kind of have to start your night
earlier which is why I think a lot of
people do happy hour and then you kind
of just go to a bar and then start your
night there since it does end so much
earlier than a lot of other cities so
probably my favorite restaurant in
Seattle happy hour no happy hour is list
in Belltown go there for happy hour if
you can because you can literally get
like under $10
nokey steak salads really good food for
literally under $10 it has a really cute
moody kind of like date atmosphere but
you can definitely go there with like
groups of friends and stuff it's a fun
place black bottle which is also in
Belltown has a really good vegetarian
food even if you're not vegetarian I'm
not and they have really really really
good veggie
dishes one of the best meals I've ever
had in Seattle for dinner is Rock Creek
amazing food is on the nicer end but
it's not like super super pricey it is a
nicer dinner so you you know Seattle we
don't really ever dress up like people
go to nice restaurants in like North
Faces here so you really don't have to
worry about that local 360 is pretty
good the food is a little bit different
the atmosphere is really fun that's a
good brunch place too but also for
dinner and this right on the street
where there's a lot of little bars and
stuff too in Belltown the best burger in
my opinion is 8-ounce which is in
ballard they might have a couple other
locations but 8-ounce burger in ballard
is so good so good good milkshakes great
burgers I actually get their veggie
burger there because it is amazing
Ballard you could definitely go to
Golden Gardens for the sunset eat dinner
at 8 ounce and then walk around that
area if you're going to Seattle for a
celebration of some kind you want a
fancier nice nice dinner
candless I think is considered like the
nicest I haven't been there yet gotta
wait for the parents to come back in
town for that one it's really fancy
apparently has a good view my personal
favorite is Ray's boathouse it's like a
nice steak house kind of place you have
to be a little bit dressy for that one
but it's right on the water
really close at Golden Gardens actually
I've had great food every time I've been
there so you just ate you're feeling
good let's move on to bars and things to
do at night a night out on the town so
one of my favorite bars which I guess
you go to for dinner and I think they
have happy hour and stuff too a zig zag
Cafe it is downtown but it's in this
really cool kind of like in the middle
of a stair thing going down really cool
atmosphere if you don't want like a
rowdy bar and you just want somewhere to
get a drink and maybe get a dessert or
something zigzag is really fun so there
are a bunch of speakeasies in Seattle
and one of my favorites is called
bathtub gin &amp;amp; Co it's by Pike Place part
of the fun of going to a speakeasy is
figuring out how to find it and get in
so I'm not gonna tell you it's a really
fun atmosphere if you want to go to
speakeasy Edel and thread is another one
there's a bunch of them you can just
google Seattle speakeasies when I first
moved to Seattle I was like all into the
Capitol Hill scene going out go into the
one club they're going to some of the
bars there
and I'm just not really into that
anymore it's not really my scene but if
you want that Capitol Hill is a place to
go now if I go to Capitol Hill I really
like the garage you're into pool or
bowling that's a fun bar that has those
two things one of my favorite places in
Capitol Hill is Capitol cider really fun
cider place go downstairs that's where
the fun like bar area is - rooftop Bars
em bar is really popular it's in South
Lake Union which is where Amazon is
based so a lot of like Amazon people go
up there for happy hour and stuff
definitely go for happy hour because the
prices are pretty up there I personally
like for all like it's downtown on top
of a hotel and they have like the really
pretty string lights and fire pits and
stuff and it's just a good spot to get a
dessert or drink sometimes they do like
little concerts and stuff up there
ballard in fremont are a good place to
go for just like get a beer and chill
it's not like the same kind of scene as
capital hill in the summer fremont
brewing is awesome they have tons of
like picnic tables and stuff outside so
you can sit outside if you're trying to
go clubbing like I said Seattle's not
really a big clubbing city but if you
want to dance a place that I would
recommend in Capitol Hill it's Rhyno
room if you like rap they usually play
good music also Ballroom in Fremont is
really fun I do feel like the crowd is a
little bit younger but you never really
know it kind of just depends on the
night I'm losing my voice I'm talking so
much right now so looking at my notes I
think that was everything I wanted to
touch on so I hope that was helpful for
you guys and I hope your trip to Seattle
is amazing and you fall in love with it
as much as I have Seattle is just a
really good combo of having city water
outdoorsy stuff you can drive to the
snow it just has everything and I feel
like when you step outside of downtown
hopefully you can really see that with
some of these recommendations and if you
do go to any of these places I would
love to see tag me on social media I'm
gonna put my handles in right here you
want to see what any of these places
look like definitely follow me on
instagram because i post tons of seattle
photos so if you enjoyed this don't
forget to give it a thumbs up I love you
guys thanks for watching see you in my
next video bye
