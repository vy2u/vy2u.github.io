Community Foundation I triple-checked
what day it is because I have no idea
how it's day 11 I feel like this is kind
of cutting off my circulation right now
so days 1 through 10 are linked down
below in a playlist you guys will only
have a few more days of hearing this
feel so today we're going to be talking
about this for a 10 hour wear perfection
foundation I was going to do this in the
last 15 be it's a foundation series and
then it just didn't make the cut so
let's go on to score and read some of
the claims about this thing so its
foundation retails for $20 and you get
zero point eight four ounces of product
so a little bit less than a standard
foundation which is one fluid ounce this
comes in 37 shades which is amazing it
looks like it goes pretty deep the
lightest shade is 0-5 light porcelain
I did not pick that one up because it
said for pink undertones kids and I end
up going with is 10 light ivory neutral
there's also an 8 light ivory but it
says pink undertones and on the picture
it actually looks darker than 10 so I'm
gonna sort swatches of the shade 10
compared to some the other foundations
that I own
alright so swatch time right here is the
Sephora foundation in the shade 10 next
over is l'oreal infallible Pro matte in
the shade 101 and here is it again in
102 watching like 4 videos worth in the
same day right now so that's why I
included this one bencomb custom
foundation shade derma call to 0-8 pur
cosmetics bear doll in porcelain tart
reinforcement C in porcelain and Urban
Decay Naked Skin Foundation in 0.5 on
the back of here it says it's medium
coverage it does say it's buildable and
instantly conceals blemishes with an
invisible flawless finish supposed to
conceal pigmentation marks scars and
dark spots and provides a natural
beautiful finish below optimum comfort
all day long and it has soft focused
pigments that help blur out blemishes
and soften the appearance of wrinkles
for a youthful looking even complexion
so it's lasts up to 10 hours the product
is not tested on animals
that's all the claims on this thing
you're enjoying 15 days of foundation
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up only four days left so if you want to
see what I think of the Sephora 10 hour
where perfection foundation you're in
the right place just keep watching okay
let's do this so right now it is 813 I
woke up at 6 a.m. don't ask me what I
just did for 2 hours I've no idea
I've already washed moisturize in prime
my face using the Laura Mercier
foundation primer and we're going to
test out half of my face with a damp
sponge and the other half with
foundation brush this is a morphe 31 -
pretty much my only brush is clean right
now I should probably do that tonight
well it's a glass bottle for some reason
didn't feel like that when the plastic
was over it the pump on this looks
exactly like the Milani 2 &amp;amp; 1 foundation
pump which I do have a video on I always
get asked about that one I have a video
on that if you ever want to know if I've
done a certain foundation you just
search the Tayla plus the name of the
foundation in youtube and since it's
listed in the description box any videos
that I have will come up actually pumped
out exactly like that - it's pretty sick
it's not really moving around at all
someone started out with a brush on this
side of my face I'm gonna start out with
this I know how the coverage is going to
be oops
taking the mic out it's not really
covering my acne I just put a lot down
here to see if it would cover it and it
like 50% covered it my stomach is
growling doesn't have a scent at all
yeah it's looking pretty luminous off of
that one layer with a brush is looking
like medium coverage it does say it's
supposed to be buildable so I am going
to try and build it up with a little bit
on a second layer so let's go ahead on
this side and try it out with a sponge I
wanted to address a couple FA cubes
while we're applying this thing so the
reason why I don't do half my face with
powder and half without oh I'm getting
better coverage with the sponge is
because for me my powder never matches
my face I don't use translucent powders
because they take away any of the
coverage of my foundation for whatever
reason on my skin so if I did half my
face with powder half my face would
literally be a different color which is
fine if I don't have to leave my house
but you know I got to live my life and
things I think it's pretty split on
whether you like to see it with the
powder every single time or just go with
the flow and see what I'm feeling for
that foundation and the reason why I do
some foundations with powders and some
without is that sometimes I can just
tell on my skin when the powder is not
necessary or when it's just going to
cake up the foundation
the Foundation's already feeling pretty
heavy sworn the mat side I typically
don't use a powder and that's because
when I apply my foundation on daily
basis there are definitely certain
foundations that I do not use a powder
and it looks better on my skin without a
powder so if it works for you applying a
powder with every foundation you put on
that's great
knowing my skin it can cake up really
easily if I do that I just kind of feel
it out depending on whatever foundation
I'm using if it needs a powder or not so
let's see if this is buildable I
actually like how it applied better with
this sponge I think I got a tiny tiny
bit better coverage on the side the
shade might be a little more yellow than
my chest but I think it's actually
matching pretty well so see if this is
buildable with a sponge another
frequently asked Opik is building the
foundation doing a second layer versus
spot concealing the purpose of doing a
second layer is mostly to see if it is
buildable for me in the last few months
I've actually preferred just going in
with a spot concealer before I put on my
foundation then I usually only have to
do one layer foundation so if you do
have acne you might want to consider
trying that something I got a whole lot
more coverage on that it's still looking
like medium coverage I'm going to get up
close you can see so as you can see my
scarring and ask me is still totally
coming through down here and on my neck
far as coverage definitely more on the
medium kind of natural side but I like
the finish of it super pretty skin
finish looks pretty good on my forehead
it feels very lightweight too it doesn't
feel like I have a lot of foundation on
right now I think I am going to powder
my face with this one because it is in
the luminous side and also it just kind
of has that feel to it's not totally set
down and feel like it might move around
so right now it is 824 in the morning
I really do you guys probably can't even
see the time can you I'm going to do the
rest of makeup and I'll be right back
okay so it's now a 9 o'clock so that's
when where you're calling the second
time I can't really breathe right now
good times so I did end up setting my
face with a powder I used my a cosmetic
celebration foundation illumination
I also spot conceal just on the acne
down here because I have to take some
photos right now for Instagram I really
liked how it looks with this powder on
top it looks very smooth dewy finished
right now and it looks pretty good I
want to say it looks like my favorite
thing I've ever put on my face right now
but it looks good my pores look a tiny
bit emphasised right now but the center
of my forehead looks good my cheeks
looks nice and smooth so on the rest of
my face for contour I use the freedom
Pro contour kit I kind of rediscovered
this too past few days and
obsessed with this all over again this
is a shade medium zero two there's also
a medium zero one but this shade right
here is perfect if you like that kind of
reddish bronze for blush I use the Tarte
Amazonian clay doll face blush this used
to be one of my go-to blushes back in
the day with that out again highlight is
my favorite Jade cat you glow girl
highlight in Bella Rose beautiful so
pretty
just one super neutral in the eye is all
of my eye shadows are from the a BH
palette then I'm wearing the cocoa
risque lashes I had to majorly cut these
like the actual length of the lashes
because they were literally above my
eyebrows white eyeliner on my waterline
and then lips I'm in love with this
color this is a smashbox legendary
liquid metal in the shade petal food
that rhymes this is the most comfortable
metallic liquid lipstick formula i've
tried so far it's not matte has more of
a blast formula but it's not overly
sticky very moisturizing feeling and
just comfortable on the lips so let's
set the alarms what time do I just say 9
o'clock so I'll check back in with you
guys in a few hours in natural lighting
producers eyelashes coming off this at
2:45 my phone is literally at 1 percent
so it's charging right now foundations
been on for a little over 6 hours it has
definitely oxidized it's not even
showing up quite as orange in this
lighting lets you guys back up yeah it
kind of it's oxidized at least a shade
not that there's a good kind of oxidize
but this is definitely very bad kind of
oxidized especially on my forehead it's
just like a gross tone of orange it's
really not showing up on camera but
overall I feel like it looks good on my
cheek area which is typical and then in
all of my kind of problem areas like my
forehead and around my nose and upper
lip it just doesn't look the best right
now even one of you guys on snapchat was
like girl your foundation to that and I
was like I know I feel yeah I just take
a moment to acknowledge that I actually
kept my lashes on for a check-in for
once in my life but my t-shirt is
different and we got leopard robe on for
some reason I feel like it's showing up
better on camera right now it's just
clinging on weird in some parts like
right here around my nose and my upper
lip it's already starting to crease and
kind of kick up a little bit as you can
see where I rub back my bangs it has
totally rubbed off the foundation right
there but here's what the center of my
forehead looks like just don't think it
looks that good see how this continues
to wear throughout the day right now I'm
not
love in it I'm going to keep working you
to eat lunch and I will talk to you guys
in CRS okay so it's now at 8:30 p.m. so
foundations been on for almost 12 hours
so this is a long check-in but I looked
in the mirror at the 10 hour point and
it looks pretty much the same as it does
now which is pretty bad so I'm going to
do the eyes in my forehead is completely
separated right now so pretty much all
of this is separation up here and then
around my nose I'm extremely oiling and
just cakey not loving how this held up
at all so I think for me this one is a
pass for sending with a powder it just
did not hold up well at all on my skin
I'm not super wowed by how first one on
either and also oxidized a shade or two
so not like in this one I feel like
we've had more rejects than good
foundations in this series so hopefully
tomorrow will be a good one so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
make sure to give it a thumbs up love
you guys thanks for watching see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
