every time I go to filmer intro they
start yammering great timing alright so
today it is day two of fifteen days of
foundation if you're new here this is
where we're trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days if you
missed yesterday's video you'll want to
go watch it because I shared a lot of
information about the series and just
stuff to get us all on the same page I
forgot to mention in day one that the
products I'm showing in 15 days
foundation versus foundation Friday
these are like the most requested
foundations from you guys ones that I've
been holding on to for this series or
that are just brand new and have gotten
a lot of hype around them so the
foundations in the series are like the
ones you've been waiting for so today
we're going to be talking about the
Sephora perfection mist airbrush
foundation this has been one of the most
requested foundations for a couple years
now I think because I mentioned those in
do review on it a couple years ago like
when I first got this shade put it on
one time and it was way too light and
the color looks super off so I like took
it off that was the only time I've ever
used this product I have no incoming
thoughts on it besides that this shade
was too light so I actually picked up a
second shade this first shade that I
tried was cream and this one is very
very pink toned and also just super
super light so if you are even more fair
than I am this one might work for you I
picked up the shade fair this time round
which is the shade up that has more
neutral undertones I feel like my face
looks best when I have a neutral
undertone foundation I think I can go
pink and I can go a little bit yellow
but neutral is I feel what works best
for me so I'm going to search some
swatches right now of these two shades
compared to some of my other foundations
that I own so these are kind of hard to
swatch I'm just going to spray them and
show you so this is the shade cream that
lightest shade I'm just going to do it
like right here here we have the next
shade up fair
I think I could go with this lightest
one it just like washes me out a little
bit so this is a little tricky but
hopefully you can see so next one over
ice watch the Sonia Kashuk foundation in
bisque from yesterday this is Estee
Lauder Double Wear in 1 c1 and then
here's Lancome tonight ultra and zero
nine zero this lighter shade of the
airbrush foundation is actually looking
a little bit more neutral than the zero
nine zero and Lancome so if you haven't
heard a whole lot about this foundation
before some people call this a dupe for
the D or air flash foundation I haven't
tried that one I just I don't know at
$60 for spray foundation just seems
absurd to me but I'll probably cave and
review it at some point but this one is
half the price this is a full-on
airbrush foundation so you basically
like sprayed on your face I'm going to
show you how to do it so it's read some
of the claims on Sephora you actually
get a ton of product in here you get 2.5
fluid ounces of product and this retails
for $28 senses in an aerosol that might
be why you probably have to use a lot
more product than just a liquid
foundation so as far as how long it's
going to last you compared to something
like this where it's just a liquid
foundation it has about a fluid ounce of
product hard to say because it obviously
depends on how much product you use so
it comes in 10 shades the fair range is
pretty good since I do have this super
pale shade I'm not sure about the deeper
shades but it says there is a deep shade
dark with red undertones 10 shades not
great so it says it blurs imperfections
seamlessly and control shine for up to
10 hours with a satin finish foundation
the wait list Micra find pigments of
insta blend technology ensure color lays
down smooth and seamless you can build
to your desired coverage level from
light to full so your supposed to be
able to get it up to full coverage will
see something like this in my mind seems
like more of a special events kind of
makeup since I don't think you would sit
there and like spray on your face
every day so I'm hoping that this wears
well throughout the day and lasts long
because of that if you guys are excited
about 15 days foundation don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up so if you
want to see how this foundation applies
and where it's throughout the day you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right it is 8:40 in the morning so
are you watching prime my face with the
jouer anti blemish matte primer I have
my Sigma f80 brush here we're going to
try it with this too but I want to first
go in and see
how much coverage we get by just
spraying it on my face directions say to
shake well for five seconds we've
already done that cover hair and clothes
wasn't ready for that close eyes and
hold can ten inches away while pressing
on nozzle moving in circular motions
let's to blend it out with the brush for
lighter coverage spray directly onto
brush and blend in for fuller coverage
spray sixty inches away from face
spraying and circular movements so we're
going to do six to eight inches so I'm
trying to get some coverage over here I
just got this shirt that I'm just going
to wrap around mix I don't want to get
this shirt messed up and I guess we'll
pin back my bangs filling it more in a
bib this is scary
so everything it feels a lot different
than spraying setting spray like I don't
know where my face is oh yeah okay going
to go in just gonna go in
whoo oh I feel like I can't breathe
whoa okay well there's definitely
product on my face
well my earring is like totally covered
did get it all in my hairline the shade
looks a little dark I felt like it had a
really strong scent it smells super
chemical and I didn't want to like
breathe in and inhale it so you kind of
have to like hold your breath when you
put it on I'm going to try and go in
with a little bit more maybe just on
this side of my face if we can get any
more coverage I'm gonna do six inches
now which I feel like is right here
maybe so we've got a little bit more
coverage I think I missed like down here
you can definitely see that this isn't
totally blended so I'm just gonna go
back and blend with this thing
well okay that's like taking away I'm
going to try and spray this directly
onto the brush and see what happens so
that gave me pretty much no more
coverage you can still see everything
down here think you do get better
coverage but just spring it on but then
when you blend it out it kind of just
takes it all away so I might try
spraying it on again and then blending
it out with a sponge I want to try and
get right here so I can see how much it
covers
put my freaking turtleneck on well okay
that did not blend at all okay not bad I
would say that got about we're at medium
coverage now on this side yeah that
covered actually pretty well down here I
do the same thing on this side I feel
like I missed this spot down here so I'm
going to really layer it on
okay now we're talking with the amount
that I just put on which I feel like was
a lot now I know why they give you 2.5
fluid ounces with this amount I feel
like we got about high medium coverage
it looks pretty full coverage on my
forehead because there's not a lot of to
cover up there but you can still see
some freckles and stuff coming through
it's not completely completely full
coverage but do you feel like we got
solid medium coverage this shade is
definitely a little bit dark and it's
pretty yellow actually if it is hard to
blend down your neck without getting
foundation everywhere so I'm just going
to go in and spray some of that on my
brush just to blend it a little bit
applying it to the brush does virtually
nothing think to get product you really
have to just spray down here it looks
like it's hardening the set and feels
like it is it's looking a little bit
more matte on my forehead it still looks
really dewy so I just turned down the
lights here is what it looks like up
close right now so I'm going to give it
a few more minutes to set and then apply
the rest of my makeup alright so it is
911 oh I hate looking at the clock at
911 did super simple makeup today
because I'm actually having to go to the
chiropractor right after this I'm going
to be face down so the foundation might
get messed up a little bit but that's
not until 11:30 I tried my best to plan
all of my doctor's appointments and
chiropractor and massage and all that
around when I'm filming and stuff but
sometimes I just can't would it I found
out some pretty intense health news
yesterday I'm just having to make a lot
of lifestyle changes but just so you
know if I'm not super chipper or
whatever I usually am don't think it's
chipper that is why the food restraints
are like the least of my concerns
honestly that's just what we're doing to
try and help the other stuff anyways
let's look at the foundation so now that
the rest of my makeup is on I actually
really like the way that this is looking
I feel like the shade of it not warmed
up to my skin but I don't know once I
put the concealer on under my eyes I
feel like it just kind of brightened up
my face a little bit decided not to use
a setting powder tape because it
actually set pretty well I don't want
the powder to take away from the finish
that we have right now blush bronzer
highlight blend it out okay on top it
kind of took away some of the coverage
that I had on my cheeks which happens to
me some
times with certain foundations it's
still looking really nice and like dewey
on my forehead the rest of my face looks
like a satin finish the only area that I
think doesn't look great right now is
around my pores and I didn't pull down
my concealer today I kept it I only did
three tiny dots and I just put it right
underneath my eyes so hopefully you can
see this but right here my pores look
pretty huge and it looks a little bit
like heavy around this area I don't know
why I noticed that before I even started
doing the rest eye makeup it just looked
a little bit heavier around this area
the forehead looks really nice as of
right now I'm liking the finish of it I
like how it looks on my skin it looks
pretty flawless I'm not a fan of how you
have to use this to get this kind of
coverage there's no way in hell I would
spray this on my face every day and like
wear a bib essentially personally I
would only use this like once in a blue
moon for special events if I wanted my
face to look like super flawless and
airbrush and stuff because I feel like
this is more of a special events
foundation I am going to do a flash test
just to see so I'd say it looks pretty
good in flash there might be a little
bit of flash back but my face doesn't
look like extra ghostly white let me see
what it looks like on the normal camera
okay this looks really good on camera
what the heck so super quick I'm gonna
tell you guys what's on the rest of my
face if you want to know so I use this
new it cosmetics genetic walk in a sick
wa don't know is it just our new face
palette and this I was like hell yeah
when I open this because it has this
white face powder I use this underneath
my eyes to set my concealer bronzer I
use this shade right here I didn't use
blush at all today and I feel like this
gave off a really nice like warm ready
bronze without being too orange and then
this highlight it cosmetics highlighters
always surprise me they look horrible
when you swatch them even on your hand
or using a brush I even tried to like
use a brush and put it on my wrist and
it looked really bad and I almost didn't
put it on my face and then when you use
a brush it that's something magical on
your face
there's the highlight really like this
highlight same thing happened to the my
sculpt to face palette the highlighters
just like surprised you like I do almost
every day on my eyes all I did was use
that same bronzer and put it into my
crease I put a little bit of the high
my lid ask where I used the L'Oreal
voluminous to bridgetower mascara and
then my lips are color pop fairy floss
floss that's it so we're calling the
check-in time 910 the nice check and I
do will be 9 10 11 I might do a checking
in a couple hours in natural lighting
will see where I might wait until I get
back so I will see you guys in a few
hours all right so it's now 210 so the
finish we almost had exactly 5 hours I
went to my appointment you can see a
line here where my head was face down
but it actually held up pretty well I
mean it definitely is like rubbed off
down here a little bit but usually it
looked like a hot mess when I come out
of there so I feel like considering it
has held up pretty well if for sure has
mattified quite a bit when I was in my
car the car lighting looked pretty dark
but I feel like cars always do that for
some reason I'm going to get really up
close just so you can see the texture
and finish and stuff nose looks pretty
Creasy yeah it's like totally worn off
around here which didn't really touch
anything so I'm just gonna put a little
bit on the brush to touch up those
bottom areas just where it wore off you
really have to like coat it move on the
brush to get anything anything to show
up I'm just gonna do a tiny bit where it
wore off in the center of my face it
looks like it's layering fine okay so
got a little bit more coverage
my brother's kind of messed up now well
it's okay so this is what it looks like
after the touch-up like I said it is
about two o'clock I will be back to
check in at the end of the night whoo
all right Kay so it is 6 o'clock so
foundations but on for about 9 hours I'm
having a rough rough day I think I just
need a little bit of time to process
everything that I learned yesterday I'm
trying to stay optimistic sorry that the
first two days of 15 days of foundation
have kind of been a show between
migraines and crying and emotions
what is this anyone's new here this
isn't how first impressions usually go
so the foundation is definitely not cry
proof not waterproof yeah all all this
is off but if we just look at the rest
of my face let's do that it looks really
good still I'm not setting it with a
powder it looks really great on my
forehead it looks really nice and
smooth looks like a soft matte finish to
me like once I actually sets it
definitely doesn't look as luminous as
when you first put it on it just said
there's oil controlling properties in
there so that's probably why I haven't
gotten oily let's just talk about the
practicality of this for a second
because I just don't see myself using
this someone needs to invent something
that you can just put on your head like
one of those dog cone things that's what
we need that would be great then you
could just go to town and spray I like
how it feels super lightweight I like
the coverage that we got but I feel like
I had to use a ton if you're looking for
a foundation for like special events and
photography and stuff and you thought
this was going to be it I think the
Julie stick foundation that I reviewed a
couple weeks ago in foundation Friday I
think that one is amazing for special
events and it's easy to apply and
doesn't get you covered in foundation as
far as different skin types dry skin you
probably need to moisturize really well
underneath this mature skin it didn't
settle in any of my lines and stuff so I
think for mature skin this one could be
okay oily skin it held up pretty well I
think this could be worn across
different skin types just depending on
how you prep your skin not totally in
love with it but also don't hate it you
don't think it's a bad product by any
means I just don't think it's for me and
I wouldn't use it enough to justify
twenty eight dollars for this guy
tomorrow we're gonna have a good day if
you guys like this video and are excited
for the rest of 15 days of foundation
make sure you give this a thumbs up I
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
