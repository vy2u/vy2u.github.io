my leg all right so today it is day two
of 15 days of foundation this is where I
test out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days I'm gonna leave day one
link down below also the kind of
announcement video where I talk more
about the series if you're new here
today we're talking about a new
foundation this is a stick foundation by
Sephora there make no mistake foundation
and concealer stick a lot of you guys
wanted to see this one tested out
there's a special place in my heart for
a good stick foundation
I love stick foundations the make up
forevers stick foundation is one of my
favorites so I'm on Sephora to read some
of the claims this product retails for
$20 and you get 0.41 ounces of product
to give you some comparison other stick
foundations Make Up For Ever has 0.44
and the Jolie cream stick foundation
which I have a review on has 0.35 it's
sad that I have those memorized is that
right yep this seems to be kind of right
in the middle as far as the amount of
products you actually get in here this
comes in 16 shades I have the lightest
shade zero one drift away they all named
after wood they're all named after wood
wow that's different I'm learning so
many new woods koa never heard that one
I'm gonna serve swatches right here of
this foundation compared to some of the
other foundations I own the lightest
shades so swatch time right here is the
Sephora make no mistake stick foundation
in the lightest shade driftwood next
over is the makeup forever stick
foundation in 115 Julia stick foundation
in soft cream derma call to 0-8 is my
closest shade match and Urban Decay
Naked Skin Foundation and 0.5 very brief
description on this thing it says it's a
medium to full coverage foundation and
concealer stick with a natural matte
finish two and one multi tasker can be
used both as a foundation and a
concealer the creamy formula does not
settle into fine lines and wrinkles
that's all it says so that's good for
all skin types if you're excited for day
2 of 15 days of foundation
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up while you're watching if you're
enjoying you want to see what I think of
the Sephora
make no mistake foundation and concealer
and how to apply somewhere throughout
the day you're in the right place just
keep watching okay day 2 so already wash
moisturized and primed with my usual
which will be linked down below since
this is a stick foundation I typically
like to use either a stick foundation is
kind of my go-to brushes are the Sigma
f80 2 round kabuki this one is very
dense good for stick foundations I
washed all my brushes last night pat on
the back or I like using this elf brush
this one doesn't have a name on it but
it'll be linked down below just for the
sake of trying it out I might try it out
with a sponge on the other side but
usually are the best luck with stick
foundations with those brushes tensions
are definitely out to party over here
it's all good hopefully this isn't too
late I forgot that this for airbrush
foundation their lightest shade is very
very light I'm just gonna apply oh it's
gonna be too light I'm going to apply
how would a usual stick foundation I do
about 4 stripes like that let's start
out with the Sigma f80 2 brush blend ok
so you can see when I'm blending you can
still see the stripes it's not totally
easily blending and I'm putting a lot of
pressure on this right now to blend it
out doesn't like glide over like the
makeup forever stick foundation okay I
applied a very decent amount of product
it says it's supposed to be medium to
full coverage off of that I would call
this low medium coverage you can see
everything something is in the sable see
if it covers yeah you got my neck it
definitely has like a drag - it's not
easy to blend out at all that doesn't
really cover this supposed to be a
foundation and a concealer in one so
after I do the other side I will go back
in and try and cover up some of the acne
as like a spot concealer this is just
like not blending I'm like using all of
my force to blend this out right now
woah it's making my forehead look very
dry the center of my forehead well I
think you guys can even see that on the
viewfinder it looks like the frickin
Sahara does
right there also looks pretty dry right
here in this area okay let's try the
other side so I'll try this sponge on
this one if it didn't blend out with
that brush I can not see this blending
out with a sponge but let's try
you can't even like pounce this because
you really have to like tug at your skin
basically to blend this out there is no
glide to this product whatsoever
actually think it blended it out about
the same both sides look like I don't
even think I would call this medium
coverage honestly looks like light
coverage just looks like it toned down
the redness basically I'm gonna try the
elf brush on the other side of my
forehead just like disappears what is
happening sponge I actually think it
blends out the best with the sponge
probably because I adds a little bit of
moisture back into your skin does this
thing is so dry but I mean it still
looks like with a sponge I'm gonna
go back in on top of my acne since this
is supposed to be like a concealer - and
just kind of dab it on areas where I
need more coverage I need more coverage
everywhere right now but I'll try and
just dab when I go back in with this
brush actually just do the sponge since
that's working better it just looks very
very dry for me kind of the whole point
of a stick foundation is that it's quick
it's easy typically they have good
coverage and I can just kind of put it
on when I'm rushing this there's no way
you could use for that purpose since it
takes so long to work with by the way I
forgot to say the time when I started
10:09 right now so it probably started
around 10 o'clock I didn't get like any
coverage on my forehead so I'm just
adding some on the center whew that
looks not great looks I'm glad I don't
have anywhere major to go today my skin
right now it just looks like I need to
dunk in vaseline or something it looks
like I haven't moisturized in 10 years I
think I could have gone with one shade
up but when I put on bronzer and
everything hopefully it'll be wearable
as 10:12 was called check-in time 10:15
I'm gonna do the rest of my makeup and
hope that some kind of magic can go down
to make my face not look like utter
right now okay so it's now 11:11 ooh
so some time has passed it's been about
an hour have a good look at the
foundation and natural lighting out
there and I think it actually looks
better now that it's kind of warmed up
to my skin a little bit it definitely
still looks dry and patchy in certain
areas I would say my forehead like up
here is where it really doesn't look
good and then down here in this area
like where most of my acne is definitely
wouldn't call this medium or full
coverage off of one layer I think you
can get it up to medium coverage when I
first put it on it did look like a matte
finish would not call this a natural
matte finish this is like straight-up
dry matte but as it's been on my skin a
little bit I mean my forehead looks
pretty dewy at this point I have
highlighter on my nose so that's what
you guys are seeing there but my
forehead too obviously don't have any
highlight around the center of my
forehead and it looks pretty dewy hoping
that doesn't turn into oil throughout
the day so I warmed up my face quite a
bit so I don't like totally washed out
using the ambient bronzers by hourglass
luminous bronze light and diffuse bronze
light I kind of just mix those two
shades get a little bit more of a globe
going on my face I use the Too Faced
Papa don't peach blush highlighter I
tried out this palette it holy-shit sees
this is the BH spotlight palette which
I've been hearing a lot of good things
about I don't know why I hadn't tried it
yet but I actually went in with dream
and it is beautiful I use dream as a
face highlight and then I also have it
on the center of my eyes on the lid and
then I used glow for my inner corner
which is also super pretty eyes like an
inner corner highlight so I'm gonna keep
trying this thing out cuz I really like
it right now i shadow zaccheaus gonna go
in with the subculture palette just to
try it again I have a whole review on it
but I didn't want my eyes to be like
super red and itchy if that was what
irritated me that I went in with its
sister pellet and Nastasia Modern
Renaissance palette when my favorite
eyeshadow with all the matte shades on
my eyes are from here and then my lips
are B hue pretty penny second time is
10:15 I'll see you guys in a few hours
in natural lighting okay so it's now to
13 so foundations been on for about 4
hours as you can see I'm looking pretty
dewy right now I don't mind it at this
point it's not like overly too oily but
I'm definitely getting a bit oily I'm
getting a little bit of creasing right
here yeah I look pretty oily already
around my nose area this is only after 4
hours getting a bit of oil down here as
well but I'm vlogging today
Nicko find an air-conditioned spot to
work because it's way too hot in here to
see you guys at the end of the night
where is like okay I think that looks
pretty accurate actually so right now
it's 855 the Foundation's been on for a
little over ten hours ten and a half
hours as you can see I am very very oily
this I think is tricky on my skin
because it's definitely not a foundation
that off the bat I feel like I could put
a powder on top of like you guys saw it
was so dry so matte when I first put it
on so I feel like I would almost have to
wait like a couple hours to powder my
face which I just don't want to do I'm
not trying to mess around putting makeup
on my face twice throughout the day I
like to put on my makeup have it stay on
throughout the day I definitely have
foundations where that works without a
powder I mean the oil is like out party
right now not only that but I feel like
it's rubbed off in certain parts of my
face like my nose this one is just an
overall no to me this one is one of
those products that I feel like no
matter what your skin type is the fact
that it was so difficult to blend out
and it just has this drag to it which
you don't want mystic foundation I would
say as a pass up one thing I do like
about it is that it definitely didn't
oxidize throughout the day so that's
nice so this is one of those products
that I wouldn't reach for again I won't
be using this again hopefully day number
three will be golden so if you guys
enjoyed this video and you're excited
for the rest of 15 days of foundation
don't forget to give this a thumbs up it
helps me out six campus every time every
single night 15 days love you guys
thanks for watching see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
