little velvet case in here fancy
all right so today clearly it is not
foundation Friday like I mentioned in
last week's video there's not going to
be a foundation Friday video for a
couple weeks because 15 days of
foundation is starting on September 1st
and I've been busy pre filming for that
testing out one of the foundations today
I already filmed that video this morning
I just put on the Maybelline vivid hot
lacquer trying this out in the shade 72
this thing transfers every 0.2 seconds
already blotted like 50 times so we'll
see if this lasts the whole video so I
got some stuff online Sephora I feel
like I haven't showed you guys it's for
a haul in forever and I also wanted to
start picking up some clothes for fall
just like new jackets and things still
like 80 90 degrees in Seattle but I'm
getting ready Macy's and American Eagle
we're both having crazy sales on their
websites they're also double cash back
with Ebates right now for their 24/7
promotion things both sites were having
some really good sales and I was
shopping it was like the Macy's two-day
sale and then American Eagle just had a
 ton of bralette and underwear and
things on sales so I just stocked up if
you haven't tried a base yet they're
freaking amazing
I've talked about them multiple times on
my channel because they're honestly one
of my favorite sites because you
literally get free money for shopping
online use them for years
110 percent recommend them which is why
they are sponsoring today's video so
thank you to Ebates for collaborating
with me on another video basically the
largest cash back site I have a couple
of thousand retailers down there pretty
much any site that you shop online at
will be on eBay so you literally just
commute there use the browser button
which makes it really easy because it
just like pops up for you or you can go
on ebay type in the name of the store
it'll tell you how much cashback it is
and you just click shop now and it like
redirects you to the site and then it
tracks your shopping so I'll have a link
down below for Ebates if this is your
first time on there when you spend $25
on any store you get a $10 welcome bonus
which is pretty sweet by the way I want
to say sorry that Wednesday's video was
sponsored and so as today's the way that
timing worked out with stitching you the
foundation starting and just deadlines
for videos this is the way that it had
to go but I wouldn't be talking about
you BAE's and we won't be doing this
video if I didn't genuinely love them
I'll probably be talking about you babes
till m95 if internet still exists so
let's jump into it alright so I did some
damage on Sephora what's new I picked up
about seven foundations for 15 days of
foundation so you can imagine the
receipt on this thing but I'm not gonna
be showing you guys those because you'll
see them coming maybe I'll show you a
couple of them I'll show you a couple
whenever Sephora or Altos double
cashback that's really good
shop because you save extra money you
can also stack it with coupons you can
still use like your 350 off Ulta coupon
or whatever you have so first thing I
got from swor is a tart clay play face
shaping palette I've heard really good
things about this from multiple people
the packaging is this kind of minds me
of like sunglasses I think with the
tortoise thing going on this has a
shadows and contour shades in here to
get nine eyeshadows and three contour
shades oh it smells bomb okay I thought
I was getting whisk that I have it on my
eyes today use this and my face I
thought I was getting with but I was
like now this isn't two phases start I
was really good that's a win
actually try to both of the lightest
shades today on my faces contour and
actually like the middle one better it's
a bit more cool toned they're very
pigmented but they do blend out so I
don't find it to be like the Urban Decay
Naked shape-shifter palette whatever
that was called wear their way to be
minted and they don't blend out these
ones I feel blend a lot easier the
eyeshadows are gorgeous like I said I
use these all over my eyes today so I
have on right now again pigmented easy
to blend but they don't blend away they
also don't get muddy I use probably like
uneven no.67 shades in here on my eyes
today and I didn't find them getting
super muddy is great so so far I'm
really happy with this it's also hard
for me to find a neutral kind of
everyday palette with a cream shade
that's light enough for my skin tone
that I could just use like all over the
lid and this shade right here solstice I
think it's called yeah this one is light
enough for me to use under my brow bone
and on my lid just sounds like an
everyday kind of color that's usually
what I go for so this is another YouTube
made me buy it purchase this is a
Burberry fresh flow highlighter they had
a bunch of different shades in this and
I decided to go with number three pink
pearl I'm wearing this on my face right
now I tried it out I wanted to put some
of the stuff on my face just go ahead
you know some thoughts on it first of
all the pattern on here is freaking
beautiful it's like this flower super
intricate design on here it's just
beautiful like I just want to stare at
this if I'm going to need to pick up in
more shades because it is gorgeous it
doesn't emphasize your texture this is
like exactly what I think a highlight
should be light gives you the glow but
it almost has it's like wet kind of
sheen to it where it doesn't emphasize
texture doesn't look like an eyeshadow
fits beautifully on the skin I think it
is worth the money okay my camera just
stopped recording and my foot is
completely asleep so that was really fun
trying to press record but off the bat I
love the formula
one this shade I think is really pretty
if you like a light pink kind of
highlight I'm definitely going to pick
up more shades of this one also listen
to that magnetic clothes so good
whoo I didn't even notice there's a
little velvet case in here fancy so
drunk elephant seems to be one of those
brands I can't even focus on what I'm
saying right now because my foot is like
hardcore tingling drunk elephants seems
to be one of those brands that very few
people have negative things to say about
their products it seems like they have
some good tried their vitamin C
firma like the sample size one and I
just have it in my travel makeup bag and
I use it but I don't feel like I've used
it enough to really like notice the
difference I didn't think it was amazing
but I really wanted to try out the TLC
glycolic night serum because that's the
one that people really like rave about
someone with the pink cap on it two full
bottles of these are like eighty ninety
dollars which is whoa so they have these
little travel-size ones you get zero
point two seven ounces in each one this
has the virgin Marilla luxury facial oil
in it and then the TLC one I'm really
just curious about the TLC but I mean
I'm gonna try the other one too some
people on the reviews on Sephora we're
saying that it helps their acne here's
what it looks like I love the neon
Pink's okay so I'm just going to show
you guys two of the foundations that I
picked up for 15 days of foundation the
first is the bare minerals bare Pro
performance liquid foundation a bunch of
you guys have been asking about this so
I got this one and then this they're
just randomly found when I was like
scrolling through Sephora this is so
freaking expensive so I want to see if
it's worth it this is a Tom Ford
waterproof foundation slash concealer
this supposed to be like full coverage I
think this was 85 bucks or something
like that so during 15 days of
foundation we will find out if this
thing is worth $85 these are super
random these are powder lipsticks are
these actually called lip Sephora lip
powders so I picked these up because
Mallory Mallory 17:12 did a video on the
Clinique powder lipsticks and she really
liked those I wanted to try these
because I think there were only five
dollars or something they were like
insanely marks down got the zero - its
natural and then zero for red hot the
Clinique ones apparently give you like a
flush almost like a tinted lip so I'm
curious to see how these ones do what is
this I never actually got my VI B
Rouge card or anything so I don't know
if this is just like a delayed thing
what is this you get a little brush
looks like a little travel brush this
one might be good for concealer and I
think I used my Sephora points Vinnie's
I got the Anastacio clear brow gel and
the sundae Riley UFO acne treatment face
oil I've definitely tried the lunar oil
I think that's what it's called one in
the blue bottle I might have tried to
sample this I don't think I've tried it
like nightly to see if it actually does
anything so I'm going to give this go a
lot of people have good things to say
about Sunday Riley as well lately I've
been hearing a ton about Coto Lee so
they had this little free sample thing
this is their essence concentrate and
it's like a toner
I don't really know I'll have to figure
that out to me this looks like something
you'd probably put on a cotton pad like
after you wash your face and assuming
okay box is empty so it's everything I
got from Sephora let's move on to Macy's
so from today August 18th to the 21st
Macy's American Eagle Eagle that sounded
like an Israeli accent American Eagle
body shop and a few others are actually
double cashback right now so Macy's for
me is kind of like hit or miss but you
can actually find some really cute
things there and pretty good deals
especially when they're having one of
their like major sales so the first
thing I got is actually this pair of
pants I'm gonna be trying everything on
so you guys can see what it looks like
on my body but these I was so pleasantly
surprised by I don't even know what you
call these they remind me of like
balloon pants or something I feel like
there's a better name for these that I
just don't know but these are the
American Rag brand as a size zero
they're kind of high-waisted so
typically I would wear like a three in
pants or like a 25 lately but since
they're high-waisted the zero sent me
perfectly and they actually have this
stretchy back front has a cute button
with this tie there are tons of pockets
on here so it almost has like a cargo
kind of look to it but then the bottoms
crunchy elastics they actually excite
around your ankles
I'm sure I'm 411 usually these kind of
pants make me look like I have zero
shape and they're just way too baggy and
big these are the first ones I've ever
found that actually fit and I think look
really cute they're like tight in all
the right places and baggy in all the
right places they look super cute was
like peep toe heels
and actually pull up my Macy's email so
I can see how much each one of these
were because of them were like way
markdown on sale and doesn't always feel
great
oh yeah I feel like I need to get
another one because these are normally
4450
and I got them for twenty two
ninety-nine on
fail yeah I'm going to get another pair
of these so for the fall and winter I've
been looking for a jacket that's like
warm enough to wear when it gets chilly
out but that actually looks cute and
wouldn't look weird with like nicer
outfits or for going out or whatever so
I wanted to find something that was a
little bit more stylish but still warm
and practical so I actually found this
down a bomber jacket I had a few
different colors in this one
I just got black because I felt like I
would wear this more usually in jackets
I'm an extra-small I had to get the size
small in this one and I think it is a
tiny bit big I definitely could have
gone with extra small but they were sold
out of that one it's really comfortable
at least with this size I could wear
like a sweatshirt or something
underneath like a hoodie if I wanted to
I think this would look really cute just
everyday with like jeans and stuff or
also dressed up with an outfit a normal
price isn't on this one I got it for
59.99 I want to say it was normally like
80 bucks maybe even more than that this
one might have been actually one of the
major markdowns I can't remember okay
memory card just got full but we are
back in action so I have a couple things
that were like total sales that I'm
definitely going to be returning the
first is this can like sleeveless vest
jacket kind of thing the style this is Q
it's just way too big and baggy on me
this is Ralph Lauren size 4 I think the
2 was sold out I've been looking for a
coat like this in this color to keep
looking and I'm going to turn that but
this one was look at the price
holy-shit see so this was normally $195
would have never paid that for that and
I got it for 44 dollars and 96 cents I
want to kind of lightweight jackets that
I could just throw on with anything in
the fall when it starts getting like a
little bit chilly again I think I should
have got the size - I think they're just
a little bit too big I got a tan one and
a black one of this jacket a little bit
too baggy in the arms and the shoulders
this is like a little bit too boxy so
I'll be returning these but this was
originally 69 and I got it for 20
dollars and 86 cents actually have this
exact shirt from Macy's in a like dark
mauve color and I love the fit and style
of this it's like a short sleeve flowy
has a side typing and it's super soft
this is the American Rag brand maybe I
should just stick with that brand
because clearly I like them I have the
size small this was originally 29 50 and
I got it for 1499 a member I got the
other one on sale but it definitely
wasn't 1499
really love wearing tank tops if I can
find a short sleeve shirt that's like
cool enough to wear in the summer and
stuff is cute and it's also short which
is great super soft really like this so
this dress I thought was going to be a
little bit different as you can see
maybe hopefully on the girl it looks
like it's tied at the top and then kind
of flowy maybe I just got a size too
small I got the size extra small but
it's pretty tight across like everywhere
I didn't try this one on but I do love
the sleeve length and everything and
it's a super super soft material and
what feels like those pajama bottoms the
top is like elastic which I'm not the
biggest fan of because sometimes it can
just make your shoulders not look the
most flattering I think I'm going to
return this one doesn't have the
original price on here but that was
$24.99 this is another off-the-shoulder
one but I really like this it's just a
loose flowy kind of top with these
really cute side tie things on the
sleeves
I just tried this on and got deodorant
all over it so we can ignore that the
only thing with this one is that you
have to wear it pretty high up on your
chest for it to be flat and it's kind of
hard to move in it so if you're going to
be doing like a lot of arm raising and
walking around in things it might be
kind of annoying to keep like pulling it
down but it is really cute and it's
flattering I like the way this looks I
like that it's flowy it some was only
$14.99 so it's a super good deal and I
got the size small so last thing I got a
Macy's are some new high-top converse
I've been really into the white high-top
converse I've been wearing them like
multiple times a week with pretty much
anything I just have black ones way back
in the day but I don't have them anymore
so I just picked up some black high-top
converse actually get the kids in
conference because they are do you run
huge so I get a kid's size too but these
were 30 4.99 so I don't think they were
on sale but you do still get cash back
so I went slightly crazy on American
Eagle everything was on sale I had to
you know when you get those moves where
you just want all new underwear and bras
that's kind of where my head was at like
how did they get so worn out so quickly
I feel like I throw out underwear and
get new ones really quickly such as me
maybe I'm just getting really cheap ones
I actually have never tried the American
Eagle underwear I don't think so this is
the first time so hopefully they're good
quality
I have tried their bra less and I picked
up a ton more two again American Eagles
double cashback right now but what
started this whole madness is that all
their bra let's were on sale for $15
which is really good deal because their
bra let's are normally $30 so I got this
really pretty colors like not really
showing up it's like this periwinkle
lacy super-pretty bralette I got the
size medium and all of them this almost
has like neoprene neoprene so to school
yeah the neoprene material on the inside
it was like really nice quality it's
like kind of thick so I got a bunch of
bralette and I was like well I might as
well get matching underwear you know I'm
saying look at the color of this I love
this one's like bright orange with this
blue flower then I got this pair to
match those lace two songs there's
another lacy briella it just peach color
and this one has like the double straps
which I really like I like how they have
the lace going below the boobage about
the matching underwear for that one this
one I love because I feel like I'll get
a lot of use out of this one it's just a
white lacy bra let it almost has like
coarse that kind of lines done it but I
like it because it's not like low-cut or
anything it's just a straight across for
all that and it actually has this like
inside lining kind of like a built-in
cami bras not the matching periwinkle
underwear and then literally just got a
 ton of sleazy underwear their
underwears normally twelve fifty and I
got each one for three dollars and fifty
cents and then this top which is so
freakin soft it's a one-shoulder side
what do you call these as a super cute
cutout thing right on the shoulder
this was seven dollars and 98 cents on
sale I got this size small and the
material of this feels so nice super
soft and it's a little bit thick which I
like I'm always on the lookout for good
filming toss which sounds ridiculous but
it is kind of hard could you only see
like here up so you have a really
limited space to wear like a cute top
right I think does everything I got that
was exhausting feel like that was a
really long haul but I hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did make sure you give
