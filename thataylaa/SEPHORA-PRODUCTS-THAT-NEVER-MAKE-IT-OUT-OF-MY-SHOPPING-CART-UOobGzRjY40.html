in the next five years
think I'm a little seasonally confused
right now stove the pumpkin candle going
but we got the Christmas flannel alright
so today we're gonna be talking about
the products that never make it out of
the Sephora cart and into my hands these
they're like the products that I put
back and forth five billion times they
end up just staying in my love section
which is like can give a product hard-on
Sephora puts it in your loves which I
actually just recently discovered like a
few months ago not like I've been
shopping on Sephora for ten years or
anything how long has the four have been
around I'm actually curious damn what
Sephora has been around since 1970
alright since everyone is just dying to
know this fact Sephora was founded in
France in 1970 and in 1997 it was
acquired by Louboutin anyways don't
remember where I was going with that so
the love section on Sephora kind of
bookmarks it so you can come back and
purchase it later put it in your cart or
just keep staring at it like I do so I
got this idea when I was shopping the
vib sale and I was looking through my
love's about the things that I just
still couldn't purchase just could not
get myself to do it either these
products are like absurdly expensive or
I'm just on the fence about them and I
can't decide I thought this might be an
interesting video for you guys just so
you can see kind of what I've been
debating getting and I'll talk about why
I haven't made the purchase yeah and let
me know down below if any of these
products you think I should purchase is
that that'll help me you know push me
over the edge so if you like this video
idea make sure you give this a thumbs up
it helps me out if you're new here you
can join the burrito family and
subscribe upload every Monday Wednesday
Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time alright
I'm gonna show you my beauty bag my
love's
this feels kind of personal feel like
I'm letting you into my home right now
so the first one I actually talked about
on snapchat
a couple weeks ago I know this is by
herbivore which is fairly new to Sephora
but they're actually a seattle-based
brand which i think is just very
exciting like good for them they started
as a Seattle kind of indie brand and now
they're on friggin Sephora I don't know
why but the name herbivore just makes me
think of carnivore and then my mind just
like those places but this is their
Phoenix still regenerating facial oil
they have a blue lat piece la piece oil
as well which I've heard is better for
like oily combination skin since I'm on
accutane I am into facial oils right now
one that's not gonna clog my pores I've
been getting
closed comedones basically like the tiny
bumps that never actually turn into
whiteheads really they just are kind of
like underneath your skin and I think
it's from the jojoba oil I've been using
trying to find a good night oil that
won't clog my pores but will give me
that moisture and this Phoenix oil has
gotten really good reviews
not only on Sephora but by people who
actually know their when it comes
to skincare here's the thing this oil is
$88 $88 which i believe is more than the
full sized version of the drunk elephant
oil which it's also on here you do get
1.7 ounce as a product it says it's
formulated with no fillers and effective
natural ingredients it absorbs easily
blah blah fatty acids I've just heard
amazing things about this oil there's
something about the herbivore packaging
I know it's not about the packaging but
packaging is important to me like makes
me want to reach for a product more it's
a bonus when it has good packaging and
something about the herbivore packaging
for all of their products just draws me
in so I don't know just turn you aside
if it's worth it the next oil I have on
here is the drunk elephant virgin
Murillo luxury face oil so basically I'm
deciding between that one and the
Phoenix oil right now I do like the
drunk Alvin came out with a smaller size
so for $40 you get the smaller size of
this if you watch YouTube this is one of
those oils that I'm sure you have heard
about drunk Alvin is kind of notorious
for having great all-around ingredients
the full-size retails for $72 but you
only get one ounce of product so more
expensive probably ounce wise I'm not
doing the math in my head right now
then the herb or one deeply moisturizes
nourishes sues rejuvenates a lot of
people swear by this oil it has almost 5
stars first few are skin care because
that's just what I've been most into
lately started watching Carolyn hi
Rennes and Gotham ista and that's our
channel I'll have both them linked down
below but they're both like very
knowledgeable when it comes to skincare
and two eye creams that Gotham East
recommended shadow L video that I was
watching with a bunch of recommendations
but the two that kind of stood out to me
for what I'm looking for
was the tatcha luminous deep hydration
firming eye serum and then the drunk
elephant Shaba complex eye serum so I'm
deciding between these two the drunk
elephant retails for $60 and the Tatra
retails for $85 holy both you get
zero point 5 ounces
I'm willing to invest in an eye product
I just want something that's gonna help
prevent wrinkles in the future I feel
like if you start now got a start now
prevention people prevention when I'm
kind of leaning towards is the tatcha
solely because it has an applicator that
I feel like I'll just use eye creams are
kind of one of those things every night
where I'm like just an extra step do I
want to do it is it worth it
but if it has kind of a squeeze tube
applicator with the cooling tip it's
just so much easier to glide on you
don't have to like dig your finger into
a product or get stuff under nails the
Tatra has that kind of applicator it's
also kind of cooling which I'm into I
love the feeling of coolness underneath
your eyes it's so refreshing all right
what's next up oh this guy this is a 26
friggin dollar lip balm but people swear
by this thing this is the fresh sugar
advanced therapy lip treatment I don't
know man people get really into this but
it's $26 for a lip balm which I feel
like is just kind of outrageous I mean
I've been using the aqua for healing
ointment that is what's like six or
seven bucks I want to say maybe less
than that and it works friggin amazing I
do love the bite agave mask also one
that I've been using that one's a little
bit more pricey but there's something
just about the fact that this is a lip
balm like just a stick bomb I don't know
if I can do it next is an eyeshadow
palette that you can probably guess
because one is ridiculously expensive
too everyone raves about this three I
have never talked about this brand
because I don't own anything by this
brand I don't know if I can proceed with
this product through my card that
sentence made no sense this is the busy
art eyeshadow palette the one I'm most
interested in is the neutral matte zero
one that lower row really appeals to me
with a couple pull tone chase in there
but they can also have some nice really
light transition shades and it looks
like a light light cream almost a white
in there based on the picture but then
you also have some really nice deep rich
warm tones the way I'm talking about
this I feel like I should just put it in
my car right now I'm kind of like
selling myself on it was so close to
getting this during the Sephora vib sale
but then I think about the price and $80
for an eyeshadow palette is so friggin
expensive I don't know man I feel like
this would have to be an eyeshadow
palette that I would use
almost every single day for it to be
worth it to me I do like the size of it
it would be easy to travel with is it
worth it one of life's unanswered
questions okay so next up is a lipstick
by bite BB this is their amuse-bouche
lipstick I always want to say image
bouche when I say that this has four
thousand four hundred almost five-star
reviews think I have a small sample size
of one of their lipsticks floating
around this is just always the type of
thing where I wanted to try it because
people rave about the formula of these
but at the same time I rarely use actual
lipsticks I have a few go twos all of
which are actually from the drugstore
but for the most part I like to use
liquid lipsticks because I feel like
they just stay on my lips better I don't
have to worry about them coming off
throughout the day so that's kind of why
I haven't just bit the bullet and who
got that and gotten the bite
ud lipstick for $26 I just don't know if
I would get enough use out of it next we
have another lipstick this is by NARS as
their audacious lipstick this is pretty
much the same exact thing reasoning for
me as the bite Beauty one I've heard so
many good things about it but this
retails for $34 and this one also has
five star is 1700 reviews do I need to
in my life I don't know
for some reason I just got a flashbac of
using maybe I have one of those floating
around somewhere I have no idea you know
those products that you have some kind
of weird association to something with
it where you just can't you just can't
buy it that's the benefit hello flawless
oxygen Wow liquid foundation for me
something about having the word oxygen
Wow in there just makes me think of
being orange and makes me think it's
gonna oxidize I know it's not logical I
just have that association in my head
that I can't get out I literally think
I've put this in and out of my cart for
at least a year now probably over a year
I'm definitely gonna get at some point
for a foundation Friday
it just doesn't appeal to me next is a
face wash it's the philosophy purity
made simple cleanser I don't think I've
ever heard anyone say anything bad about
this cleanser have you it's supposed to
be kind of just a gentle all around
all-purpose non-stripping kind of
cleanser it has 10,000 for point it
looks like 2 5 stars
retails for $24 but you get eight ounces
of product so it's like a huge huge
bottle this has been on my loves list
since before I went on my skincare binge
so I think I found a couple other face
washes that I'm more keen to try now so
I don't know if this will stay in my
loves list but for now it's just chillin
here so next up is another foundation
this foundation retails for $110 I think
the most expensive foundation I've tried
was the Tom Ford waterproof foundation
that I did in the 15 days foundation
last series I think that was $85 this
isn't a new product it's just a new to
of Sephora which is why it has a little
tag on it people love this foundation
I've heard it's like a foundation that
looks just very skin-like
as someone who has acne those
foundations never typically worked for
me on their own so I'm kind of holding
off until after I'm off of accutane to
see how this one would work for me
that's kind of why this has just been
staying in my loves list I am very
curious though if $110 foundation is
worth it next up is a eyeshadow palette
that Sephora released when was that
maybe like six months ago now the
Sephora Pro warm palette they also
released the brights one and then like a
cool toned one warm tone one is really
if I was going to get one I would get
that one not that I need any other warm
tone palettes mostly just to try out for
you guys I feel like lately especially
I've been more drawn to cool tones I
don't know if it's just a winter kind of
thing or what I just haven't been really
feeling the warm tones quite as much
just palette retails for $68 so it's not
cheap palette it's just this little
mission but I mean come on a lot of
times brands do that just so you buy it
right away
so mo you know I'm saying this one I
think would mainly be a purchase to
review for you guys and just try out so
let me know if you want to see that if
bunch of you do want to see that then I
would get it this thing I have have no
words I'm like my eyes are getting
watery just thinking about this this is
the Natasha de Nona eyeshadow palette
the one that I am more drawn towards is
the green brown one just because I don't
feel like I have quite as many
eyeshadows that look like this the $80
busy art palette is looking like a steal
compared to this thing this palette is
two hundred and thirty nine dollars
it's almost comical one why is it that
much - what the
three how badly do I need this in my
life this is another one those products
that people swear by I think I've heard
more good things about the sunset
palette I think it's called this would
be another purchase that would be mostly
just to use and show for you guys to see
if it's worth it because if I didn't do
YouTube there is no freaking way oh it's
been two hundred forty dollars on an
eyeshadow palette which again I'm like
even if I did a video on that how many
people are gonna spend two hundred forty
dollars on eyeshadow palette apparently
each pan is quite large did you get zero
point zero eight ounces per pan kasha I
just can't do it I can't do it next is a
highlighter this is the CIA London glow
- highlighter I picked up where is it I
just had it on here blush
during the Sephora vib sale this is in
the shade summer love and I've been
loving summer love their highlighters
I think Mallory really loves it Mallory
17/12 I think Mallory's the one that
really likes their highlighters I think
that's why I put it in my cart
originally they retail for $32 they only
have 18 reviews I'm sure this is one
that I'll put in my car at some point
and actually follow through with it but
for now I just haven't had the urge but
not that I know that I like this lot I'm
kind of more inclined to try the
highlighter next up is another eyeshadow
palette we are mowing the lawn right now
huh
this is another one that I've heard so
much about it's only 46 dollars which
only because compared to the other ones
are talking about this is like a deal at
this point but this is the tarte toasted
tartlet palette I've heard a lot about
this in the last few months this is a
fairly new product the only reason why
I'm on the fence about this is because
if you saw my five eye shadows I regret
buying the Tarte tartlet Paulo is in
there I just I'm not a fan I'm not a fan
so I'm kind of worried that's gonna be
the same formula in the tartlet toasted
palette future I both let me know down
below if you find them to be similar I
probably should got that one during the
vib sale so the last product is also by
benefit and it's our hello flawless
powder foundation I've had this in my
love list / card multiple times probably
for two years I don't know why I can't
follow through with it I like using
powder foundations
on top of my foundation just to give it
some extra coverage and I like the
powders that are kind of more fine so it
doesn't look like you have a foundation
on top of foundation that's just
basically a powder that has a little bit
more coverage for example the Laura
Geller balance and Brighton powder one
of my favorites that just gives the
beautiful finish it adds a little bit of
coverage I wouldn't wear on its own but
I love it for setting my foundation so
that's usually what I use powder
foundation for and this one is
apparently very beautiful has a really
nice finish from what I've read so I
will try this at some point maybe in the
next five years time will tell so those
are all of the products currently in my
love's list that have been in and out of
my cart out of all of those let me know
which ones you guys think I need in my
life which ones do you want to see
videos on if a bunch of you wanted to
see videos on a certain product I would
definitely get it decisions decisions
first world problems right here what
products to put in your Sephora cart if
you enjoyed this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
