know it's classy alright so today we
have a haul video I think every time I
mentioned that we have a haul video
there's like this sense of guilt in my
voice so this happened size of these
bags are deceiving actually got things
that have been on my list for a while or
things that I needed so don't feel too
much virus remorse right now so we're
gonna start out with Victoria's Secret I
have been needing a new bra
for way too long the lady there measured
me for the first time ever and I found
out that I've been wearing the wrong
size bra my entire life so this is a bra
that I guy I've never tried this style
from Victoria's Secret before I feel
like every bra that I've ever bought
from Victoria's Secret it just didn't
fit me right I don't think I've ever had
a bra that completely fit me right
besides the true &amp;amp; Co bras and I have
bras that actually fit my boobs I feel
like it looks completely flat and shirts
which I don't like so I wanted to get
something that like had some shape to it
but also actually what style is this
this is the padded perfect coverage I
think it was called the t-shirt bra
added t-shirt bra comfort t-shirt but
half Naturals a perfect shape t-shirt
bra thanks Marjorie from Victoria's
Secret this just literally fit me
perfectly thumbs up for having a bra
that actually fits the other thing I got
a Victoria Secret which was a total
impulse buy was a phone case I have it
on my phone right now I actually really
really like this and I've been looking
for a new phone case I thought it was
white in the store but it's actually
like a really light pink and then it has
this gold bow it's a nice like leathery
material it actually has more protection
than I was expecting it goes all the way
around which is nice so if you drop it
like that it's gonna hit the case not
the actual phone I like that I got one
pair of underwear for my Tori secret
don't ask me why I only got one I feel
like that's kind of pointless but I
don't you guys can tell but it's kind of
like like a V thing I don't know I liked
it this was just from the pink section
and it's a nice spandexy material next
let's just go into Sephora so I actually
had a lot of stuff on my list that I
wanted to get at Sephora been thinking
about it for a while and I finally just
splurged and did it I was kind of
regretting the decision I made
returning the YSL fusion ink foundation
this is in the shade b10 and is just
what is floating over there actually did
a whole review on this product which
I'll link down below and over here like
always to be honest it's not that much
different than the like eight dollar
Maybelline
dream wonder foundation that I also love
except the shade in this is just perfect
to me it doesn't oxidize throughout the
day it's pale enough without mixing
anything in it's lighter than the
Maybelline Dream wonder and it also has
a little bit more coverage than the
dream wonder I just kind of regretted
returning this and so I picked it up
again it is $60 it's why I sell like
this is a freaking classy foundation it
comes in a gold box that's how you know
it's classy it's pricey but it's
something to me that is worth it because
now I know that I actually really like
it you know I'm saying next thing I
picked up is the benefit gimme brow in
the shade medium deep I don't know if
there's a darker shade than this but I
just asked the guy to like go digging in
the drawer this was the darkest one that
they had this is basically a brush on a
fiber gel for your brows alright my card
just got full so attempt number two for
filming this don't remember where we
were but I think we're talking about
this I don't think I mentioned this in
the intro but I did film a shadow and
schmooze on the look I'm wearing right
now it should be up before this video I
think yes I use this product in the
video on my brows so if you want to see
how it applies you can watch that but so
far I really like it it added a lot of
like color and volume to my brows that
sounds weird but I just like completely
filled them in if you don't like to fill
in your brows but you want something
just give them a little bit more
something-something and like keep your
hairs in place this will totally do it I
was actually really impressed somehow
like this color just like appeared and
hair it was weird
now my battery's low we're gonna do this
next I got the ciate don't know how to
say this
she opted a who knows this is a mini
speed coat top coat I haven't heard
anything about this but friend there was
trying it on her nails and it looked so
freakin shiny so I decided to pick this
up I'm wearing it on my nails right now
I just payin my nails last night makes
your nail polish dry in like under a
minute and a half and it just looks like
you got your nails done at the salon
this was like totally something that I
was not planning on getting ever I don't
know why I was like anti Beauty Blender
but I just love my Real Techniques
sponge and I thought for $6 why do I
need the Beauty Blender I still don't
know the answer to that I might be doing
a comparison video let me know in the
comments if you guys would want to see
that there's just some moments where I
wonder if I'm missing out I just didn't
want the doubt to be there anymore you
know the last thing I got at Sephora is
a two-faced
did lipstick this is a long we're
liquefied lipstick and these have been
out for a while now I don't know why
they didn't appeal to me at all I think
because they remind me of the LA girl
Blaise lip pain I just was not a fan of
though got all over my teeth and I just
wasn't a fan so it's kind of like put
off by these cuz it reminded me of that
I finally tried it on in Ulta a couple
weeks ago
and it felt amazing on my lips it looks
good it like just smooths over all the
cracks in your lips super pigmented and
this isn't the shaded Milton nude there
were a couple of like the lighter nudey
pink shades that I was really drawn to I
just watch it for you guys and we're in
the pretty sponge that's how much I love
you so does a darker nude there's the
color they're super pigmented I
literally put a drop on and just blend
it out with the sponge
you smell like candy excited about this
I have a couple things to show you from
American Eagle I've been on a mission to
find a pair of jean shorts that don't
show your ass it is actually
surprisingly difficult to find so I
found these at American Eagle what
they're like stretchy they remind me of
like jeggings but their short version
let me just show you and get out of
frame yourself this is what they look
like they are high-waisted but to me
that's fine because I'll just wear a
normal shirt over it or wear
high-waisted who knows the thing I
really liked is that it didn't have the
typical American Eagle pocket on it
there's nothing on the back pockets
they're super stretchy and comfortable I
wouldn't order these online because I
literally tried like 20 different styles
and I was different sizes in every
single style so I feel like you just
have to go into the store and try these
on I thought I was paying 39.95 for
these and they rung up as 1495 steel the
other thing I got is this tank top which
fits really cute it's just like a
high-neck tank top they had these in a
couple different colors they had like a
striped pattern the material of this is
so soft part of the reason why I love
American Eagle is because you can just
tell that they're made with like quality
material my washing machine has been
eating up my shirts lately I've
literally had to throw away ten shirts
because it's doing something weird my
deodorant it's literally like staining
patches of white on my clothing that I
can't get out pull out their story so I
need new shirts they'll be nice in the
summer with like a bando or something
it's just really lightweight and
comfortable alright so that was
everything that I got if we wrap up this
video without the battery dying it's
gonna be a freaking miracle
knowing my luck it'll die like 10
seconds
or the otros finish if you guys like
this video and you want to see more haul
videos give it a thumbs up so I know it
is freaking hot as balls right now
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
