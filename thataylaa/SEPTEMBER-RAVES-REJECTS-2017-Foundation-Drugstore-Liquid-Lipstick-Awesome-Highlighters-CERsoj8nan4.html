all right so today it is September Ray's
and rejects these are my favorite and
least favorite products of the last
couple months I didn't have that many
new favorites in August and then 15 days
of foundation happened
it's October what the heck I feel like
it's gonna go by so fast and it's gonna
be the holidays and then it's gonna be
summer again we're just life go all of
my raves are gonna be linked down below
I also have a lot of rejects I have a
lot of rejects month I just film the 15
days of foundation and wrap a video I'll
put that in the little I over here but
that's why I look exactly the same it's
a two-in-one video kind of day I'm in
like major pre filming mode because I'm
gonna be gone some of the products I'm
talking about I'm wearing on my face
right now so you can see how they
actually look on I just talked for like
three hours filming the other video so
now I'm my brain is half working this is
gonna be a fun one if you enjoy this
video while you're watching and you like
raves and rejects don't forget to give
this a thumbs up let's get into it
probably like five things in here that
you guys can 100% guess because I've
been just talking about them so much and
using them at videos and everything
first one is the milk makeup blur liquid
foundation dude this foundation is bomb
this looks so beautiful on my skin if
you have a lot of texture and you find
that foundations usually cling to your
skin in weird places
this one just smooths out your skin it
has great coverage full coverage the
shade of it works really well for me I'm
in the shade fair I have a few different
videos using this foundation you can
just search it on YouTube the tail up
puts the name of the foundation any
videos I have using a specific
foundation will come up if you do that
if ever a way to apply this to make it
last throughout the day on my oily skin
is by setting it with the maybelline
loose fit me powder I talked about that
in July raisin rejects I also have a
full video doing that exact routine so
I'll put that in eye gorgeous foundation
I feel like I am almost out of this I'm
like down to here this is the Revlon
Photoready pore reducing primer another
thing you've heard me talk about 10
is primary I don't think makes my makeup
last any longer but it definitely helps
to fill my pores like it says pore
reducing primer I also like that they're
just like real about it they don't say
like pore eraser or anything drastic
it's just gonna reduce your pores and
that's exactly what it does it has a
nice formula to it this doesn't break me
out which is nice it's really hard
finding primers that don't break me out
especially poor kind of filling primers
like benefit Porefessional breaks out my
skin horribly this
I don't find it makes my skin any worse
it's from the drugstore it's great so I
got this a few weeks ago and I've been
reaching for this ever since I first put
it on my face this is the hourglass
Holliday absolute strobe light metallic
okay what is the actual name of this
ambient metallic strobe lighting palette
this has three different highlighter
shades and at first looking in here I
thought I was only gonna be able to use
the kind of like yellowy white light
shade in here but I can actually wear
all three of these shades they go on the
face a lot lighter than they look in the
pan my favorite way to wear this is by
just mixing all three shades together
it's what's on my face right now I like
this because you can kind of build it up
you can get a very metallic very intense
highlight but it still looks nice on the
skin it doesn't emphasize texture it's
it's on my skin really well I love it as
a nose highlight I also love it as an
inner corner highlight as eyeshadow it's
beautiful these are very different from
the other ambient lighting palette those
ones are much more natural-looking this
is like a full-on metallic highlighter
if you like the metallic wet kind of
highlighter look you would probably love
these here's some finger swatches of all
three shades as you can see I think
especially the pink one looks a lot
lighter then it does in the pan and the
brown kind of bronze e-1 definitely
still wearable in my skin tone this
palette I've also been reaching for a
 ton this is the Smashbox contour
palette something about this light shade
that is just so easy and never looks bad
and never looks muddy it looks good with
any look it's not too warm it's not too
cool it's not like the most cool toned
contour is kind of like in-between a
warm and a cool tone to me is pretty
neutral there's the word the shade is
way warm on my skin tone but if I'm like
really looking ghostly or something I
can use it or mop my face I love both of
those as eyeshadows as well though I
like to just pop them in the crease you
guys will see me use this in the
everyday makeup look coming up if you
don't like shimmery blushes you won't
like this product off the bat but this
is the Too Faced Papa don't peach blush
for me personally I don't find that it's
shimmery to the point where it
emphasizes the texture on my face or
anything I just find it to be a really
flattering tone the thing I love about
this is the formula it's one of those
blushes we're just super effortlessly
blends out it's not too pigmented so
it's not like difficult to blend you
don't have to worry about getting too
much on your brush again I freaking hate
this end of this
not my thing that the actual blush in
the shade of this is just a really nice
peachy tone it's not too overpowering
very flattering if you have fair skins
on my third finger right here again if
you like matte blushes don't go for this
because this obviously has a bit of a
sheen to it next one is actually a
makeup product from Essie I did a full
face using Ft makeup and this was one of
the gems from that video in that video I
had a little sample pack of it I ended
up getting the full size this is the P
Renata medium matte contouring powder in
alluring this is actually the more that
I use it it's more of a fair-skinned
bronzer to me it's gonna warm up your
face but it's not to oranjee which is
really hard to find I think I said it in
that video but this to me is like
exactly what the benefit hoola light
should have been there's the color right
there maybe I'll swatch it against the
Smashbox just so you guys can see the
tone difference
definitely not super cool tones I
wouldn't really say it's a contour shade
but again really nice light bronzer if
you're fair let's watch it next to
Smashbox yeah much warmer than Smashbox
oh there's the Smashbox contour there's
the P renata you also need the tiniest
amount of this so I feel like it would
last a really long time I'm wearing it
on my face right now as a bronzer I also
have a little bit up on my temples I am
in love with the setting spray again I
have mentioned this 5000 times in recent
videos but this is the Too Faced
hangover three-in-one primer and setting
spray I don't like using this as a
primer as much as I do a setting spray
it settles your powder into your liquid
foundation just everything on your face
that kind of just brings it together and
settles everything wearing it right now
on top of my foundation it has more of
like a dewy kind of finish to it so if
you like matte you wouldn't like this
but I just find that it helps make my
makeup look a little bit more natural a
little bit less makeup e.8 and I feel
like my makeup actually stays on better
I was playing around with like powder
foundations and just powder products and
I sprayed one half of my face with this
and left the other half without it and
made all of the powders like pop and
just look amazing and as I was taking
off my makeup with a wipe this side was
so much harder to get off which I feel
like is a good sign for actually kind of
sticking or makeup to your face and
really keeping it on there it does have
a coconut scent which I personally love
but it's silicone free alcohol-free oil
free and it has coconut water so this
doesn't break me out I really
like this and it took me a while to like
this it wasn't like instant love this
highlighter is so freaking pretty I've
use this in a few different videos as
well this is the Burberry fresh glow
pink pearl number three this is the only
thing I brought with me to London I wear
this every single day and it just
freakin pops this is another like
metallic kind of highlight which totally
shocked me because most of Burberry's
other makeup is more natural I purchased
this because I saw a few videos of
people using this and it just was that
like wet kind of look which I usually
love in a highlighter and it definitely
is they have a few other shades in this
I really want to try out the white one
because they actually have like a pure
white highlight version of this it is
pricey but if you want something more
high-end I also love the packaging of
this I mean look at the design on here
it's like this really pretty intricate
design and then it has a magnetic
clothes so nice okay so finally what is
on my eyes I was snapping this morning
and got so many questions about what
eyeshadow I'm wearing so as a base I
have on the Makeup Forever aqua XL in
the shade l22 which is a super pretty
like navy color this is not a rave I
mean I love these I mentioned them in a
past raisin reject but I do have that
down as a base so the colors are a
little bit altered but the rest of my
shadows are the Jacqueline Hill morphe
palette which this was again was not
like an instant love kind of thing I
liked it when I first used it I wasn't
totally blown away I only like this with
a really good base down underneath the
Mac Paint Pot is what I really love with
it you definitely need a primer of these
I'm not gonna go like super in-depth
because you guys have probably seen five
thousand videos well using this palette
so far but I keep finding myself
reaching for this warm tones in here are
beautiful the metallic shades are
beautiful I've worn this in a few
different videos again but I just really
find myself reaching for the neutral
shades on like an everyday basis I love
these darker Browns for the lower lash
line kind of green shade that you see on
the lid is this shade right here I also
went in with this kind of dark army
green shade which is in my crease some
of the lighter matte brown shades and
then these on my lower lash line this
shade as a face highlighter is unreal it
is so freakin pretty keep reaching for
this and I really like this palette so
the last makeup rave of the month is
l'oreal infallible mattes lip paint
thing in the shade tongue
I didn't want to wear this today even
though this looks kind of similar to it
only because I've worn this fifty
thousand times in recent videos I didn't
want it to be overkill right now I have
on the Too Faced melted matte in the
shade cool girl that's what's on my lips
this on my skin tone is one of those
darker nude shades that's still very
wearable for everyday it doesn't look
too dark not like a really weird angle
right now so there's the two shades next
to each other L'Oreal is on the okay
this is not wanting to stay focused
right now L'Oreal is on the bottom two
faces on the top
it always looks great I really like the
formula of these it kind of reminds me
of these two for a liquid lipsticks it's
not super moisturizing but it's also not
super drying it lasts pretty well
throughout the day I don't really have
to touch it up if I'm eating like super
oily food it'll come off on the middle
and I touch it up but for the most part
it's not one that is gonna like it slide
around doesn't transfer to your teeth in
the formulas pretty lightweight so I
think I mentioned this in a rave some
rejects video probably about a year ago
I want to say but I still use it almost
every single day so I wanted to mention
it again this is the lineage lip
sleeping mask I actually don't like
using this I mean I'll use it at night
and I'll sleep in it but I actually like
using it on my no makeup days because it
gives your lips this super pretty plump
kind of light pink color this is what I
was wearing in the lash extension video
it's what I'm wearing on snapchat if I'm
not wearing makeup literally any time
you see me without a face of makeup on
and my lips are like glossy this is what
I'm wearing I have used up about half of
this jar I don't usually like sweet
sense at all but this one I really like
it has almost like a strawberry scent
but doesn't smell like lip smackers like
it's a almost like a sophisticated
strawberry if you will I did try the
Korres lip butter cuz I've heard really
good things about that and I definitely
don't like it as much I don't feel like
it looks as flattering on my lips it
almost like emphasizes the dryness which
is weird this one just makes your lips
look super plump just good makes your
lips look good I have been on the hunt
for a good hairspray for a while now for
years I used one that I got back in
Jordan and I haven't been able to locate
the same hairspray ever since then I've
been trying to find a hairspray that I
like just as much this is the living
proof flex shaping hairspray to try this
out I just got the travel size that's
usually what I like to do is before
because then you can just try it out
and if you don't like it you don't have
to like commit to the full-size and then
also you can travel with this obviously
this hairspray got really good reviews
and I see why it is not crunchy it's not
sticky it smells friggin amazing and
that's what all the reviews were saying
and I was like okay this can either go
really well or really not well because I
feel like a lot of times the sense that
other people like I just really don't
like but this one this could be a
perfume and you you almost can't wear
perfume when you wear this which could
be a good or a bad thing because it is
so heavily scented I do find that it
really lingers in your hair and when
you're walking you can like smell it I
brought this on my trip with me and it
just locks in your curls and it doesn't
leave your hair feeling or looking
hairspray at all this is a bomb hair
spray if you're in the market for a new
one I also love the matte black
packaging
alright so my last wave of the month is
kind of random it's just a body lotion
this is the Aveeno skin relief gentle
scent lotion in the scent nourishing
coconut
I am super into coconut sense even for
the Fall I'm about it all year round a
vino is one of those brands that never
really appealed to me I think mostly
because the packaging I really don't
like their packaging I was on Amazon
trying to find a good body lotion that
actually worked because I feel like
every body lotion I use doesn't actually
help dryness I have some dryness unlike
my knees that have started in my elbows
and also starting accutane soon I just
want to find a really good moisturizing
body lotion that actually does something
cuz my whole body is gonna get really
dry this one definitely works it's a
tiny bit sticky which I don't mind
because I feel like it just like coats
my whole body and I stay in there I put
this on at night after I shower I'll
sleep in it now when I wake up my skin
isn't sticking to you more but it
definitely feels moisturize I know if
you know is generally good if you have
eczema I don't have eczema but I do find
a lot of products break me out on my
body like on my shoulders and my chest
and everything and this one I don't
think has been making my acne on my body
any worse and also we need to talk about
smell of this it's coconut but it's like
perfumey coconut if that makes sense the
smell is way better than I thought it
was going to it doesn't smell like
straight-up coconut there's something
else in here
maybe almond yeah it kind of smells like
coconut almond
if you have dry skin or if you need a
good body moisturizer would recommend
okay I feel like this video has been
held on already so I'm going to try and
power through these rejects right now
because we have a shit-ton this was like
the month of reject oil cleansers for me
I have three here I believe all three of
these are new products cuz I got all
three of these in PR this is the
Dermalogica
pre cleanse balm this is the Olay
Henriksen wonder feel double cleanser
and then this is the glam glow galactic
cleanse hydrating jelly bomb cleanser so
the thing with these is that they do the
job they take off your makeup they just
leave the makeup on your face these are
the kind of oil cleansers where when you
go to wash it off it feels like you're
just rubbing oil for five thousand hours
and none of the makeup is coming off in
the sink it just kind of like leaves the
oil and the makeup on your skin so you
either have to go in with a cleanser
just to get the oil off or you have to
use like a washcloth and a cleanser
absolutely hate oil cleansers that leave
that residue on your face and all three
of these are definitely that this one
looks like it's been pretty used and it
has slowly because I've been using it to
take off arm swatches a foundation just
so it doesn't totally go to waste
but that's probably what I'll use all
these for this one smells really good I
actually have a oil cleanser that I
really like lately that I found a couple
weeks ago I didn't want to mention it in
this video since it's fairly new it'll
probably be a next month's video if I
continue to like it okay this concealer
this is the essence full coverage
camouflage concealer definitely not full
coverage I did not like how this looked
on my skin the wand everything about
this I just do not like would not
recommend I think they're much better
drugstore concealers out there I need to
get it wiped going up in here I'm just
gonna quickly touch on this one because
I feel like it's like beating a dead
horse at this point but this is the
Anastasio subculture palette I have a
whole video using this my thoughts are
pretty much exactly the same as it was
in that video I think you can make it
work there just definitely not the best
formula I've ever tried they're very
powdery and I just don't think it's
worth your money so this is the Urban
Decay urban defense complexion primer I
can't remember if I use this in a first
impression or if I just tried this out
but it is so freaking oily feeling I may
if you have dry skin this might be nice
but for my skin this is a definite no it
also smells really chemically which I
don't like this you guys saw in the
testing Amazon makeup video this is the
Saachi intense matte lip velvet what was
this this was like 18 bucks or 19 bucks
not cheap and this was just so friggin
patchy and drying the wand on hair feels
hella cheap I had to do like two or
three coats of this just to make my
lipstick look opaque really not into
this liquid lipstick formula especially
for that price point alright so this
last product I tried out in a first
impressions video so you guys saw me
trying to use this this is the pixi by
petra quick fix powder it has a green
tint to it which is so bizarre it looks
a little bit green on your face and the
packaging of this the whole concept of
this I just I'm not there I don't get it
it's so messy what's supposed to happen
is you take this off and then the powder
is supposed to come out through this
puff and it just doesn't come out like
the amount of powder you would need to
get like a smooth and even application
just doesn't come out it's a definite
miss on the packaging but then the
actual product as well if you just go in
and try and use it in the bottom here
with like a brush or a sponge wasn't the
most smoothing powder and it does have
this weird green blue tint to it right
so those were all of my raves and
rejects for the past couple months I'm
gonna have everything listed down below
let me know what your favorite products
were also let me know if you've tried
any of the products I mentioned what you
think of them I'm always curious and I
need to go eat and stop filming because
I've literally been filming for six
hours now if you guys enjoyed this video
