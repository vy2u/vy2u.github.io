talking about September raves and
rejects I feel like I've been all over
the place with testing products this
month because I've been in a
pre-recording so much pretty much like
three or four out of the seven days of
the week I'm doing either some kind of
first impression Shadow Man schmooze
some kind of video so I've been
switching up all the products a lot so
the products I'm mentioning today are
really the ones that really stand out
that I continuously reach for and I
recommend to guys you guys know that I
don't take these videos lightly if I'm
going to recommend something at
something that I've really tried out I
don't want you spending your money on
 products and I don't want to spend
my money on products really quickly
want to say that right now when you guys
are watching this I'm in New York so I'm
going to put all my socials right here
you can follow along
I always snap I pretty much like snap
vlog so if you liked the last vlog I
posted follow me on snapchat because
they're my vlogs are pretty much just
extended versions of snapchat last thing
before we get into the products the look
I'm wearing right now I did do a whole
video on its drugstore and cruelty free
it'll be up after this video on
Wednesday so my products this month are
a little bit all over the place we have
some skin care hair stuff makeup let's
jump into it so I want to start off with
foundation and this is a product that I
almost can wear by itself it definitely
is dark on its own by itself so I do mix
it in with something but I love how it
looks on its own and mixed in with
products this is the covergirl clean
matte BB cream in the shade 510 this has
awesome coverage I almost wouldn't call
this a BB cream I don't know if there's
some kind of skincare benefit in here I
don't think there is I'm not really sure
why this was marketed as a BB cream
there might be but anyways I did a full
foundation Friday review on this product
and ever since then whenever I'm not
sure what I want to put on my face or I
need something to mix in with the
foundation it has always been this
product the way I mix it is I just put
in a dab of the Josie Maran vibrancy
argan oil foundation also have a review
on this and I just want to restate
really quickly that if you're ever
wondering if I've done a review on a
product or if I've used a product in a
shadow in shmooze you want to hear my
thoughts on it all you have to do is
search on youtube the Tayla and the name
the product even if it's not in the
title of the video if a video comes up
it means that I have listed it in the
description box which means that I used
it in the video likely so if you're ever
wondering if I've done a review on a
foundation or whatever just search it
it'll come up if I have but anyways
that's like one of my biggest pet peeves
so I feel like I have to tell you guys
that onto these two so I like to mix
these two because this one is definitely
more matte but it's not like super matte
I tend to like more satin matte
foundations and I would say that's what
this is this is full-on Dewey Dewey I
actually like this on its own as well I
really like this foundation it's
beautiful foundation in my opinion but
these two mixed together there's
something about it they just look
stunning lasts all day because this BB
cream is actually very long-lasting if
you ask me what the best medium to full
coverage foundation is if you like a
matte finish I would say this you can
build it up to full coverage off of one
layer I get like a high medium coverage
these two together are kind of like my
go-to combo this month then a more
recent product that I've totally fallen
in love with is the Tarte shaped ape
concealer this is in the shade fair
I think they released more shades but I
have the shade fair it works really well
for me and I've been really into spot
concealing this one so basically before
I put on my foundation I will put on
spot concealer to cover up some of my
acne and redness and I just feel like I
have to use way less foundation I don't
know why I haven't been doing this for
years but it's been working amazing I
love this for spot concealing because
you need literally the tiniest amount it
goes super far under the eyes though
this is unreal this is the first
concealer I found that I do not have to
set with the powder actually like it
better not set with the powder because
it sets on its own and you don't have to
put a powder on top it looks flawless
the entire day like I don't get creasing
under my eyes which I pretty much do
with any concealer you get twice the
amount and product in here as typical
concealers so for the price I think it's
worth it and I've just been totally
wowed by this concealer I think it's
totally worth the hype you should
my desk right now literally not an inch
of space I'm just piling on top of
it got a lot of questions about my skin
lately a lot of you guys have been
wondering if I switched up any products
because it looks clear to you and this
is what my skin does like I'll be
totally clear for a week or two - is
like pushin it usually a week I'll be
totally clear not a single is it pretty
much like how I am right now and then
it'll totally freak out and it'll like
purge and I'll have these huge cystic
acne on my chin and on my neck just keep
that in mind when I'm talking about my
skin but anyways my skin has been doing
better overall I would say and I think
it is a hundred percent due to this
product this is the Olay Henriksen
invigorating night treatment so this is
an aaj overnight resurfacer so basically
after I wash tone yeah pretty much it
washing tone my face I go in with this
stuff you need the tiniest amount is
like a gel formula I put this all over
my face and down my neck little bit and
then I let it dry for about 15 to 20
minutes and then I'll put a moisturizer
on top sometimes I don't even put a
moisturizer on top honestly this is very
pricey but for me it's been working so
for me I would repurchase it my skin
loves this the only other thing I've
changed in regards to my skincare
skincare is the jouer anti blemish matte
primer this has salicylic acid in it
which is why I think my skin really
likes it but ever since I switched
primers my skin has been doing a lot
better
primer I know is one of those things
that breaks me out I don't know if it's
the silicone in certain primers but this
is a silicone free paraben free
hypoallergenic oil free primer with
salicylic acid I like this because I
don't use a moisturizer before my
foundation anymore I kind of use this as
like a two-in-one this is my moisturizer
and primer it has kind of like a lotion
you feel to it but then it totally dries
down like a gel which I like because I
feel like my foundation sticks on to it
really well it doesn't have any kind of
poor blurring properties so obviously
since its silicone free it doesn't
really like smooth out a whole lot this
is mostly just to prep the skin and I
feel like it helps with the longevity of
my foundation a little bit it's always
hard to tell alright this highlight has
been what I've been reaching for the
past couple weeks almost everyday
this is the goddess of love triple baked
highlighter and I use this in the
drugstore first impressions video I'll
link it right here
this is stunning this is one of those
highlighters that makes you look like
what kind of glow it's not glittery it's
not super shimmery where you're going to
like see the texture it just almost has
like a wet effect it looks so good on
the nose I'm not wearing it right now
because I just film the other video but
this also is cruelty free by the way
this is like under 7 bucks if you've
been watching any of my videos from this
past month you know that I've been on
the hunt for contour products I can't
tell you how many freaking contour
palettes are sitting on this desk right
now in my drawer I literally think I
purchased 30 different contour products
based on your recommendations and just
research that I did two of them right
now are really sticking out to me I
haven't given some of the other ones a
total chance yet so I'm still playing
around with those before I make that
video one is by elf and it is actually
an eyebrow kit that I've been using to
contour my face when I snapped about
contour products a few of you guys told
me to try out this this is the elf
eyebrow kit in the shade light this
shade as a contour if you have pale skin
is perfection
this is one of the lightest cool tone
products I found this is like very
natural but you can also kind of build
it up the only downside to this is that
because it's an eyebrow product the pan
is super tiny if you just want the most
natural-looking contour product if
you're pale princess this is the way to
go it's three bucks you can't go wrong
product that is a little bit darker more
in line with NYX taupe blush is the
morphe contour palette this is the 9c
pellet this shade right here is
perfection I actually think the formula
of these are beautiful they're very soft
and buttery they blend out really easily
but I don't blend away on your face this
shade is very similar to next taupe I
just think they nailed it with the
formula of these I've been reaching for
this one a lot I don't know why but all
of a sudden I've done a lot of questions
from you guys about brushes so I've been
trying to be better about talking about
which specific brush I'm using in each
video but three brushes have been stand
out to me this month
first is by wet and wild and it's this I
don't know what the actual name of this
is but I use it to contour slash bronze
whatever it just is
so soft it blends out product
beautifully I got the Kabuki brush from
this line to also try for a few dollars
from the drugstore this brush is awesome
to others that I've been using a ton
this month are the morphe g 38 and the
morphe m 5 11 the g 38 is the only thing
I've been using for concealer lately
this is the first brush I found that I
really like for under-eye concealer as
opposed to just using my finger I love
this it blends out under eye concealer
perfectly I also use this a spot conceal
when I put on my Tarte shape tape
concealer I just go in with this and
blend it out before I put on my
foundation love this brush the m5 11
kind of surprised me because when I
first use this it's not the softest
brush in the world it has this precious
is like goat hair but the thing that
rocks about this brush is that it
actually comes to a point at the top I
don't know if you'll be able to see that
but it's not just a blending brush
because of this point it just perfectly
gets in your crease while also blending
I love this I've been using this every
single day so this one is a more recent
fun but I feel like with setting sprays
especially a dewy one you either like it
or you don't
I'm obsessed with this this is the hard
candy sheer envy hydrating primer miss
12-hour power I actually don't use this
as a primer I haven't tried it as a
primer yet I should probably do that
I've only been setting my face with this
initially set my face with it because I
didn't even read it was a primer I just
wrote hydrating and I was like yes give
me the do once I use it as a setting
spray I was hooked because you guys this
gives you the best do out of any setting
spray I've tried more than the pixie
glow mist this is like major do if you
use it over your foundation oil free
silicone free alcohol-free hard candy
primers have been grown on me I love the
black one I love this one super
affordable and this is literally 50
times better than the tatcha luminous
skin mist way better a few more products
and then we're going on to the rejects
so this one I wanted to mention because
this is super unique to me I just never
really heard anyone talk about this this
is the bite Beauty lip what is matte wow
this is like the tiniest one I've ever
seen in my life matte cream lip crayon
in the shade Blanc so this is basically
a white lip product and the cool thing
about this is that you can
use it underneath lipstick if you want
it to really bring out the full color at
the lipstick and pigment or you can do
what I do and put it on top of a nude
and kind of blend it out if you want to
address the shade of lipstick think of
just like mixing paint or mixing
foundations if you put a little bit of
white on top it'll help lighten it out
you can just get the exact color you
want if you want to make a nude lipstick
super nude this is awesome
it's just really cool because you can
basically customize any lip shade that
you have so I love the formula this I've
been trying out different white lip
products in the formula this one I think
is the best by far very creamy
moisturizing but not where it feels like
it's sliding around your lips at all
alright so on to the last two products
which are both hair products so if
you've been following my hair journey at
all I basically went from 10 years of
box black dyed to finally a gray shade
which has taken me four months to get to
and multiple multiple is in six
bleaching sessions moral of the story
basically for the last four months I
went from extremely over processed
damaged hair to semi healthy which was a
combination of cutting off the damage
and just products and treatments for my
hair before this last session of
bleaching my hair felt good like my hair
felt normal within a month when I
started using these two products my hair
and that's when I noticed the biggest
difference so if you're someone who
either has dry hair or just a very
damaged hair highly recommend these two
mattes both of them are from the
drugstore the first is the Garnier
damage eraser it says strength
reconstruction abut err both of these I
use actually as conditioner I don't use
conditioner anymore these are what I've
been using as my conditioner this is the
L'Oreal total repair 5 damage erasing
balm I leave them on for about 5 to 10
minutes you could also put this on as a
hair mask and either sleep in it
overnight or just put it on a hair cap
or whatever
well my left leg is totally asleep not
much I can say about these besides they
work if I had to choose one I think I
would go with the Garnier one I can't
even tell you how many hair products
I've tried in the last 4 months and
these in combination with some of the
other products I've used have just
totally changed my hair the next rave is
actually a hair tool I've been getting
so many questions lately about how I
curl my hair
is the easiest thing ever because all I
do is use this wand this is by Bombay
and it's there five and one one so it
comes with five different tops Bombay
Hot Tools I've used for years highly
recommend these they're flat iron is
amazing this is amazing in the 5 in 1
set this is the biggest top that it
comes with but you basically just like
unlock this and you can just take this
thing off there you go I have a discount
code for you guys so I'll put that down
below but I show you exactly how I do my
hair in that vlog that I posted last
week using this guy all right on to
rejects when I think about the biggest
disappointment this month it was
definitely the Anastasia Beverly Hills
stick foundation oh god yeah I really
don't like this I don't know it really
did not work for me I'm not going to go
too much in depth about this since I did
a full review on it but pretty much my
thoughts since that first impression
review have not changed a whole lot I
tried it with different primers with the
powder without a powder with different
setting sprays to me like the most basic
thing that you can do right with a stick
foundation is make it very blendable so
when you put it on your face you can
blend it out easily and this is like
freaking trying to blend out glue on
your face I really don't understand the
full coverage claim I have to apply way
more of this product from the makeup
farmer stick foundation to get full
coverage this stick foundation is very
similar to the hourglass vanish stick
foundation to me in the sense that
people either love it or hate it and I'm
one of those people who happen to hate
both of those products that's like the
most strong reject of the month that's
when I feel most strongly about these
other two aren't horrible they're just
not my cup of tea this is the BH Studio
Pro gel liner I've been trying to find
good black gel liners that don't
transfer the thing that got me onto this
whole gel liner kick was the Inglot gel
liner I love that one except that it
massively transfers no matter what I do
so since then I've been on the hunt to
find one that's as black this one just
doesn't have the pigment there it
doesn't stay on well wouldn't recommend
this is the essence dip liner in
waterproof I think I picked this up
because I was hearing good things from
you guys about one of the essence liners
I don't think it was this one I
realized after I got it first of all the
cap is freakin hard to get out of here
the felt-tip I'm not a fan of it's weird
it almost gets thicker towards the end
it's really hard to make wing it almost
cracks on me that's what really turned
me off from this is that when you put it
on and if you try and like go back to
cover up a spot it'll just start
cracking so not into this one alright so
that was everything I feel like I didn't
have a whole lot of products this month
but the ones that I mentioned I am
totally into if you guys like this video
and you want razÃ³n rejects to continue
make sure you give it a thumbs up also
