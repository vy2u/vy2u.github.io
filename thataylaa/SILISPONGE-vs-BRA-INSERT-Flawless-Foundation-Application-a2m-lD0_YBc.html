putting to the test the sponge that
broke the internet this thing this is
the silly sponge by Holly Cosmetics if
you've been living in an Internet bubble
thing blew up on Instagram it's not an
article on yahoo beauty comparing the
silly sponge to a bra insert so I got
some bronzers I'm going to do a half
space comparison the silly sponge on one
side versus a bra insert I got a little
crane user actually push-up things I
don't know we'll make it work maybe
it'll cup and face nicely the silly
sponge has been majorly sold out it's
restocked like five times we're doing
pre-order now I actually got it on the
first round before this thing blew up
one of you guys talking on Instagram and
I ordered it that second but now this is
completely sold out so if you've been
wanting to try something like this maybe
the bronzer will be a dupe we'll find
out the silly sponge retails for $12
that's on sale for $9.99 certs anywhere
from five to ten bucks on Amazon I know
Charlotte Russe heads in for like five
bucks forever 21 probably has them and
you can find bronzers that are just this
size if you're going to try just make
sure that has the silicone feel to it so
it'll glide over your face hopefully
this is actually not made of silicone on
their website that has made a PU which
is polyurethane which is basically a
material that's used in a bunch of
different stuff synthetic fibers like
spandex condoms hoses so I think I'm
excited silly sponge on this side of my
face and then the broad insert on this
side of my face obviously there's a huge
size difference in this I kind of wish
there was a little thumb spot here a
finger spot you could just kind of see
not to hold it you could just stick your
finger in and go so I'm excited so I'm
going to be using the Urban Decay Naked
Skin Foundation because I know how this
one performs I love this foundation the
whole foundation review on this product
I'll link it down below along with my
foundation playlist the whole idea with
this is that you're supposed to be able
to use less products because it's not
going to soak anything up like a Beauty
Blender or a brush it honestly amazes me
that it's 2016 and this is the first
time someone's thinking of something
like this just when you said it's all
the judge so I'm just going to dab I
don't want everything
stand right now normative I usually use
quite a bit of product but see how far
this goes so let's start with that and
I'm going to use the silly sponge to I'm
excited
okay let's whoa whoa okay this feels
like hella soft so when I put on
foundation I typically stipple it on to
get the most coverage it's a little bit
tricky to get right in the crevice of
your nose just because the shape of this
maybe that's just my nose who knows
coverage aside for a second as far as
just how it applies on how the product
actually looks on my skin right now
it looks really really smooth that being
said by smearing it you don't get a ton
of coverage at all I definitely get
better coverage with a sponge or brush
by tapping but we're going to go in with
a little bit more I'm just going to put
it right on the sponge those rubbing it
around I'm going to try and kind of
stipple it on and see what happens
so got better coverage with that method
for sure stippling it on I wish you guys
up close once I do this side but there's
something not really going into my skin
it feels like it's just kind of sitting
on top of it and my pores look super
emphasised right now let's try and just
disel on the side of my forehead
okay the sound is really simplifying you
still kind of have to rub it just so
it's smooth the finish of it does look
really natural it does look like it has
less texture than a brush to me i'ma see
if I can go in with it hang a bit more
just to get the kind of coverage I
normally do I this foundation I can
usually get full coverage with
especially on two layers if I stipple so
I want to see if I can do that with this
yeah I don't know why but it's literally
just sitting on top of mind force right
now okay so still not as much coverage
as I get with a sponge or a brush at all
let's try the other side in between so I
think I'm going to first use this kind
of triangle side this is a finished side
okay Kimball's I'm putting a broad pad
on my face right now the things you do
for YouTube this one actually feels a
lot softer I'm going to see how these
blend out with concealer too because why
not that looks super natural on the skin
I actually feel like this one an
outhouse
because it's bigger or what but this one
just blended out a little bit easier
still very light coverage this is
obviously going to be harder to the
forehead because look how giant this
thing is but we're going to do our best
attempts not to get the souls in my room
the cool thing is that I do think this
makes you have to use less product for
sure the bad thing is that with both of
these if you're someone who needs
coverage is not going to do it the same
as a brush or a sponge would even let's
try to stipple this one I've gotta say
this one cuts your face pretty nice I
think we're getting about the same kind
of coverage on both sides and I really
think the only noticeable difference
between these two is the size coverage
finish everything else look pretty much
identical so let's go in with concealer
and try to blend this guy how is this
heart-shaped tape concealer let's do
this
this has a tiny bit of an angle period
at the top okay this is a little tricky
especially to get right in there other
than that it actually is really smooth
around here but I'm going to have to use
my finger to get in here let's attempt
this side cool this is hard and yeah
this is just way too big so two-handed
job yeah this one is way too big so I'm
gonna go back on Sicilies bunch of manga
shops the board still a fun to make
anyone else think of like a two-year-old
boy
so concealer not the easiest to apply
just because of the shape it does blend
it out fine but I think you would need a
smaller shape to really be able to blend
it out successfully I'm going to get up
close and show you guys the coverage we
got so with two layers I got about low
medium coverage you can still see acne
freckles a lot of stuff coming through
and on two layers of this foundation I
usually get full coverage I'm actually
going to go on at the brush and stipple
just so you can see what kind of
coverage I normally get with this keep
in mind I'm obviously going on top of a
couple layers but I can get really
amazing coverage with this foundation by
stifling definitely prefer a brush on
the forehead series decide with a brush
here's without have way better coverage
going on right now
all right so the rest I make design I'm
going to give you my final thought first
I want to see how easy it is to clean
these or wipe them down I'm not going to
do like a deep clean if you wanted to do
it like a deep clean you probably just
use rubbing alcohol and a cotton pad I
was going to use a baby wipe right here
and see if this comes up because also
you use a makeup wipe wait oh this is
totally rubbing off super easily so
that's another advantage of this over
the Beauty Blender or brush is that you
can just clean it really easily
definitely more sanitary unless you deep
clean your brushes every single day
let's be real who does that
yes totally clean same with this one
comes off really easily final size as
far as application these two are pretty
much the exact same thing besides the
size that's really the only difference I
can see for me unless I want super super
light coverage which I usually don't
because they have a lot to cover up it
probably won't be reaching with this
again it's definitely going to shoot out
your foundations it's almost like when
you blend like this with the brush
versus stipple so if you want the most
coverage of your foundation I don't
think it's going to get that few if you
don't need a whole lot of coverage I
think this applies totally fine I don't
totally love how it applies around the
corners of your face like your nose and
eyes and stuff alright I think that's
all I can talk about two pieces of
silicon if you guys like this video make
sure you give this a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the BAE Rio family
and subscribe I upload pretty much three
times a week Monday Wednesday Fridays
