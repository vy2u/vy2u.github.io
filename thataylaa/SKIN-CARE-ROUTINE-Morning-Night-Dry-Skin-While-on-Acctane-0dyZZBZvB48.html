off Amazon
all right so today I'm finally gonna be
sharing with you guys what I've been
using on my skin since starting accutane
so today is actually exactly three
months on accutane when I'm filming this
I did my blood work this morning I think
I still have the thing on yep
forgot about that until this moment
since starting accutane this has
probably been my most requested video to
make and I wanted to wait a few months
to make this video just so I could
thoroughly try everything out see what
works for me to see what doesn't work
for me there's definitely been products
that I have eliminated that my skin did
not like so I feel like the ones I'm
using right now are pretty solid this
routine has been working really well for
me I don't have a three-month update for
you guys I'm gonna be doing a four-month
update because my three-month labwork
results are coming back the same day I'm
leaving out of the country and as far as
everything else it's been exactly the
same as my two month update so I'm gonna
like that down below if you want to know
more about accutane and I go really in
depth about everything there so link
that video down below but here's my face
at the 3-month point for those of you
following along I have a couple down
here I'm still getting some breakouts
and stuff but I mean 50 billion times
clearer than when I started and I'll
leave the acne story video down below to
if you're just stumbling across this
video so this is a routine of some of
these products are really just for dry
skin folks those of you out there so
basically I've been using a lot of these
products since day one of starting just
to kind of hopefully prevent some of the
dryness and I think it has really helped
I haven't seen the major major like
severe dryness that a lot of people talk
about some people say it comes out the
4-month point so will see my lips have
been the driest of anything but as far
as my skin I think the products I've
been using have really been helping so
I'm excited to share them with you guys
hopefully if you have really dry skin or
normal to dry skin somebody's products
will work really well for you too so I'm
gonna talk you guys through everything I
do in the morning and a night as far as
skin care I'm talking for like 5000
hours right now and probably none of
this is necessary let's get into the
products so if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up while you're watching if you're new
here you can join the baby doe family
and subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time
keep in mind if you are in accutane
anything you put on your skin you want
it to be a really basic really gentle
typically look fragrance for you really
basic
staff no retinols no glycolic acid or
anything like that just really basic so
I think I'm gonna start out with
nighttime it's night time it's been a
good day I'm taking off my makeup best
part of the night the products I've been
using to remove my makeup have been oils
I haven't really enjoyed using my usual
Neutrogena wipes just because it's just
more tugging at your skin and everything
and if your skin is feeling kind of
sensitive and dry oils are just much
more pleasant to put on your face and
these to get the job done so this is the
fresh Seabury cleansing oil and then
also the polished choice perfect
cleansing oil I really like both of
these don't burn my eyes they take up
all of my waterproof eye makeup all of
my foundation and everything and they
just give your skin this really glowy
tight kind of look without being
uncomfortably tight you know how some of
those oils leave your skin like super
tight but there's no residue that's the
one thing I hate with oils I know you
use a cleanser after just personally I
hate the feeling of having that oil
residue left over they just feel like
really light cleansing oils and they're
great so the cleanser I've been using
morning and nighttime this thing is like
the love of my life I highly recommend
this for any skin type even if you have
oily skin I wish I knew about this when
I had oil II skin because it's just a
great cleanser this is a survey
hydrating facial cleanser has ceramides
and hyaluronic acid in it you can get
survey from the drugstore survey if
you're on accutane and Cetaphil but as
far as like things I've read and
research I've done survey has a little
bit better ingredients but those are
kind of two safe drugstore brands if
you're on accutane they're very gentle
most dermatologists will recommend one
of the two this is the only cleanser you
need has this really nice almost milky
soft kind of consistency that was hard
to get out consistency to it said that
ten times it does leave your skin
feeling a bit more moisturized without
leaving a kind of film on your skin get
this so after I go in with that cleanser
morning and I also go in with this toner
by Mario Badescu this is the aloe vera
toner this I like I just find this very
basic I don't really think it majorly
you know moisturizes or hydrates my skin
or anything but just for a basic gentle
toner I do like this one also a lot of
these recommendations I got from either
Gotham ista or Stefanie Nicole I've
mentioned both of them before they're
great and how
shit-ton more knowledge than I do about
skincare so if you want to know more
about ingredients and everything they go
really in depth about that on their
channels but Stephanie recommended the
Shiseido facial cotton I don't know how
I haven't been using these my entire
life because there's literally no point
to waste money on the shitty drugstore
ones that like peel apart all the time
on you because these are so nice these
are very large pad so if you cut them in
half you'll get double the use out of
them obviously and what do you do that
they're around the same price as the
ones you can get at the drugstore so you
get these on Sephora they're great they
don't shed these are great for using
with toner with and usually I actually
don't have very much makeup if any
leftover if you're using the oil
cleansers and then the hydrating
cleanser I really like using a toner
just so I can make sure that
everything's off and I can see if I
missed in the areas or whatever kind of
everything up until that point is the
same morning at night this is where it
kind of goes to different directions so
we're gonna start with nighttime I am
all about face masks there's something
that's so relaxing and just satisfying
about putting on a good face mask and I
actually in the past have hated sheep
mask and I finally found one that is
amazing I love this one this is by Misha
it's a pure source sell sheet shea
butter mask I love this because when I
take it off when I take off the sheet
mask it actually has totally absorbed
him to my skin and my skin looks and
feels visibly more moisturize I feel
like this one actually does something
I've been staying completely away from
any of the detoxifying or clay masks
anything that I used to use and I had
acne oily skin I've been only using
Shamus or masks that are hydrating or
like a gel mask so some nights I'll use
a sheet mask if I feel like I need a
little more extra moisture just want to
keep my skincare routine as basic as
possible use minimal but effective
products that are actually gonna do
something so if I'm not using a sheet
mask or if I am a bone with a
moisturizer I haven't been using a serum
I've been using some oils but I'll talk
about that after but usually I'll just
go directly in with a moisturizer so I
have one very pricey one high-end and
then I also have a drugstore one want to
mention both of them because I do really
enjoy both of these let me tell you what
they are first so this is the Murad
hydrodynamic ultimate moisture cream I
think this thing is like 75 bucks like
this is for again pricey this is
definitely more of a splurge moisturizer
this is the survey skin renewing night
cream I've had this for I want to say a
month and a half now and I'm almost out
of this this is amazing again from the
drugstore survey this one is definitely
a thick nighttime kind of cream we don't
want to be putting this on in the
morning probably before your makeup I
like to something a little bit lighter
but if you're someone who likes that
really thick heavy feeling moisturizer
which I actually do at night I really
like that rather than like a really
lightweight gel kind of one this since I
started using it I feel like has done
wonders for my skin my skin has been
flake free since I started using this
stuff it is great I think it's around 15
bucks you can usually get survey
products either buy one get one half off
or buy one get one free at drugstores so
obviously quite a bit more affordable
than the Murad one this one is
interesting because it's super
moisturizing but it's very lightweight
so if you're someone who doesn't like
the thick creams like this you might
like this one better there's something
about this that leaves your skin feeling
is so baby soft this one you could
definitely use underneath makeup as well
you could use this one morning and night
this one has hyaluronic acid in it I
believe this Herve one does too by the
way I've been traveling so much and on
different planes and everything and this
throughout all of the traveling has
still cut to my skin not super dry this
is all I brought with me over the
holidays for my nighttime moisturizer I
didn't bring any oils or anything and it
was working great so it's kind of like
an oil before moisturizer or after
moisturizer debate from the things that
I've read it seems like after is the way
to go because oil can penetrate
moisturizer but not vice versa correct
me if I'm wrong but as far as I know
you're actually supposed to put on oils
as your last step so oils are something
for me that's been really hard to find
something that doesn't break me out and
that doesn't totally freak out my skin I
think I talked about this in the two
month update video bye tried out a hobo
oil totally cause my skin to get like
the coma Dawn's and also weird roughness
like super super rough as I've been
trying out all this stuff by the way
I've been trying to add in one product
at a time just so I know what's doing
what I ended up cutting that out it was
the ho Boyle that was causing that and
then I tried the fresh sea berry
moisturizing facial oil have this one on
right now swear I'm getting the glow
from right now I don't think I would
recommend this yet because I don't feel
like it's made a huge difference in my
skin I've used this for a few weeks at a
time then I'll stop using it for a
couple weeks and I really don't notice a
big difference yet with this maybe it's
something that you need to use for a
longer period of time to really notice
the difference I almost get like a weird
issue with this one when I have it on
I'm gonna keep using it and see if I
like it more as I continue to use it but
I wanted to mention X is in my routine
currently the other oil I'm trying that
a ton of you guys recommended is the
ordinary rosehip oil this is like what
five or eight bucks I think a Sephora
actually carries the ordinary now which
rocks the ordinary basically has bomb
skincare ingredients first super
affordable prices the Rose Avoyelles
supposed to be really great for acne and
scarring and everything so I've been
starting to use this one I've only been
using this for about a week and a half
maybe so I haven't been using this long
enough to see any kind of difference so
far I don't think it's broken me out
which is good so that's a good sign I'm
gonna keep using this one so that's what
I do at nighttime as far as my face I
guess is still in my face but then I'll
go in with an eye serum so I've been
using one of three this is one I used in
the morning the autocorrect by Sunday
Riley it has a really nice brightening
effect to it it's really nice for deep
puffing and giving the look of brighter
under eyes I like using this even if I'm
not wearing any makeup that day because
it just makes you look awake then the
two I've been switching between at night
are the survey eye Repair Cream high end
total splurge is a drunk elephant Shaba
complex eye serum don't really know
which one I like better yet this one is
definitely more pleasant to apply has
this really nice twist bottle and it
really absorbs into your skin it really
is like a serum less of a cream this one
basically just feels like an eye cream
nothing super thick and the thing super
thin apparently there are good
ingredients in here that actually do
something so they say we will see a time
will tell that was a lot of quotes right
there so the only thing I do different
in the morning is the moisturizer and
then I'll incorporate an SPF so for
morning moisturizer I'll use the survey
daily moisturizing lotion
this also has hyaluronic acid in it this
feels a much more lightweight than this
one in the jar this one is just very
basic it's the job done keeps my skin
moisturize it's not scented or anything
and it doesn't break me out so this has
been working really well underneath
makeup and everything while still
keeping me moisturized and then for an
SPF I've been using the
MD SPF 45 my dermatologist recommends
this you can get this off of Amazon they
make one with tint in it I don't want to
get that because the tent is usually way
too dark but someone is very white but I
almost like it because it cancels out
some of the redness on my face because
my face is way darker and redder than my
neck right now so this kind of helps to
make it a little bit more even so I'll
use that last after the daily
moisturizer or all do one at the other
because this one is actually pretty
moisturizing on its own and if you saw
my dry skin foundation routine I go more
in depth about the products I used to
prep my skin before makeup so I'll link
that video in the eye over here and down
below one thing that I use kind of
wherever whenever I feel like is the
pixi hydrating milky miss says
hyaluronic acid in it and black oat and
this I really just like for literally
whenever if I have makeup on if I don't
have makeup on underneath makeup this
one just has a lot of different uses for
it and a spritzer on this bottle is an
experience on its own it's pretty great
a spritzer that is not so great is the
rose water and glycerin heritage store
you can get this off of Amazon the only
reason why I don't reach for this one a
whole lot over this is because of the
spritz are on here it's horrible it goes
everywhere it like gets in your hair so
I need to get a different top for this
this one is great if you just want
something with a little bit more basic
ingredients you can go underneath your
makeup over your makeup to set it kind
of the same uses as this one this is
really affordable I think it's like 10
bucks on Amazon you get ton of products
you get eight fluid ounces in here the
vo dry skin you probably have dry lips
too if you're on accutane you definitely
have dry lips my holy grail like if you
were gonna buy one thing out of the
three lip products I'm going to talk
about that's actually gonna do something
get the aquaphor healing ointment this
is not the lip products they also have
one in a tube that one is not nearly as
good as this this is the healing
ointment it really does help keeps your
lips coated I use this probably
literally at least 20 times throughout
the day I'll use this at night I use it
in the morning
anytime I don't have anything on my lips
all usually going with that if I want to
switch it up or if I want something a
little bit more thick and like tacky for
the night time for sleeping in the bite
agave lip mask I do really like I didn't
like this when I first started using it
before accutane I've actually been using
it
probably four months now I want to say
once my lips start getting drier I do
feel like this helps this one I don't
like how it feels on my lips you can't
really do anything in this this is
really for putting on right before you
go to sleep because it is very sticky I
don't know why they made this packaging
for this product it really should just
be a squeeze like a lip applicator
because the cap gets all sticky and
everything I've talked about this a time
but this is the lineage lip sleeping
mask this one I like using basically
instead of a lip gloss or lip product
where I want some kind of color to my
lips it has this really beautiful light
pink color love using this on minimal
makeup days it'll keep some moisture in
there it doesn't do as much as the
aquaphor for me as far as dryness but it
just looks really nice over dry lips and
it gives you a little bit of color and
plumpness and it's just great I'm almost
out of this thing I talk about
everything I have sitting here I think I
did so that's everything that I've been
doing morning and night to things that
I'm going to slowly be trying to
incorporate it in and try out I want to
show you guys I can do kind of follow up
and talk about him later as the sole
suta Kohl's day glow serum this has 20%
vitamin C freulich acid hyaluronic acid
and D alpha to know what that is
anti-aging formula so this got amazing
reviews on Amazon vitamin C again is
good for fading scarring and anti-aging
all that though so use this in the
morning after cleansing and toning and
everything but before your moisturizer
if you're in accutane your skin is
already super sensitive to the Sun so
just be aware if you do try this out use
it with an SPF for sure because vitamin
C already makes your skin more sensitive
something else I've been trying out that
I've heard amazing things about by I
think the Misa talks a lot about this
but also on Amazon people swear by this
product on Amazon this is the how to
lobo kokujin i think that's how you say
it lotion it's not a lotion this is a
Japanese product and I think lotions in
Japanese skincare more won't be the word
for it it they're basically like a water
kind of product it has a little bit more
viscosity it's not like a total liquid
formula it feels almost like a serum I
guess serum is what you'd call it it
says after cleansing pore pea-sized
amount to your palm and run between
hands to heat
Pat it into your face until absorbed and
people swear by this for just adding
hydration and giving you this really
plump kind of look I want to keep using
this one you can also do like a DIY
sheet mask with this which is really
cool is there two other things that I'm
trying out but these everything else I
mentioned are the ones that just have
been working amazing for my skin I'm
hoping that the dryness and everything
just stays this amount throughout the
rest of the three months because this is
totally way way better than I was
anticipating I thought my skin was gonna
be like flaking off my face and I think
it would be again without these products
so that's I if there's anything that you
guys think I should be trying out let me
know down below any products or tips or
whatever let me know if you want to see
the six month video of kind of my top
tops from the six month on accutane what
I would recommend I can't even put
accutane the title this video because it
will get deep monetize from YouTube
Thank You YouTube lettin creators just
do their job so for months accutane
update will be coming once I have the
three month and four month lab results
back don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
subscribe if you want to stick around I
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
