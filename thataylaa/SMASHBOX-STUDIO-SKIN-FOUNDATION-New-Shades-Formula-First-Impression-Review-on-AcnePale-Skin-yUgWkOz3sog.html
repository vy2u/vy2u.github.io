my favorite day of the week if you
missed last week's foundation Friday
video I'm a link that down below I'm
also going to be putting all these
videos in a playlist so you can just
click the playlist and see all the
foundation Friday videos I asked you
guys to vote on Instagram which in
hindsight was a bad decision on my part
because I can't actually see which one
one there's like hundreds of comments so
I think Smashbox one I'm definitely
going to be doing the covergirl clean
matte BB cream next week so if you voted
on that and it didn't win clearly don't
worry this is coming next week I know
I've been doing a lot of high-end
foundations can I get some drugstore
once in the mix for sure I'm also going
to an event today so I didn't want to
wear it this one because I wasn't sure
how the coverage was going to be and how
it's going to like hold up I just
realized this will be the first video
with my new hair I think I post about on
Instagram you guys have obviously seen
me on snapchat but I just realized this
video is actually going up before the
hair video it's a video explaining all
about the hair and how I bought it to
the next stage on the way to silver that
video will be up next week this is kind
of cool so usually pre-record like
couple weeks in advance but I can
actually tell you guys stuff in the same
week that it's happening thanks
foundation Friday let's put the cap on
that looks nicer it says you can be
flawless for 15 hours set me up so if
you follow me on Twitter you saw about a
month ago I think they tweeted about
Smashbox releasing ten new shades at
their studio Skin Foundation I believe
they also reformulated it I don't have
the old version I've never tried this
foundation at all the lightest shade of
this always looked too dark for me so as
soon as I saw that they released some
new light shades I purchased this I
actually bought this on smash box's
website when it first came out the new
shades were only available in Smashbox
now you can get it on Sephora at the
shade 0.5 which is the lightest one they
make now
alright so swatch time right here is the
Smashbox foundation in the lightest
shade 0.5 as you can see is quite a bit
more orange than the other shades this
is the Urban Decay Naked foundation in
the lightest shade Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless in 110 Kat Von D lock
a tattoo and l42
tart reinforce to the C in the lightest
shade I'm going to read some of the
claims off of the box they actually have
more to say at the box than I do on
Smashbox and for websites so says it's a
hydrating foundation
created in our la photo studio to look
and feel amazing throughout an entire 15
hour shoot so this is this would be good
for obviously camera flash photography
I'm assuming does its medium to full
buildable coverage oil-free controls oil
all day I do have combination skin with
cystic acne so I tend to get oily and my
t-zone throughout the day so we shall
see how this controls oil sweat humidity
and exercise resistant color true and
transfer resistant Demi matte finish
this does come in a glass bottle love in
the matte black top it has 1 fluid ounce
of product in this retails for $42.99 oh
if you want to see how it smash about
studio Skin Foundation applies and wears
throughout the day your night place just
keep watching Cheers
I'm a boring cup today let's pin back
the hairs
I feel 0% awake right now what time is
it 723 in the morning I'm going to this
thing right now
so we're getting up early to film ooh I
like the packaging even though it's
super simple it has this like matte
black top there's the tapping again so
I'm just going to pump some foundation
on the back of my palette it's supposed
to be medium to full coverage so I'm
just gonna play about that much so Musa
brush on one side of my face and then a
sponge on the other this is the makeup
geek brush was this foundation stippling
brush I just ordered it and it feels
super soft so I'm excited and I have
primed my face I used a jouer anti
blemish matte primer so I'm going to go
in with the brush on this side like this
is a pretty small brush
this brush is really nice it she like
it's kind of small I'm try different
brush for my forehead I did use up that
whole amount so I'm going to put a
little bit more on this is the Sigma f80
flat top kabuki I'm just going to go
down my forehead off the bat this
reminds me of something
what is this is my move it does have the
kind of gel like formula to me and it
isn't full coverage right off the bat I
would definitely say this is more on the
medium side if I'm gonna have to do a
second layer with this foundation but it
is supposed to be buildable
this is the Real Techniques sponge I
always link everything down below is one
of my favorite sponges actually this is
my favorite it's affordable it's better
than the beauty blender in my opinion I
feel like it gives the best coverage out
of all the makeup sponges and I think we
got like the same amount of coverage we
might have gotten a tiny bit better
coverage with the brush but barely
noticeable as far as the finish on
either sides both of them look very
similar looks like a satin finish so I'm
gonna go in for a second layer
kind of feeling the sponge butter
actually yeah I think either the brush
or sponge is totally fine but I'm kind
of feeling a sponge
okay so I have two layers on take a look
looks really nice very skin-like even
with two layers though I wouldn't say it
is totally full coverage like you're not
going to get Marc Jacobs remarkable kind
of coverage with this even on my
forehead I can see some of my freckles
which I like it kind of makes it look
more like skin really like the finish of
it beautiful satin finish a little bit
quickie around my nose so cool knocking
off the coffee so I'm going to show you
guys a close-up I turned down the lights
so hopefully you can actually see what
it looks like in real life and still see
some scarring and freckles and stuff
showing through but it does look really
nice and smooth I like the finish of it
forehead looks really nice and I need to
pluck the brow so just ignore that can
you see what I mean right here it's a
little bit around the nose already
starting right there is starting to look
a little bit more matte as it's sitting
on my face and starting to set I feel
like that was the quickest application
ever now that I'm thinking about it yeah
that was super fast so it's 7:33 now I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back okay so it's now 757
let's call it eight o'clock I like how
it looks it feels a little bit heavy you
know that feeling when you're wearing
like Mac's Studio Fix and you just feel
like you're wearing a ton of makeup I
kind of feel like that onif is because
the two layers or the powder I used or
what but even before the powder it just
felt kind of like I could feel it on my
face this is supposed to be good on
camera let's take a selfie I'm going to
turn the flash on so we can see if
there's any kind of bounce back okay
gross picture but this looks really good
on flash now that I have powder and
everything on it is looking super
flawless so let's talk about what I used
really quick now where did the cat Wendy
white concealer I'm so excited about
this Thank You Kat Von D basically you
can mix this in with any of your
concealers I use Maybelline instant age
rewind because this one is too dark for
me and I mix it a tiny bit of this and
it was heavenly this is going to be a
lifesaver I can already tell I kind of
want to just try mixing this in with
foundation to highlight is Catrice glam
fusion eyeshadow in Jon Snow's favorite
this is beautiful as a highlight and
it's like two bucks and on my lips is
Too Faced melted matte lipstick in cool
girl
so since this is supposed to last 15
hours I'm going to wear this as long
as possible today we're getting an early
start so I think we might be able to
make it show you eyes it matches
barely I do think it's a little bit not
dark just a little bit too peachy or
oranjee for my skintone if this was a
tiny bit Pinker I think I would really
like the shade if you're lighter than me
I think 0.5 would be too dark I think I
could still mix in a mixer possibly I
need coffee and you don't cotton toast
we will be all right it's now 3:00
o'clock so the Foundation's been on for
seven hours it looks good it is totally
still on everywhere my only complaint is
that is starting to crease or on my nose
area it looks like I'm for sure wearing
foundation my skin just looks kind of
textured I feel like it doesn't look as
skin like as some of my other
foundations you can see it on my
forehead a little bit I feel like you
can just kind of see it sitting on top
of my skin my pores look pretty big
right now nothing horrible it just
doesn't look very natural to me I know
if it's just with the powder that I used
I might try using this not with the
powder next time so I think it looks
like just at this point I feel like I
have other foundations that feel more
invisible but we'll see how it wears I'm
gonna try and keep this on as late as
possible the event was super fun I
snapped all of it is basically like a
fashion show thing for Neiman Marcus and
I've never been to a fashion show before
so that was really cool I'm gonna get
some work done I'm on my knees right now
so all right so it's now 9:30 p.m. so
the Foundation's been on for about 13
and a half hours almost 14 hours so I
feel like I've given it a good wear test
I'm freakin exhausted right now so I'm
going to take off my makeup and get into
bed for the foundation being on for
almost 14 hours it looks really good I
feel like this is one of the first
foundations in a while that has pretty
much totally controlled my oil
I haven't powdered or touched up at all
throughout the day and around my nose
and my forehead it doesn't look super
oily at all what's that being said I
definitely feel like this is one of
those foundations at least on me the
amount I put on and with a powder you
can see the texture it looks like you're
wearing makeup I just feel like it's not
the most flawless finish like you can
definitely see texture but for 14 hours
like damn this
pretty good you can kind of see it like
cracking a little bit right here and
around the nose area it looks a little
bit cakey you can see right here I think
it dies a tad throughout the day under
this light it doesn't look as bad I was
just in the bathroom lighting and it
definitely looked like it oxidized a
little bit I would say if you have oily
skin or combo skin and you've been
struggling to find a foundation that
actually really stays on your face and
you don't need super full Pepperidge
this one might work really well for you
I think I'll probably like this better
with a couple of coverfx drops mixed in
just to give a little bit more coverage
or marché goes remarkable I do love how
long-lasting this is dry skin I think
this could work just because the way it
went on without a powder did feel very
gel like and kind of moisturizing I want
rice powder powder to see how it holds
up I usually after you guys on snapchat
of those things I'm not totally in love
with this and not in love with how it
feels on my face it feels very heavy so
that's my thoughts on this foundation if
you guys liked this video give it a
thumbs up let me know down below if
you're excited for foundation Friday
next week I'm actually filming next
week's video tomorrow because I'm be
gone for like 10 days so have to
