Pride Parade it is like 85 degrees out
in Seattle right now and I just ate
Cinnabon delights so I'm in a very good
mood feeling chatty feeling good I
figured we would do a Q&amp;amp;A video because
I've been saying we're going to do this
for a while I don't think you've really
done a Q&amp;amp;A video in a long time and I
feel like in the last few months there's
a lot of new people on my channel so
comment down below if you're native a
radio fan what what is this hair doing
it is just going to be a chill snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A video different background we are in
my living room right now I'm kind of
feeling this background kind of want to
like bring my ring light in here one
time and film fast you guys to snap me
questions and then there's also some
questions on Instagram so we're just
going to open up the snaps and I'm
really excited I love when I get to see
your guys's faces we're just going to go
down to the bottom here holy crap
they're done what is your career or job
why did you live in Jordan so I
graduated college a couple years ago I
did a whole video on how to get a job
out of college it kind of goes through
my background how I ended up in
marketing I met some amazing people
throughout the last few jobs I've had I
believe in hard work and timing and I
think if you do those two things good
things come your way and now moved into
doing freelance digital marketing which
basically means that now I get to make
my own hours work from home have a few
different clients and I just love being
my own boss just like mentally and
physically on my body I've been killing
myself the last two years working like
60 hours a week between a full-time job
and YouTube on the weekends it didn't
really have a day off ever so I just
feel like I'm in a super good place with
my mental health and work-life balance
which I've never really before had so I
feel super fortunate that I've somehow
ended up here where I am now she has
something about Jordan did she say why
didn't I live in Jordan I lived in
Jordan for a year in college I was today
Arabic okay let's do a video this is
from Samantha actually hey Taylor just
wondering when will be your next meeting
grief if you will do what if you'll
travel do one you should have a Texas I
don't know if I'm going to be in Texas
anytime soon but I definitely want to do
a me agree I've never done like a plan B
agree I think I secretly have this fear
that like no one's going to show up I
typically go to like a couple of the
conventions every year so I think next
time I'm at one of those we'll probably
play a meeting great around that what is
the most embarrassing thing that has
ever happened to you most embarrassing
thing that's happened to me in public I
was in high school I tore my ACL
meniscus and I had crutches and I was
going down the bleachers on crutches for
like an assembly and it was packed and
thing was like for prom or something and
I full-on slid down the entire staircase
thank you so much that makes me really
happy when you guys told me things like
that because that's pretty much the
reason why I started YouTube back when I
did because there was no one that had
pale skin that I could find glad that I
can help some of you guys out that way
Adam McKenna says I recently started
suffering from migraines do you have any
tips to help deal with them sorry that
you recently started suffering from them
my best tip is I think just like
thinking as positively as you can about
it I personally feel like I value time
and feeling good a lot a lot more than
people who have zero health problems
things that you actually feel good
there's not a whole lot of them so you
have to do things and go out and be
productive when you can because
don't know the next time that you're
actually going to feel good so I feel
like the positive side of that would be
you value time a lot more and spending
time with people that you care about and
making the most out of your days okay
some bum seventy-three who is the most
famous person you've ever met most
famous person I've ever met was Justin
Timberlake I got a picture with him in
Big Bear one time would you ever
consider doing YouTube full time says
glitter or Never Say Never but I don't
think I would ever be fully satisfied
unless I had like a major side project
that I was working on that like went
along with YouTube I think that I put
too much of my identity in what I do I
really like pride myself on being a hard
worker in my career and I think if I
didn't have that I would kind of be lost
which I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing but I I love
working if it was something that I
didn't enjoy doing and I never really
like found my thing or like my calling
in life I would stop and do something
else I don't think you should ever be in
a job that you hate or like a career
path that you hate you make your own
choices you choose to invest your time
in different things if you want to learn
how to be a developer go learn how to
code if you don't try then you'll
literally never know what you're gonna
blonde grunter says what made you
embrace your pale skin by no Jordan
really made me a brace mchale skin I'm
going to go too much into this because I
did a whole video on how to embrace your
pale skin I'm gonna link that down below
if you guys haven't seen it for new here
that really goes into my whole journey
Kaitlyn Mikayla
seven what is your favorite part of
being a beauty blogger what is your view
on your future and be blogging she also
asked that's a good question I've never
been asked what my favorite part of
being a beauty blogger is I don't think
I would definitely say connecting with
you guys whenever I do live streams and
stuff or I actually meet you guys if
life it makes all this real I think
whenever I get to actually see that what
I'm doing make some kind of impact even
if it's small I think that's what my
favorite part of doing what I do is I
also really liked meeting YouTube
friends in real life it's always so
awesome when you get to meet these
people that you would have never crossed
paths with spiffy TIFF eg saris not
focusing on the snap when I open it have
I changed my hair and makeup since I
went lighter I've changed my hiccups
I've changed my eyebrow shade lip colors
I definitely had to change I think once
I'm into the super like platinum silver
kind of hair I can go back to what I was
wearing when I was black because it
really gets to ends of the spectrum when
you're kind of in the middle here I feel
like I have to be more cautious with
what I put on my face amber six six nine
five 5g always is in live streams and
snaps me so thank you amber Neela wants
to know when you're going to get a peel
box
I got rid of my p.o box probably a year
ago a new apartment is a lot better at
receiving packages than my old one was I
used to always get stuff sent back I
might get a peel back soon I don't know
let me know down below if you guys want
a few blocks okay Hanna Lucia what is
your favorite kind of breed out again
I'm all-time fair brito is bean and
cheese is guacamole and hot sauce el
pecho hot sauce that you can get at
Safeway or on Amazon is the best I take
it with me when I go get my burritos
that's how good it is hey Bryce c21 hi
Taylor
how my question is how have you come to
accept your acne and your skin and still
be confident enough to show yourself on
camera that's an interesting question
because I feel like actually showing
yourself on camera for me is a lot
different than going outside without any
makeup on and showing my acne I don't
know why but I think there's some kind
of like disconnect between the camera
and real life if that makes sense
especially when I first started YouTube
you're sitting in your room by yourself
talking to a camera and you don't even
think people are going to watch you so I
think that's what initial
made me feel okay with it once you start
putting content out you kind of realize
that other people can connect to that
because they also look like that are
they also feel the same way what helps
me now is knowing that I'm confident in
myself and any negative comment that I'm
going to get about my skin doesn't
really affect me because I know myself
and I know what I'm doing what was high
school like for you what clubs were even
yes love you I was personally someone
who hated high school I had an amazing
freshman and sophomore year of high
school
I had a really great boyfriend in high
school I did gymnastics and tennis
around high school
really good friends the first couple
years and then once we broke up I kind
of just went downhill which is one of my
biggest tips if you're in high school
like do you make your own friends
because things happen
I was always someone who was really
independent I had a lot of friends I
just never had people that I felt like I
could fully count on I'm someone who
would rather have like two or three
super close friends who really know
where I am and understand me then like
20 people I just kind of always doing my
own thing in high school most of my good
friends throughout high school lived in
other parts of the state high school
wasn't really my thing high school is
not the end of the world your life just
goes up after high school you're going
to learn so much and grow so much the
few years after high school that you're
literally not even going to everything
back to what high school was like I'm
just hungry
give us advice for someone who's looking
to make start Channel but isn't college
one has healthy shoes tell fabulous so
that was exactly me I was in college and
I
chronic migraines for 14 years now so I
know exactly where you're coming from
do it if it makes you feel happy and
it's a way to like it's kind of escape
from everything else that you're dealing
with if it's an added stress basically
be doing it for the right reasons
since I don't really have a super
creative major me it was something where
I can express myself and express my
creativity and it was kind of like an
outlet for me so I feel like it really
helps me kind of get away from
schoolwork and like channel my energy
into something else but if it's ever
something that feels forced or you're
not enjoying don't do it along with
anything else in life like spend your
time where it's going to be impactful
for you
Nadine Byron says what made you want to
start beauty blogging youtubing your
career what made you want to start your
youtube beauty bloggers career first of
all when I started I never once ever
thought that it YouTube could be a
career I literally remember my mom asked
me one time like do you think you'll get
200,000 subscribers over and I was like
no like not happening I don't even think
I thought I was going to get to 10,000
or 5,000 I remember getting the first
few hundred subscribers was like holy
 was like mind-boggling to me what
was your dream job as a kid so I'm gonna
leave the mom tag down below because my
mom answered that question pretty
interesting dream Drop dream assistant
timestream job go check it out I also
have the dad tag
I'll leave both both those down below a
lot of these questions too I feel like
we kind of touched on there so if you
haven't seen those and you want to learn
more about how I grew up and everything
like that and go watch those two videos
in this channel ask do you have a
boyfriend do you live on your own do you
miss your black hair at all and what are
your favorite videos to do so one I do
not have a boyfriend you know anyone in
the Seattle area help a sister out I
have a roommate I live
my own in the sense that I paid for
everything myself but I do have a
roommate she's awesome she's out of town
right now but she rocks do you miss your
black hair at all yes
just because I'm at this color right now
thank you guys by the way for all the
positive feedback on this color of hair
I personally would never keep my hair
this color I just don't like it on
myself very like black or white and all
aspects of life really have issues
getting dressed with this hair color
doing makeup with this hair color I feel
like it's not my style I really am
looking forward to the silver hair and I
do think I'll be back to black at some
point what are your favorite videos to
do
I've never videos to do are probably
first impression videos you had a globe
and you spun it around with your eyes
closed where would you hope it would
land
that's a good question I've never heard
that probably Morocco Chris 7 says what
age has been your favorite lives so far
and why I think my first year out of
college so my first year living in
Seattle I felt like a girl on college
but that year afterwards in like the
real world I feel like I grew so much
learned so much professionally and just
personally about myself I was put in
situations that I never would have
signed up for in college I did stuff
that I never thought I would be doing
public speaking I just learned the time
I met amazing people at the job I was in
feel like I had the best case scenario
coming out of college and I worked
freaking hard for it and when one 6:9
says if a crystal ball could tell you
the truth about yourself your life the
future or anything else what would you
want to know who these are some unique
questions kind of thing I want to know
if and when I was going to meet someone
because if I wasn't going to meet the
person until I'm like 35 I'm just going
like chill not even waste my time on
tinder and Bumble I'm someone that
definitely wants to adopt a child if I
don't meet someone and have a child with
someone before I need to like body wise
so I guess I wanted that twat waffle
303's long-term life goals my career is
super important to me I only want to
you find someone who I consider a best
friend that I want to spend the rest of
my life with hopefully in the next five
or six years like by the time I'm 30 and
I just want to be happy and I want to be
healthy that's a big one and I want my
family to be happy and healthy too all
right so I think that's all the
questions I'm going to ask today I feel
like this video is probably super long
but if you're watching this comment the
word banana leaf if you're watching this
still right now thank you for watching
like you don't get the chance enough to
tell you guys how much I truly love you
