right so today we are going to be doing
empties and I literally feel like I
could fit as my child in this thing I've
literally been collecting these for like
the last probably 3 or 4 months
I don't think I've done an empty video
and a freaking long time I have a ton so
I'm either gonna split this up into two
videos or just power through this right
now if you don't know what empties
videos are it's basically where I show
you my trash they're kind of like mini
reviews on each product I like watching
empties videos because these are things
that I have fully used up these are
things I use on a daily basis or I was
at some point this there what are you
doing man I do have a shadow in shmooze
video on the look I'm wearing right now
so if you want to know how to get this
makeup look I'll link it in the
description box down below and you can
go watch it let's just hop in because
this is a little intense so the first
thing I have is my toothpaste this is a
toothpaste ooh what is on here let's
just wrap that back up this is the
Colgate optic white toothpaste I love
this toothpaste and the mouthwash which
let's just do this at the same time also
have the mouthwash version
these aren't amazing amazing teeth
whitening products I do use whitening
trays but only like once every four or
five months this is what I use in
between and it keeps my teeth looking
white these do not taste that great
these don't taste as good as the crest
what's it called whitening you know
they're whitening line doesn't taste as
good as that but it's doable and it
actually works I had two of the possibly
three at the bottom of the Neutrogena
makeup wipes I haven't been using these
for a while I've been using their makeup
removing like cleansing oil and then
also just other wipes because I feel
like I have five thousand wipes right
now from random brands I'm trying out I
always go back to these though these are
the best makeup wipes I've ever found
for removing like your full face and
also waterproof eye makeup you haven't
tried these out in ooh something smells
really good so I have two candles these
are both from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works these
are from like probably three years ago
two or three years ago I'm pretty sure I
brought these up from college oh that's
probably why you're looking at these I'm
thinking
seeing this design in a while kale gate
is probably one of my favorites that
smells freakin amazing Berkeley icicles
smells similar but more man Kendyl II
and less like woodsy this is like a
fresh showered man with like a lot of
Cologne this is the Burt's Bees
fabulously fresh peppermint and rosemary
Body Wash this I really like the smell
of this smelled really good it is 99.2%
natural this didn't lather at all which
is why I probably wouldn't repurchase
this but I do like the fresh smell of it
baby wipes nothing too exciting here
I just keep these in my makeup drawer to
use to wipe off my palettes and just
wipe off my hands and things when I'm
doing makeup have a Too Faced better
than sex mascara this is my Holy Grail
mascara I use this every single day any
mascara that I use now after this just
like it doesn't even compare my top on
this one actually came off I know what
it is about this brush and the formula
is perfect they're coming out with a
waterproof version which I'm super
excited about I don't usually like
recommending mascara because everyone's
mascara preferences are so different a
mascara that can work amazing for
someone is like for someone else
but personally I've been loving this I'm
a bed head TIGI resurrection number 3
shampoo this was fine it smelled a
little bit too sweet for my liking and
it just doesn't lather like drugstore
shampoos I haven't found a high-end
shampoo that I'm like completely in love
with I just stick with drugstore and it
works a lot better for me than any
high-end shampoo and conditioner I've
ever tried though I don't know let me
know your favorite high-end lines but I
just got this from like TJ Maxx or
something for a lot cheaper than it
normally is have a Head and Shoulders
instant relief and dry shampoo this has
peppermint complex and tea tree essence
I wanted something that like made your
scalp kinda tingle for some reason I got
on this whole thing at like 2:00 in the
morning one time about like tingly
shampoos and ended up ordering this on
like Amazon the smell smelled really
peppermint tea and fresh food didn't
really make my scalp tingle or anything
and I didn't notice this helping with my
dandruff that much so I probably
wouldn't repurchase this I have a
Clairol number 3 conditioner I think Sam
Sherman was the one who said to I the
Clairol or color just to get this
condition
it is freaking amazing I wish they made
this in like a full-size conditioner
they have a blue-black dye and I switch
between that and the East Lawn dive just
depending on what I have and if I have
to get something like last-minute but I
really like that and this conditioner is
also bomb next I have these skin Iceland
hydro cooling firming eye gels these are
just little like I mask things that you
put on underneath your eyes and let them
sit there I thought it was okay I didn't
think these were like revolutionaries as
I supposed to do puff and firm within
ten minutes
puffiness isn't really one of my big eye
problem so maybe if you have super puffy
eyes it would help so I have two of the
Neutrogena all-in-one acne daily scrub
and this is just what I always purchased
from Neutrogena this is my face wash I
haven't been using an exfoliator every
single day I use this probably every two
or three days now just when I feel like
my skin needs a good scrub also
something from Neutrogena that I still
feel like really helps my acne but I've
stopped using because in my nighttime
skincare routine a lot of people said
that this has a ton of alcohol in it
this is the acne stress control toner by
the way a lot of people says it has a
ton of alcohol in it which is good for
drying up your acne for a short term
solution but overall I guess it's not
good for your skin though I don't know I
might ask my dermatologist about this
and see what she thinks
but in the meantime I haven't been using
this I've been using a Polish twice
toner instead just found another one I
have three of these these are the
L'Oreal infallible Pro makeup setting
spray I love this I feel like I'll
continue to repurchase this I have like
two backups right now I just stock up
every time they go on sale and I do go
through these pretty fast because I
spray a ton on my face everyday but I
love these and I feel like they work so
I have the body shop tea tree pore
minimizer and this is just a really nice
neutral kind of primer I don't think it
really does anything different for your
makeup and I don't really think it
minimizes your pores either but if you
have acne prone skin and you just want
to prep your skin before you're putting
something on top of it this is a good
option I do still
purchases so I like it enough to
repurchase it have another better than
sex this is the tiny version that I
think I started with I have this L'Oreal
ever pure sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner I think I've literally had
these sitting in here for probably over
like five months cuz I don't even
remember the last time I use this but I
love this line this is the rosemary mint
scent and their shampoo and conditioner
are amazing I'll be repurchasing these
once I go through my five thousand
bottles of stocked up shampoo and
conditioner than I have right now I'm
like one of those people that just like
hoard drugstore stuff so I would really
have a little pharmacy but definitely
recommend this and it's sulfate free so
if you color your hair this is great
this is from Clairol this is their hair
food apricot mask this was okay I don't
think it's us amazing as their
conditioner that just comes in the hair
color but scent is nice a little too
apricot II for me I don't think it like
is a miracle hair product or anything
but it works just found another
Neutrogena white I have four deodorants
here and this is like hoarding at its
finest I have the secret outlast three
different version this is all secret I
really actually like the Brazil Sam but
I can't find it anywhere I don't know if
they discontinued it was new when I
bought it
this is rainforest Smiths oh here's the
Crest toothpaste I was talking about so
this is the crest 3d white that's what
it's called
again this is fine but I really like the
Colgate one better some more baby wipes
have a Neutrogena Naturals face wipe I
didn't like these nearly as much as
their blue packaging the scent was like
a little bit too weird for me a little
like strong and also these burned in my
eyes a little bit they just didn't get
off all the makeup like the blue ones do
so I wouldn't repurchase these I have a
body shop tea tree face mask that I
fully used up I love this I will
continue to repurchase this I like full
you cleared this out tea tree oil is
great for acne so if you have acne try
this out I really like body shop
products I have two of my Holy Grail
Physicians Formula correcting powders I
use these to set my under eye powder if
you have pale skin in the shade is light
enough it is beautiful have an Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer and this kind
of pisses me off because there's still a
ton of product like on the walls of the
container but I've tried everything and
I can't
get this out but this is in the shade
fair neutral I love this concealer this
in the collection concealer are my
favorite concealers right now light
enough if you appeal skin it doesn't
crease full coverage totally worth the
money in my opinion if you haven't tried
this out yet have my manic panic
dreamtone what you guys knows my
foundation Lightner I've talked about
this for years I have a whole review on
it really old ones it's just a white
foundation mixer since this came out a
lot of new foundation mixers have come
out ever trying out the NYX one and a
few other brands and be having the whole
video coming soon on foundation mixers
and how to use them and the best ones
and the worst ones this is the Laura
Mercier foundation primer this isn't the
illuminating one it just says protect
and this has SPF 30 in it I actually
feel like this made my foundation stay
on longer I think I'm gonna repurchase
this because I actually just forgot
about it until now
it feels more like a lotion it doesn't
have that silicone consistency so this
is the amber sparkle exfoliating butter
scrub from Ulta this smelled so good it
was like fully gone I love the packaging
how beautiful is this hombre and gold I
would repurchase this I don't think they
make it anymore or they might just
change the packaging but I do really
like the ultra amber line I actually
really like the Ulta body line in
general have the Pacifica Coco pure
makeup removing wipes these I was not a
fan of don't even try to remove her eye
makeup with use this I ended up just
actually using for my makeup area like
how I use big whites because it's kind
of like worthless for your face so I
have Maybelline falsies volume express
mascara this was from so long ago I
can't believe this is actually in here
because I don't actually remember the
last time I use this this is the curved
brush mascara I used to be obsessed with
this I kind of want to try this again
just to see how it compares to Too Faced
better than sex since I've used that for
so long but this is a really awesome
drugstore mascara Maybelline fit me
concealer in 1515 is actually lighter
than the shade 10 so 10 was too dark for
you try 15 is still a little bit too
dark for me but with a lighter powder to
set it it works I do really like this
concealer I think it's a great drugstore
concealer this is the old about Tim and
deep I love this every
this like four or five times down swish
up my brow routine a little bit since I
got permanent brows done mmm well you
have a whole video on but I do love this
brow gel it's at a brow gel sets your
brows and I just really like the color
my throat wants to kill me right now but
we're gonna keep going this is a sample
of the mac prolongwear concealer in nw15
I have never been that much of a fan of
mac prolongwear it just doesn't look
that great on my skin have this animal
mask which was really exciting this is a
panda face mask
I don't think sheet masks do that much
for my skin but they're exciting to put
on to more things
I have this huge attack of spa
essentials cotton rounds this was from
Cosmo Prof I got this with my cousin she
has her license so we were able to go to
Cosmoprof I thought these were gonna be
like professional-grade
cotton around and these were just pretty
crappy like they shed all over my face I
was actually really happy when I finally
finished these up so I could switch con
rounds last thing is the suave dry
shampoo this is the Moroccan infusion
dry shampoo
this is the best dry shampoo I found for
actually removing the oil but it does
have a little bit of a white cap so you
have to be careful like the angle that
you spray it in things because sometimes
you can have like a straight up white
line that you have to like blend out but
for being a cheap dry shampoo this does
the job so that was everything if you
guys like empties videos let me know by
giving this video a thumbs up love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
