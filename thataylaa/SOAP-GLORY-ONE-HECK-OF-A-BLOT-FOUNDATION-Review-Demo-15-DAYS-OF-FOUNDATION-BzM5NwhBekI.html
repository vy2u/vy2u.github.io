of foundation if you're new here this is
where we are trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days if you
missed the other days I'm gonna link
everything you need to know down below
in the description box but today we're
doing the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a
block foundation and primer something
Laura's makeup line is pretty new you
can find them in Ulta this one retailed
for $19 which I feel like is super
reasonable it's kind of in-between
drugstore and high-end which I like
you get one fluid ounce of product and
then the primer retails for $14 which I
also feel like it's pretty affordable if
you think about some drugstore products
like the L'Oreal Lumi cushion that was
$17 at most places so the fact that this
is 19 is pretty good so let's just read
some of the claims on the website it
comes in four shades which is a little
disappointing I'm assuming that since
they just launched this foundation
they're kind of seeing how it goes and
then we'll open it up to more shades but
I have the lightest shade which is fair
enough so it says that you get fabulous
flawless full coverage all day liquid to
powder foundation with shine block 12
hour long wear technology and super blur
powders offers ultimate shine control
designed to give skin a flawless non
cakey soft focus finish perfection in a
bottle that sounds great so you
guys will see what I think about those
claims as I apply this foundation so if
you want to see what I think of the one
heck of a blot foundation of primer
you're in the right place just keep
watching
okay so in real life time there's been a
day between day four and today's video
and my face is looking pretty horrible I
have a huge set right here right here
just breaking out all over the place I
feel like I don't know if it's just from
trying out a ton of different products
I'm assuming that's what it's from okay
so I'm going to apply the one heck of a
blot instant perfecting pore primer to
one half of my face I'm use it on the
right side of my face only it just has
to say yesterday because I want to have
some kind of opinion for you guys
primers are kind of hard to do first
impressions on I feel like and I really
like this I use this with the targeting
force of the C foundation which I'm
obsessed with if you miss that review it
was day three I think I'll put it right
here all the previous day's are linked
down below and playlist if you missed
him but I put that underneath the Tarte
foundation and I feel like it literally
made my face look flawless all day long
it looked like I just applied my
foundation at the end of the night which
is amazing so I do really like this
primer with that foundation it gives you
kind of like a sticky yeah sticky
consistency look fingers gently glide
over it at all like senses mattifying
your skin looking at the outside of this
this is a little bit frightning this
looks super dark
I wore my crisscross top to hopefully
distract people from my face if I look
like an oompa loompa but we're just
going to blend down the neck and hope
for the best so you can really do in
life you know I'm just shaking this up
so I wanted to do shade comparisons
again because I feel like I don't know
hopefully this is helpful and a down
below if you guys like seeing these so
this first foundation right here is the
soap &amp;amp; Glory one heavy black foundation
the next one is the Catrice foundation
from yesterday third one over is Mac and
w10 Studio Fix this one is two-faced
Born This Way in snow and then over here
is Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in 110
here are some swatches for you on the
back of here it says after moisturizing
use your fingers or brush to dab a few
dots to the center of your forehead nose
and chin blend centrally and then rub
any excess outwards onto your cheeks so
you're easily supposed to blend from
like the set
your face out I usually actually apply
my foundation the other way because I
feel like I have more to cover up down
here but let's do what they say
we'll see suppose people coverage looks
a little dark so since I'm doing just
the right side of my face when I try and
like let me put this on so first I'm
going to use the brush on the side of
face I'm going to put the Beautyblender
on the other side
this is supposed to be kind of like a
liquid to powder foundation okay so that
amount of product did not cover enough
of my face so I'm going to go in and
just dip my brush in here
kind of stipple it on the rest of my
face it seems to kind of adjust to your
skin tone which is nice it looks a lot
darker when I first put it on and then
once it kind of sits up here it actually
dress really nicely I don't think they
claimed to be
shada jesting but it's like it is not
the easiest to blend out it looks kind
of passion over here going in for kind
of a second layer to make everything
blend and give a little bit more
coverage since it does dry almost
instantly you have to work super fast
with this and putting a second layer on
it looks a little bit cakey yeah my face
definitely looks like I'm wearing
foundation feel like I applied quite a
bit and it doesn't look full coverage to
me this is like a medium to high medium
coverage you can still see acne freckles
even peeking through up here let's cover
up this thing so I'm going with the
sponge on the other side starting from
the center ish so just with that one
thin layer with a sponge it looks like a
light to medium coverage to me I'm going
to go in for a second layer and see if
we can get it to this kind of coverage
without looking cakey okay so after two
layers I think I got it - like a high
medium coverage definitely don't think
this is full coverage there's some funky
stuff going on on my face so I'm going
to show you guys a close-up definitely
was more buildable with the sponge
overall I definitely like how it looks
with a sponge better looks a lot less
cakey and we'll show you guys what is
going on let's do a close-up so looks
pretty heavy cakey and streaky on my
nose I don't know if you guys can see
that on camera but there's basically
like a line right here where it kind of
dried and didn't fully blend out also
happened right here where the foundation
is basically clinging to my upper lip
right here you can see it didn't fully
cover this area but pretty decent
coverage on here it just doesn't
look that great definitely looks pretty
dry on my forehead I know it's supposed
to be a matte finish but it does look
really heavy and cakey in my opinion
we're just going to go over this with
the sponge without any product on it and
just try and blend this out a little bit
more pretty much powder finish so that
could be why if you're putting a second
layer on top of powder that can look
extra cakey but it doesn't supposed to
be full coverage and for me to even get
close to full coverage I definitely had
to do two layers I can tell them and get
major mouth line creasing today because
it already starting to crease and it
just looks super heavy on my upper lip
I'm really curious to see let's actually
do that on camera I'm curious to see how
the under eye concealers going to blend
out because since this is basically a
powder putting liquid on a powder
usually doesn't go too well so let's see
how concealer apply this underneath the
eyes the fur concealer I'm using I could
trace liquid camouflage concealer if you
missed yesterday's video is a kasturi's
foundation with this concealer I really
like this I'm going to apply some under
the I hope blends out okay luckily it's
Sunday right now the day before fourth
of July's so if I can't leave the house
today it's not a big deal okay
yeah this is kind of exactly what I
thought was going to happen oh no this
is drying extra fast on top of this and
it's basically like trying to blend the
liquid on top of them powder I'm going
with the sponge because I feel like I
need that so when you apply this
foundation I would definitely suggest
applying your under-eye concealer first
oh man
this is bad I'm going to show you guys a
texture on this up close okay so if you
can see right here there's kind of a
whole circle where the foundation
basically stops and you can see it and
here's the under-eye concealer this
looks like liquid this looks like cakey
powder oh man this looks so bad there is
so much texture look at that what is it
so pores right there look huge which
I've never seen before you can see right
here the streakiness of this foundation
um okay so I probably wouldn't leave the
house like this
it looks pretty horrible but for you
guys I'm going to keep this
on I'm going to apply the rest of my
makeup and keep this on till the end of
the night so before I apply mascara and
lips and stuff I'm going to use a
setting spray because I feel like this
is the only thing that might make my
skin look decent
this is that fix plus this is a good
setting spray if you have a super
powdery foundation and you just kind of
want to make your face look more like
skin before we do this my top lip feels
super heavy like powdery foundation
highlight was a little bit difficult to
blend out blush and bronzer was fine it
should be great because I'm blending on
top of the super powdery finish so I'm
gonna apply some of this it just
basically took a shower in this stuff so
if this doesn't work I know it will okay
so the rest of my makeups on it's now
10:43 in the morning I went for an
intense look so it's the only thing that
was making me feel semi these in so this
is the BG lipstick in the shade metal
diva these rock more moosie finishes but
they're super long-lasting looking at
the face mac fix+ helped a little bit it
still looks super cakey I said in my
face where I use this sponge definitely
looks less cakey this side looks pretty
horrible especially on the forehead
center of my face and my upper lip those
are the areas that look really bad the
cheek area looks fine right off the bag
and say if you have dry skin stay away
from this even if you have combo skin
it's just not sitting on my face really
well it could just be my skin but I
think this is really for the oily oily
oily people as far as the full coverage
claim I don't think this is full
coverage I think that you can get it to
like a high coverage so the shade
doesn't look horrible if you look
compared to my chest it definitely is a
couple shades darker but it doesn't look
horrible horrible shade wise definitely
more of a yellow tone foundation so like
it says 10:45 I'm going to keep this on
as long as humanly possible and we will
be back to check in throughout the day
okay so it's no 243 so the Foundation's
been on for almost four hours I didn't
think it was possible to look shittier
but it has happened so there's some
really weird stuff going on on my upper
lip it basically looks like I have a
foundation mustache all you literally
been doing is
editing a breakfast and I didn't even
wipe my mouth at all I don't know what
happened but basically the foundation
has totally worn off in certain areas
and gotten super super patchy i'ma show
you guys a close-up so you can see what
I mean but around my nose there's
creasing the rest of my face looks okay
definitely not getting oily or shiny at
all
so I'm going to show you guys my lip
right now okay so right here what is
going on you guys see that I've never
had that happen with the foundation like
I said I didn't wipe it or anything I
didn't even touch my upper lip and it's
totally worn off cakey patchy look how
thick it looks right here it's basically
all caked up right here this just looks
horrible
so as you can see that just looks pretty
shitty or to editing these clips back
and I think I said horrible like a
hundred times I need a new Hydra tube
not looking good so I'm gonna try and
keep this on for a few more hours I
don't think there's any going up from
here but I kinda do want to see how it
controls the oil on my forehead so I am
going to keep wearing it at least
attempt to rice it is now 8:40 to PN the
Foundation's been on for almost exactly
10 hours as far as controlling the oil
my forehead looks a lot less shiny than
it normally does my face definitely
still looks matte it looks super kicking
around my nose area like it was earlier
except worse mouth lines again the upper
lip is just not cute it is coming off on
my hairline up here kind of looks like
I'm wearing a mask I think you guys
understand how I feel about this at this
point on in the video I do think it
could be worth trying if you're someone
who is extremely oily and who likes a
light to medium coverage that way you
don't have to build up the layers I
think part of the issue might have been
doing two layers as it did turn out
pretty cakey but again a promise full
coverage and if I can't get full
coverage on the first layer that I'm
going to apply a second layer so I don't
know i might try mixing this in with
like a super luminous foundation and see
how it works I do think it kept me mad I
don't think it looks great the prime
side and the not prime side look pretty
close I actually think this one looks a
little bit more matte what do you guys
think if you're oily and need something
to help modify your t-zone I do
like this primer so far I will continue
to use this primer and try it out with
different foundations like I said I
really liked it the Tarte reinforce of
the C foundation so this I think is
worth it from me this foundation really
didn't work out but again ways watch
different reviews on different skin
types and see how it works differently
for different people should we say
different again I personally don't like
it sorry this one was a bust but I just
being honest with you guys if you guys
liked this video and you're excited for
the rest of 15 days of foundation give
it a thumbs up so I know like always you
can always call me requests down below
love you guys thanks for watching see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
