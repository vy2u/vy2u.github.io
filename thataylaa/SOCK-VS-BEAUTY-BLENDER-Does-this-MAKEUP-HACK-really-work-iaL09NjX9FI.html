putting a sock on our face not sponsored
by Puma but Puma hit a girl up so
originally saw mayro touch of glam and
try this out and was super intrigued I'm
gonna leave her original video down
below but today we are going to be
putting this to the test and seeing if a
sock can apply foundation as well as a
Beauty Blender if this works we maybe
some socks to apply foundation for the
rest of our lives before you do this
make sure you have a clean sock I don't
personally use fabric softener but if
you do just be aware that that can break
you out on your body and if you put it
on your face probably not good if you
liked this video while you're watching
it don't forget to give it a thumbs up
and subscribe if you're not already so
if you guys want to see if a stock can
be due for the beauty blender you're in
the right place just keep watching so
I'm gonna try to stop on this side of my
face in the Beauty Blender on this side
my face we are going to see how well the
stock covers I'm one of those days where
this eyelash went on so different it's
like up to my brow this one is just
chill foundation I'm using is Too Faced
Born This Way because I feel like a lot
of people have this foundation and now
how it applies in all black and stuff I
do a full review on this by the way so
when choosing the stock you want to make
sure that this part is pretty squishy
and soft you don't want to be giving
yourself an exfoliation while you apply
your foundation but this one is fairly
soft it's the most cushy one I found so
what you want to do is roll it inwards
like you're rolling kind of a soft bun
and you're going to get this cushy thing
that looks like a hacky sack so since
you just rolled the sock inward there's
a lot of cushion here mine is a little
bit bumpy but it'll do so I'm going to
dive on something Foundation and then
blend out let this talk okay let's do
this
all right definitely think we need more
foundation so I'm just going to pump
that right on the sock
okay I'm just looking super textured on
my face like you can feel like I'm
stamping the sock fabric on my face I
know how you're supposed to get in these
kind of areas with a sock okay that is
definitely giving me some major texture
and it feels like it's soaking up a ton
of the product
I usually don't need this much of this
foundation and my sock is on my
face that's awesome I'm going to go in
with the Beauty Blender before this
dries and then go in for a second layer
okay this isn't even like comparable
first of all this one doesn't feel like
I'm cutting a rock on my face and
actually get into these areas with the
Beauty Blender definitely way less
texture with the sponge let's try and do
the forehead maybe the forehead is
different seems like it applies best
when you put it directly on this even
though it soaks up a ton of product
yeah this is soaking up a ton of product
looks pretty horrible let's good to see
the stock I'm using but like how
different can Asaf be you can't even
blend this so I'm going to go back in
with the sponge
I'm gonna give this guy one last chance
going with a second layer I'm going to
like I'm wasting so much product right
now
there's just no way to actually blend
this like it applies product to the face
and soaks up half of it but this isn't a
good material to blunt with just so you
guys can see him give you a close-up
real quick see all the texture in here
like you can't actually blend that out
right I'm gonna have to ditch the sponge
for the rest of this so we can actually
get foundation on her face but looking
like a hot mess all right all in all I
think this is fun to try everyone has a
stock laying around so go whip it out
and try it but for me it was a total
fail did not work at all if you're
looking for a cheaper alternative to the
Beauty Blender the Real Techniques
sponge works just as well if not better
and it's six or seven bucks which if you
think about it is the same price as a
pack of socks if you're going to try
this out
may the odds be ever in your favor if
you guys like this video and you want to
see more videos like this give it a
thumbs up so I know love you guys thanks
for watching see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
