alright so today it's foundation Friday
this is where I try out a new foundation
every single Friday on my channel I have
a mall and a playlist down below but
today we're trying out one from Ulta
which I was really curious about this
only had I think seven reviews haven't
heard anything about this it's the old
two Beauty full coverage HD liquid
foundation ulties in-house brand for me
has been a little bit hit or miss there
are a couple products I really like and
a lot of products I don't like so it
just kind of depends and you have a
couple other foundation reviews from
their brand retails for 14 bucks it has
one fluid ounce product in it and it
comes in 10 shades I have the lightest
shade which is light cool there's not a
whole lot of info on here but it just
says it'll leave your skin appearing
naturally flawless perfect choice for an
Instagram where the picture spherical
powders help to create a soft focus
finish and a smooth even complexion says
it's full coverage it's vegan finish on
here just says natural finish so I'm
going to serve swatches right here so
you can see what the lightest shade
looks like compared to some my other
foundations I say here a few swatches
right here is the old foundation and the
lightest shade light cool next over is
CYO life proof in 101 I should probably
switch nails here let me give you my
fourth finger
sounds like totally gypped that's kind
of hard NARS natural radiant foundation
in Mont Blanc
Marc Jacobs remarkable in 10 make up
forever matte velvet plus and 15 if your
cosmetics paradol foundation in
porcelain you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the baby
doe family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. 6 time
here we go Alta HD full coverage liquid
foundation
alright so it's about 9:15 in the
morning I've been trying to start
filming this for like 10 minutes and
I've had the hiccups this entire time so
hopefully they're staying away now
like this has a pump in its the squeeze
tube good packaging but travel with easy
to get out can't really complain
looks pretty thick on the back of this
pallet it's not really moving around and
we start out the sponge on this side of
my face I've already washed moisturize
pressed my skin like I usually do and
everything I use will be down below
doesn't seem to have a scent at all and
it did say it's fragrance free I like
that because fragrance can irritate your
skin
and it's just unnecessary like why do we
have to put fragrance in our foundations
the shade is looking like a pretty good
match with the sponge it's sitting on my
skin pretty nice it does look almost
like soft focus
so black what is that please hold I have
a black hair on my face like where do
those come from it's looking really nice
and smooth it does look like a true
satin finish I don't know what's
happening right here I think for some
reason I have a major crease right there
I think it might just be my face don't
know if I like slept on it weird or
something it feels pretty lightweight
easy to blend out let's say this is
pretty much local coverage right now
it's looking really nice on the center
of my forehead whoo sounds promising
okay I'm gonna go to my ELF ultimate
blending brush on the other side really
need to wash my brushes right now
someone comment to the other day saying
that every time I wash my brushes I have
to tell you guys and it's so true
washing brushes is a accomplishment you
know I saying
when you deep clean like 40 brushes you
deserve an award it still looks pretty
nice and smooth on the brush side but I
feel like I'm getting about the same
coverage this side does look a little
bit more skin like it almost looks more
yellow when it first goes on I don't
know if you guys can tell on camera and
then it kind of turns a little bit more
pink or something so this one it doesn't
look bad with a brush but I definitely
prefer at the sponge side it just looks
a little bit more flattering I'm gonna
go in with just a tiny bit I kind of
wanna see if I can build this up not
using a lot of product at all and I'm
just gonna smooth everything out with a
sponge
yeah sponge is the way to go with this
one you get about the same coverage it
just gives it a really pretty finish I
would say it's about half the shade dark
oh it's looking good on my forehead
here's what I'm talking about where it
kind of creased right there don't know
why again I think it's just my face but
here's the finish and everything looks
nice I do still think that this side
this one side looks a bit better but
look at my forehead and my forehead
looks pretty damn good I would say this
is a true sad matte finish and I do
agree with the fact that it says it's
soft focus it is one of those matte
foundations which is almost a little bit
blurring if I'm going for a matte
foundation and that's what I go for if
you wanted up my favorite kind of matte
oil controlling foundations back when I
had oily skin I just did a video on it
for last week's foundation Friday
I like the coverage I like the shade
right now I'm feeling this one so we'll
see how it wears but it's 9:25 now did
that pretty quick I'm really tempted to
spray setting spray because I feel like
that would just take it to the next
level with this one but I won't oh heck
yeah and it also feels like it's setting
so yeah you could totally blend stuff on
top of this so I'm going to the rest of
my face and I'll be right back so right
now it's 9:55 working call the check-in
time 9:30 I did not have to set my face
which I love everything blended out
super easily on top of here one thing
I've noticed as this has been on my face
for a little bit longer is that it is
starting to look a little bit more
makeup II I can definitely see it more
on my forehead now and around my poor
area kind of just everywhere it just
looks a little bit more makeup II
doesn't look quite as like soft focus
anymore I don't think it looks bad right
now I'm just hoping it doesn't start to
look worse throughout the day and kind
of crease because I'm already getting
some creasing around my mouth area right
here and a little bit on my upper lip
actually already right now I'm liking it
I'm not as in love with it as I was a
half hour ago just because of how it's
changed it looks pretty nice still just
overall looks a little bit more like
makeup sitting on top of my face than it
did before so on the rest of my face
let me tell you I used the Physicians
Formula butter collection for the first
time today I've been so excited to try
this this is a little addition what is
this I think this is around 10 bucks or
something let me actually look this up
so this is about 12 bucks pending on
where you get it and all I'm wearing on
my face today is this guy so blush
bronzer highlight is from here I went in
with this shade this actually was a
little bit too dark and a little bit too
yellowy gold for my skin tone so I just
added a tiny bit of this other
Physicians Formula butter highlighter
this is in the shade pink rose love this
blush shade you guys know I love this
bronzer just wondering with this on the
crease of my eyes and then this on the
lid and inner corner and then this
perfume I don't know how this is 12
bucks normally one of these pans is
around like what 14 bucks when it's not
on sale this is like that scent on crack
it smells so freakin good this smells
like it could be a Victoria's Secret
perfume it has that really like warm
Vennela Eason but still a little bit
coconutty and beachy major mascaras
which are down below and then for lips
all I did was put on some lip gloss this
is the MUA
lip gloss in baby pink one of my
favorite shades of all time I didn't put
on a lip line or anything just wanted to
keep the lips a little bit more
natural-looking that is that's
everything that was hard to come out so
I'm gonna show you what this looks like
and natural lighting and then we'll do a
flash chest alright so I'm gonna have to
lighting right now here is what we're
looking like I'm gonna zoom in so I'm
getting some creasing especially in this
area already and my pores are looking a
little bit intense around here but pore
filling primer could help with that just
feel like in certain areas it is looking
a little bit crazy it just looked a bit
better half hour ago oh okay right here
you can kind of actually see the shade
better so I do think it is about half a
shade too dark you see the line right
here a little bit okay that makes your
bowl looks like I have a bob or
something there's definitely flash back
on this one because my body looks hell
tan in my face looks hella white but it
does look very soft focus it looks very
smoothing in flash to the finish of it
looks really flattering I'll see you
guys in a few hours for the next
check-in in natural lighting okay so
it's three o'clock how long has this
been on once I put it on it's been on
for about five and a half hours now so
my face has been quite it sheets I was
like a one more something outside right
now but my face has been pretty itchy
the past I would say three hours really
I didn't notice it for the first couple
hours I don't know if it's just because
I started using a retinol but I started
last week and every other foundation has
been fine so I don't know but my face is
feeling pretty Bernie especially around
here and on my forehead it's me it looks
pretty much the exact same as before
maybe slightly more satin on my forehead
I wouldn't really call it dewy but just
look a little bit more signage I like
and I don't think it necessarily looks
bad I think I just got a little bit too
wowed and excited at the beginning and
it just kind of got a little bit worse
so same exact thing but here is what
it's looking like at this point I think
I would wear this one again but I would
mix in just a tiny bit of like CYO
lifeproof probably to lighten it a
little bit and then also to make it a
little bit more smoothing just in like
the certain areas we're starting to look
a little bit makeup B so that's what I
probably do if I wear the skin and
definitely a setting sprays through
right now I'm gonna try and keep this on
a little bit longer and just you know
fan the face the burning goes down a
little bit so as you guys then okay so
it's almost 6 o'clock so it's been on
for about eight and a half hours and I
can't wait to wash this off my face
because my face is still burnin this
long bad doesn't look amazing I really
wish you'd just looked how it looked
when I first put it on I just kind of
settled and gotten a little bit heavier
looking but this might be one that I
just need to mix use a setting spray so
I'm gonna try it out in different ways
and see how it works I'm not like
totally rolling it out because there are
things that I like about it I like the
coverage and I do think still it has
kind of a soft focus finished just not
on my kind of problem areas but on the
other areas of my face so that's a plus
it has rubbed off kind of on my hairline
up here but I do think this has def
about it that I like enough to where I
could maybe potentially find a good
combo with this one not bad I mean I'm
not getting a ton of creasing or
separation it's mostly just this whole
area that I don't really like I think
this one some people would like and I
think I could probably find a way to
make this one work I hope you guys
enjoyed this foundation Friday if you
did don't forget to give it a thumbs up
I love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
