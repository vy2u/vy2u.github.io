exciting announcement 15 days of
foundation is coming up November 5th to
the 19th the series on my channel I
started a few months ago we're bringing
it back there will be a new video every
single day for 15 days 6 p.m. Pacific
time at 9 p.m. Eastern Time
don't know Mountain time 7 p.m. out time
I think so in my makeup declutter video
that I posted a few months ago link down
below if you haven't seen it I talked
about how now that I have this platform
I want to actually use it for something
other than just talking about makeup 15
days of foundation last time around just
got such an overwhelmingly positive
response from you guys and this time
around I wanted to do something more
with it so I made 15 days of foundation
t-shirts mama Bay radio helped me out
with this she made the brush to tell her
how good she did down below not only do
we have 15 days Foundation t-shirts but
this is very exciting because I found a
nonprofit that I'm super excited to tell
you guys about I talked about it on
snapchat a little bit last week but I'm
going to be donating half of all
proceeds so what I get after Amazon
takes their cut it donating half of the
proceeds to project we do share the
project via share is a nonprofit that
provides women in transition and women
in need homeless shelters with feminine
and beauty products I'm just going to
read a couple sentences off their
website because they explain it best
project Beauty share is an initiative to
collect cosmetics and beauty products
and distribute them through local
agencies to women of all ages whose
circumstances do not allow them to
afford these products women who are
poverty stricken or women in transition
cannot afford these luxury items a lot
of what we do is about health and
hygiene but is really about dignity
Project Beauty share wants to help women
regain their dignity and get back on
their feet and I think that's what a lot
of people don't realize sometimes with
donating makeup products it seems kind
of excessive or not like a need to
certain people but when you're trying to
get back on your feet and get a job and
go out into the world being able to take
a shower and put on makeup and do your
hair and do all those things that we do
on an everyday basis
can be really important and
only does project being share obviously
except donations which is what I'm doing
but you can also mail and used makeup
which i think is it's so incredible in
the declutter video I talked about how
you can donate use makeup to certain
shelters by bun some messages and emails
from the guys saying that shelters in
your area don't accept use makeup and it
is hard to find places that do the issue
with donating makeup to a lot of
shelters is that they can only accept it
new a lot of them don't have the
resources to sanitize and makeup
themselves to not gonna sit around
sanitizing all the donations the cool
thing about Project Beauty share is that
you can literally mail in a box of your
use makeup they have a group of
volunteers who go through and sanitize
everything you can donate everything
except anything with a one so lip gloss
mascara because those things you can't
sanitize and then distribute it to
shelters in Washington and they have one
in Idaho all this information is on
their website if you want to learn more
about it I'm obviously going to link it
down below but if you've been meaning to
go through your makeup now is the time
send it into Project Beauty share
include a note in there if you do saying
that you came from the Tayla talk to one
the woman on the phone from the
organization and I just really like what
their mission is and I stand behind what
they're doing I think if we can all come
together for this and either purchase a
t-shirt as your contribution or mail in
some of your makeup let's do it I'm just
so excited about this and I'm so glad I
found this and I feel like this is
something that we can all do and
participate in it also gives you some
motivation to go through and declutter
and get rid of some of your stuff
there's definitely people out there who
would appreciate it if you decide to go
through any of your makeup and donate it
tweet me tag project baby share on
Twitter alright wheat you guys I love
actually seeing the impact that we get
to make together so I'm wearing my shirt
right now you guys will have our you
seen clips of it either size medium I
feel like this fits really good I don't
like my shirts to be super tight but
fits good around the arms and it has the
nice like short sleeve or whatever you
can get it in a few different colors I
do also have men's shirt so if your guy
or if your boyfriend wants one or your
husband you never know the link for the
t-shirts will be down below
so the actual t-shirts are through
Amazon merch which is really cool
because if you have Prime you can get
Prime two day shipping I feel like
everyone knows how to shop on Amazon
I love Amazon they have great customer
service so Saturday November 5th first
day 15 days of foundation I love seeing
you guys get excited about it on Twitter
snapchat and stuff so if you're not
following me on social that's where all
the fun goes down don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you're excited
I'm excited love you guys thanks for
watching see you on Saturday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
