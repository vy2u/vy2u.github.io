flogging and literally balling tryout to
house the lashes lash blue for keeping
these bad boys on alright so today we
have a spring collective haul I have
some jewelry some perfumes some clothing
a ton of clothing swimsuits I have
a ton of trips coming up this summer
supposed to target whole asking if you
guys want to see a spring haul and a
bunch of you said yes so we are doing it
today so I'm not going in any order I
literally have a pile of stuff right
here and I'm just gonna go to town so
the first thing is the swimsuit that I
got from Zappa lures awful I saw him on
a Facebook ad and that worked and this
swimsuit is so freakin cute I got this
mainly for the top I'm not gonna be
wearing these bottoms but look at this
swim to your top I posted this on
snapchat and a bunch of you guys were
asking on my strobe livestream where I
bought this and it was from is awful I
just think this is so unique I've never
seen a swimsuit top like this it came
with these bottoms which are very
questionable I'm not really sure it did
take like four weeks to get here so just
keep that in mind if you are getting
swimsuits for an upcoming trip or
anything okay so next I wanna just get a
new perfume you guys know I'm a perfume
quarter and whole perfume collection
video if you haven't seen that now I'm
gonna try out separate because I've
heard a lot of good things about them
and spacely where you pay 15 bucks a
month for tu-95 a month and you get a
perfume and that's basically like dating
perfumes like you can try out a perfume
before you actually buy it I find that
since I have so many perfumes I rarely
go through a whole bottle just because I
like to switch it up everyday I love
roller balls I love getting smaller
sizes which is why I'm super stoked
about this you basically go on and
select like what you're feeling what
kind of notes you want they come up with
perfume recommendations so I got it
flower bomb I feel like this is like a
springy as it gets around here for
perfumes for me it smells super ambry
and like sexy but it also smells kind of
floral let's just do a quick spritz my
god smells so good so super stoked about
this I do have a 25% off coat that I'll
link in the description box down below
along with everything else I'm talking
about today I feel like this is gonna be
my new addiction because you can
literally try
a new perfume every single month what is
more exciting than that all right so
next I got some things on Shion again I
saw Facebook ad I feel like since I
searched for a bexco Cruz they all of a
sudden like thrown a bunch of cheap
swimsuits some mixed feelings on this
company they're not known for being the
best quality they are super cheap and a
lot the photos look a lot different than
the actual clothes look I'm happy with a
couple of things I got and then the
other half of the stuff was just like a
waste of money so the first thing I got
which I do really like is this swimsuit
and I wanted to try out a one-piece I
don't know I've just been feeling them
and I like this cuz it has like the
bralette cups or whatever this is called
used--yeah bustier it's all the time you
know it has this like ripping which is
really flattering pretty much all this
stuff was like under $15 think this is
just part of the design but it has these
weird darker spots right here I don't
know if you guys can see that but it has
these like weird darker spots that at
first looked like stains and pretty sure
it's just part of the design because
they're like all over I got another
swimsuit from them and these are
high-waisted bottoms I don't know how
attractive these will be on me because I
have a pretty short torso I just got it
mostly for the top that came with it but
it has these like side little things and
then it also came with this top which I
do really like and this fits really cute
goes like this and then ties around here
as well so you get something like
strappy action going on so this is just
a gray shirt I just like the color of
this this one I am happy with it is
super soft and the cool thing about this
is it has this little situation at the
bottom I thought this would just look
cute with like leggings or capris and
flats or something I got this neon pink
sweatshirt kind of shirt and it's not
even showing up as neon thats it is in
real life it's like a baby pink neon I
just thought this would be good for the
summer I am NOT someone who likes
wearing like tank tops and super showy
stuff in the spring and summer I prefer
to wear like short sleeve shirts and
baggy things that are just comfortable I
picture this with like a chunky
statement necklace and black leggings
and like flats or sneakers or something
next are a few of the questionable items
so this I wore in one of my recent
videos and it's like this yellow thing
and from far away this shirt looks good
and I do like the color but it is like
pretty hideous this material is awful
Ryan's we have like a wetsuit material
now your neoprene is like the cheap
crappy version that has this thing at
the bottom where it goes out and it just
sits way too low on my body this might
look good on someone if you're super
tall but the quality is just like pretty
shitty just keep that in mind if you're
ordering on that site
this one isn't absolutely horrible it's
a short sleeve black and white striped
why can't I think of the name of these
when they like go out at the bottom it's
one of those again it's it's a little
bit low on my waistline and the material
doesn't feel that great but I mean I can
wear this in like videos all right
Victoria's Secret so I got a few shirts
randomly here I was planning on just
getting this one shirt which I think of
worn in video when I rung it up it
literally was like $12.99 and so lady
said all the shirts that were similar to
this we're like on clearance they
weren't marked at all so it was like a
total random find so I got a few more of
these there's this one which is really
cute and then I got three yeah no two
others so there's this turquoisey one
with black writing I just love the
Victoria Secret shirt it's a really nice
quality and I like how they're just
baggy and comfortable I can wear these
with shorts in the summer or leggings or
whatever I'm pretty sure all these rung
up as like $12.99 or $17.99 and they're
normally $28 then I got this one I love
the color of this neon orange with the
palm trees I went through a neon phase
like a couple years ago and I think it's
coming back totally forgot it I got my
present so when to Nordstrom Rack
because I had to return something I got
off of hot look if you order anything
out for pot luck which is like
Nordstrom's flash sale site you can
return it in store to the North Shore
rack store it just has to say returnable
one thing so that's why I get a lot of
my shoes on a hot look even if they
don't fit I can just take it back to the
store and it's super easy so I ended up
exchanging some boots I got for these
flats which are so cute I've never been
able to find these in my size these are
like the lace-up ankle kind of flats
these are size 4 there are $39 and
they're the Nine West brand and they're
just suede and they're super nice they
also had these in black and I was
debating getting the black ones but I
have so many freaking black shoes
then I figured why not also from
Nordstrom Rack I found the murad acne
kit this was
only 1997 and I got it for 750 on
clearance which is like an insane deal
it comes with three Murad products the
clarifying cleanser acne body wash and
time release acne cleanser so I figured
if nothing else this would be good to
travel with because they're all the
small mini size and I just like getting
travel sized stuff because I would
rather try it out and see if I like it
and then purchase the full-size version
I also got this Essie nail polish this
is the shade of pressure chic who knows
it's just a silvery nail polish I saw
someone wearing a silver nail polish and
I was like ooh I want that I usually
wear shellac like right now if shellac
on my nails but sometimes in between all
paint over the shellac if I don't want
to go like getting redone so figured I
could do that with this and this is just
super metallic II and pretty and this
was 697 normally 850 so last thing I
figured I would share with you guys is
my rocks box this month because I get a
ton of questions about rocks box if I
still use it in my thoughts on it and I
do I pay for this myself I've been using
rocks box for about a year and a half
now it's basically like Netflix for
jewelry it's like 19 bucks a month and
you pay and you get three different
pieces of jewelry you can return it as
much as you want and for me that's like
the perfect situation so I'm just going
to show you quickly the three pieces
that I got this month because they're
really good ones and you can go on and
like select which ones are on your wish
list I believe of a coupon code that
gives you a free first month of rocks
box if you want to try it out so I'll
put that in the description box so the
first piece is this bracelet and I'm
definitely gonna be purchasing this one
because I love this I wear this bracelet
every single day and I feel like having
a good gold one just goes really well
with it when I want like a little extra
something something my wrist is super
small so I like how this you can adjust
it so I definitely am gonna be
purchasing this one after and basically
if you want to buy it you just don't
send it back and they charge you for it
a nice necklace which I'm also really
tempted to buy just because I feel like
I would wear this why is this piece
super pretty I like the gray the light
gray color on here and just a statement
necklace oh it's not too bold I feel
like I would wear this with a lot all
this jewelry that they have on here is
like super nice quality and then the
last necklace is a perfect example of
something that I would wear because it's
in my rocks box but I would never
purchase which is also good because if
like it makes you get out of your like
jewelry fashion comfort zone a little
bit
super pretty I like the royal blue it's
something I would wear with like this -
my bra let thing which I also get a ton
of questions about the bra let's these
are from Victoria's Secret I have a gray
one and a black one
I love these a link these down below -
because I actually I did just recently
get these - but it were the gray one in
a video and got ton of collections
about it these are super comfortable
they have like underwire padding -
anyway it's getting sidetracked I would
wear it with like just a slouchy shirt
like this and jeans so that was
everything if you guys liked this video
and you want more hauls give it a thumbs
up so I know if you're curious about
what's in my face right now it's the it
cosmetics CC cream mixed in with a
foundation Lightner the color pop choker
on the lips highlight is Mac
lightscapade
which I actually really like I feel like
I forgot about this but it just gives
you such a pretty glow eye lashes are
the more PDW lashes like always check
the description box because I like
pretty much anything you'll ever need to
know
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
