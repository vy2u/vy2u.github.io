Friday this is where I try out a new
foundation every single Friday on my
channel 6 p.m. Pacific time today we're
keeping it a little bit cached because
we're trying out a skin tint by the way
I am very aware that my lashes look very
odd right now new circle a sentence they
were like falling out I couldn't quite
tell how ridiculous they looked or I
would have put on some false lashes but
let's just focus on the foundation shall
we this is the first aid beauty hello
fab triple protection skin tint with
goji berry SPF 30 oh retails for 34
bucks this has one fluid ounce of
product $34 I feel like 34 dollars for a
skin tint like a tinted moisturizer kind
of product is a little bit pricy
products only comes in four shades the
lightest shade which is this is fair and
then the deepest shade is tan which
doesn't look very deep at all so let's
read some of the claims says it's an
ultra light breathable fluid goes onto
the skin effortlessly for simple brush
free buildable coverage this natural
pigmented formula is available in four
adaptable shades to suit a wide spectrum
of complexions I don't know about that
it's basically just supposed to help
even skin tone conceal imperfections and
create a flawless look so this for all
skin types I have normal to dry skin
right now so I'm gonna sort swatches
here so you can see with the shade fair
looks like compared to some of my other
foundations alright so swatch time right
here's the first aid beauty skin tint in
the lightest shade fair
October's Laura Geller cover lock in
porcelain NARS sheer glow in Siberia and
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 and I'm gonna be doing kind of a
workout sweat test with this one because
that's typically when I would wear a
product like this if I'm working out and
I just want something super quick to
cover up some redness or if I'm going to
run errands or something like that so
I'm gonna live my day as I normally
would with this thing and we'll see how
it holds up but if you're excited for a
foundation Friday don't forget to give
this a thumbs up if you're new here you
can join the BAE radio family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time
let's do this I've got my blanket jacket
on I've already washed moisturize and I
think I'm actually gonna prime half my
face today with the coconut skin
smoothie priming moisturizer I use this
one time I use it in
I think it was the first impressions
video our Shadowrun schmooze but I
figure this might go well together maybe
so let's prime this side of my face
typically with something like this even
if I was just running out of the door
and wanted to like slap something on my
face I do use some kind of product to
make it stay on a little bit better like
either a setting spray usually a setting
spray just because that's quicker than a
primer let's start out with this side
while the primer is soaking in does it
supposed to be buildable
it also says brushless so I'm kind of
wondering if I should try maybe this
side with just my hands because it's
supposed to be just like a light tint so
I'm gonna shake it Oh feels pretty thick
that is gonna sound a little bit more
liquidy yeah let's try it with my hands
on this side oh this definitely looks a
little bit dark I need to just put on
quite a bit of product oh I can also see
it like sitting on top of my skin weird
maybe you need to brush this one let's
try it with the brush instead I'm gonna
use the Sigma f80 and it's supposed to
build all right that seems to be now
working a little bit better cancelling
out some of the redness on my face hard
to tell on camera but it is a little bit
dark but not super noticeable because it
is so sheer I think a sponge would
totally soak all this up so this is very
share a little bit more sheer than I was
expecting it's not sitting the best on
my skin you can just like see it
chilling let's try the prime side and
see if it goes on any better I'm using a
lot of product that amount is what I've
been using on like half a quarter of my
face half of a half so I feel like I'd
probably go through that bottle pretty
quickly looking the same it just does
not want to sit on my skin I'm not ultra
dry or anything right now either
oh good I'm a zoom in I think the camera
is picking up on this like look at how
that's sitting there and around my nose
on my nose it looks horrible and then if
you try and like blend it in with your
finger it literally just rubs it away
not looking the best I'm actually gonna
try this with a sponge maybe it needs
some
moisture okay so I'm gonna go in try and
smooth this out with a sponge and build
it up a little bit it's definitely
helping still doesn't look great I'm not
trying to get more coverage at this
point I know this is very low coverage
and not expecting like high coverage or
anything I'm just trying to make it look
decent on my skin the finish of it and
I'm getting like the stamp marks do you
see that we got a smooth out this
forehead situation still does not look
good like I wouldn't put this on my face
again since we're already doing this I
kind of want to try out the number-7
concealer again I try this out as a
first impression to the radiant glow
number seven concealer and I said I
would only use this on like very natural
makeup kind of days so I want to see how
it looks with it look like this I
basically just want a little something
to like brighten up my under eyes I'm
not gonna drag it down so it doesn't
affect the foundation or anything and as
far as the prime versus not prime side I
feel like the product sat on top the
same we'll see if the prime side makes
it last any longer not really a fan of
either of these right now so right now
it's 1038 I'm gonna do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back okay so
it's only been a few minutes is 1049 so
we're gonna call it check-in time let's
just call it 10:45 I did very very very
basic makeup because like I said I'm
just gonna be working and going to the
gym today already and my gym clothes I'm
ready so I didn't have to use a powder
on this half of my face it actually felt
like it set down a bit it was easy
blending powder products on top of it so
that's good the shade is about a shade
too dark harder to tell in this lighting
I don't mind the coverage at all like I
said I want to look for something like
this that's quick and easy to apply for
just running out the door but I just
really don't like how this is sitting on
my face it's not flattering at all
I'm hoping this kind of warms up
throughout the day you can just see it
sitting on my face which is not what you
want especially for something that's
light coverage and is just like your
skin just a tiny bit better so as of
right now I'm not feeling this at all
but we'll see how it wears throughout
the day on the rest of my face all I
used was the NARS free Sol blush this is
such a pretty light pink flowy kind of
blush I feel like the highlight is the
only thing that semi saved in my face
today the cover effects moonlight
highlight holy see this is the only
highlighter I brought on my trip and it
is
so freakin beautiful I'm obsessed with
this thing and this is a travel size and
I feel like I'll probably never even go
through this whole thing and it was like
10 bucks or 12 bucks but on a flower
beauty lip liner this is petal pout nude
and then on top of it I have Mac under
the sheets lip gloss so I'll show you
guys right now what it looks like a
natural lighting and then we'll do a
little flash test so here's what my face
looks like in natural lighting right now
it's looking a lot better on camera the
finish of it yeah it looks like smooth
on camera for some reason it does not
look like that in real life let's do a
little flash test my eyelashes look so
ratchet right now it doesn't look
horrible it did give me a little bit of
white flashback though probably because
of the SPF in it so next check and IG
will be a natural lighting I'll see you
guys in a few hours so now it's 4:30 so
it's been on for about 6 hours
I'm catching like the last tiny bit of
light coming through right now so
looking a little blue got the leopard
robe on so I did work out I got a clip
right after I worked out so you guys can
see what it looks like I did feel like
it rubbed off a bit on my forehead where
I was like sweating I was doing an
elliptical so I was definitely sweating
and on my forehead it did rub off by my
hairline so I wouldn't say this is
really like workout sweat proof or
anything so even if you're wearing this
as like a skin tone on a summery day I
don't think it would hold up that well
if it was hot or humid it out right now
six hours later it's just very while
looking to me all around I also really
don't like this concealer it almost
looks like I have a powder on that's
like the kind of texture it's giving my
skin I'm gonna try and zoom in see if
you can see what I'm saying I feel like
the camera's not really picking up wow
did I get more freckles under here or
what but I'm gonna wear this a few more
hours and I'll check back in with you
guys at the end of the night know the
end of the night is 855 so it's been on
for a little over 10 hours and I washed
back some footage because I was starting
to edit this video I think I've ever
looked so ratchet
in a video these lashes have got to go
can they finish filling out please I'm
gonna be wearing false lashes and every
video here on out because I didn't
realize how messed up they look so you
don't have to tell me in the comments
I'm aware this one especially is not
looking so hot no real other thoughts
since the last check-in
I just
think it looks fluttering on the skin
whatsoever so I don't know maybe my skin
just might be too dry for this one right
now maybe with like a really dewy
setting spray underneath or something
but again my face feels just normal
today and it was moisturize really well
before I put this on so for $34 I
definitely would not recommend this one
but do let me know what kind of lighter
coverage tinted products you like for
this purpose because I want to try
tomorrow but if you guys enjoyed
foundation Friday don't forget to give
this a thumbs up next weeks foundation
Friday I'll be looking a lot more put
together I was debating not posting this
one and just trashing this totally but
this is life guys I don't look glammed
up every day and I have falling out
eyelashes looking great I love you guys
thanks for watching see on my next video
