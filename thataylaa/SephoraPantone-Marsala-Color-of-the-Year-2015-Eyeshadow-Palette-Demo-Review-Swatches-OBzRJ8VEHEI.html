of a video we're doing a quick first
impression review type of thing with an
eye look at the end what I'm wearing on
eyeballs right now you don't know how
many times I destroyed to film that
intro so Sephora came out with a Pantone
color of the Year limited edition
eyeshadow palette they have a whole
lipstick collection as well which I
haven't tried out I'm gonna have
swatches while I kind of go through and
talk about each shade it is my first
time doing swatches with this new lens
bear with me while I figure everything
out had some flowers going on in the
background birthday and trick alright so
this is what the packaging looks like
it's hard to not get a glare with this
thing so I'm just tilting it down I
really like the packaging they have this
kind of hombre thing going on which is
only the outside layer I thought that's
what the actual palette was but it's not
it so when you take it off I can get it
off this is what it looks like it is a
rose gold color I don't know if that's
showing up on camera hey there's you
guys so like I said go this into this
this palettes limited edition it's $39
bonsecours website there are 24 shades
and it is a mix of Mac satin and on
their website it says that it's a mix of
match of our pearl and glitter finishes
that complement the color of the year
there is like nothing more satisfying to
me than putting like burnt deep colors
on your eyes so as soon as I saw the
support came out this palette I was on
it so just thoughts on the packaging it
looks really gross because mine's all
dirty but when you're just looking at it
it looks really nice and sleek it is
pretty thin it is pretty tiny if you can
see the packaging doesn't feel cheap to
me like it feels like it's a sturdy
pallet that I could take with me
wherever I want to take it the inside
packaging could be a little more
appealing this is pretty flimsy the
inside like I can press down on this
white thing yes is definitely like super
plasticy the rest of the casing is
beautiful and it doesn't feel cheap it
has a super nice huge ass mirror so this
is kind of a glimpse of what all of the
shadows look like I have been using two
of these shades pretty much every single
day this week for work there's a really
really nice crease color in here that's
not like too much also the lightest
shade which I didn't think I was gonna
like at all
it's like matte but it has some glitter
flecks in it I don't like wearing
shimmering for work at all I think
it's just like too much but I do like a
little something something you know what
I mean
like this shade is like the perfect
combo of that it gives me a little bit
of glitter but it doesn't look like I'm
like kicking on the glitter so before I
walk through each shade I'm kind of
obsessed with this palette it's
basically like all of the warm matte and
shimmery shades that I've ever wanted
into one palette I would say like
two-thirds of these shades completely
wowed me
there's some that just like aren't quite
there but the other shades make it worth
it to me there's some really nice
buttering mattes in here there's some
great shimmer if you like warm tones I
think you definitely need to get your
hands on this if you can last time I
checked it was out of stock I can't
imagine them not not adding more since
it is so popular okay so I kind of
already talked about the first shade
let's go on to the next few so the
second shade over is a really nice kind
of warm kamilly tan color it is a matte
I really like how on the back of this
palette they tell you every single shade
name and the finish of it the next one
over is the marsala color so marsala is
the color of the year it's like a burnt
red color this is a matte shade they
also have the next one over which is
marsala Sutton these looked pretty
freakin similar to me both of them have
a nice finish the satin one doesn't
really look like a satin to me they both
look pretty frickin mess the next shade
over is this like silvery taupe color
and it reminds me exactly a verb from
The Naked 2 palette which is like one of
my all-time favorite eye shadows super
nice color I'm wearing it on my inner
corner right now what you guys
see you in a second Shane after that is
like the most buttery matte brown shade
ever this is a pretty warm tone Brown
the shade after that is definitely more
full tone both of these are super
buttery super pigmented I really like
these two shades especially for being
Matt they just have a really nice
consistency following shaded is a cool
toned deep gray color I would say and a
great taupe yeah then we have two
cranberry shades both of these are
absolutely gorgeous the first one is
definitely more of a shimmer and the
next one definitely has some glitter in
it my only criticism with this palette
is I feel like there's kind of three
sets of two colors that are almost too
similar don't think they should have
added more glitter to this or just done
something different because I feel like
a few of these shades are like very very
similar card just couple and had to
start over again all right where were we
some there's two green shades in here
first one is a little bit on the chalky
side I wouldn't call it chalky but it's
like definitely leaning towards the
truck enos the second one is just a
really pretty emerald color no
complaints there
both of these gold shades are gorgeous
the first one is definitely a little bit
lighter the second one is more of like a
bronzy gold both of them are again
amazing I'm like all about these gold
shades in here then we have two matte
shades the first one is what I've been
using every single day on my crease have
it on my crease right now I think this
is the perfect perfect crease color it's
not too warm it's not too cool the
second one over is a burnt kind of
orange e rust color gnarly rust what
would you call this or do brown the
silver I was a little bit disappointed
by definitely not as smooth and
shimmering I feel like as it could be a
little bit on the trockie side blue on
the other hand is really pretty if we're
gonna put glitter in the shadow I feel
like this blue one has the perfect
amount the next shade is such a pretty
matte color feels like butter super
pigmented feels
it'd be super easy to blend out the next
one over I almost wish I used on my
bottom lashline today because it is
pretty dark it doesn't look to me like
that dark in the pan but it comes off
pretty freakin dark I wish they did this
exact shade but without glitter not
really a fan of the glitter next two
shades are like no words these are
beautiful mattes buttery pigmented no
complaints the next one is this gorgeous
kind of like reflective emerald color
definitely some purple undertones in
there wearing it on my lid right now
super pigmented gorgeous the next one
reminds me of black part in The Naked 3
palette almost looks like there's some
red or pink glitter in there so that's
just a quick overview of all the shadows
in this palette I personally love this
palette I think that if you like warm
tones you will love this palette if you
don't like warm tones do not buy the
salad do you want to say that I was very
very pleasantly surprised with the
consistency of the ones that I used on
my eyes today not just like the
pigmentation but the way they blended
out was just the perfect amount to me
sometimes I feel like especially with
these dark shades you can easily over
blend these were like the perfect amount
of being able to blend but being able to
also not over blend I'm super happy with
the ones that I wore today and I'm
excited to experiment with the other
ones let me know if you guys want to see
other looks using this palette or just
Instagram post or something let me know
if you want to see what is on my
eyeballs right now and how I created
this look using this palette then just
keep watching
I have so much blush and bronzer on that
I couldn't even walk outside right now
it looks like nothing with this ring
light is my first like makeup kind of
video with my new lens and everything so
I'm gonna try my best to stay completely
in focus if I move an inch
I'm out of focus no idea what we're
doing with this thing but I'm super
excited to use it so it clearly already
done my face all the face makeup I used
will be listed down below I just wanted
this video to like focus on the palette
and on the eyes so I've already primed
my eyes with Mac's painterly paint-pot
this is one of my favorite primers to
use I'm kind of going back to it I
didn't use it for a while I feeling it
again so I'm gonna go in with that light
tan crease color and I'm using my Sedona
lace evening 13 brush this is my
favorite flip it's my favorite brush oh
there's a nice frickin mirror on here
I'm use this thing this is like the
perfect
crease blending brush kind of thing I'm
just kind of blending this everywhere up
to our brow boom I'm so - I wanna show
you in a while it feels kind of weird it
is Saturday right now the Seahawks game
is on officially the worst Washingtonian
ever and we're going to use some greens
yeah let's do it
so I'm gonna start off with this super
deep oh my god this looks so amazing I
think I'm just dinner yet let's just put
this all over the lid brush I'm using
for this is the morphe something brush
useful all the brushes and everything
are always listed down below this
reminds me exactly of my favorite shade
in the revealed 2 palette I'm just gonna
kind of turn that brush sideways and
just blend a little bit into the crease
really like that shade for being pretty
powdery when you first put your brush in
I haven't had any fallout yet look how
freakin pretty this is this looks like
it has some like purpley undertones to
it so I feel like a go good with this
shade we have going on oh my god
you see this I feel like a peacock yeah
I'm just keeping this mostly on the
center of my I can't see normally I
would add kind of like another color on
the outer corner but I kind of just want
to leave it like this feel like it might
look really good with some falsies I'm
gonna go back in with this brush and
blend that first transition color on the
bottom lashline we're probably gonna
have some of that dark purplish neon
here too a little bit of fallout nothing
crazy I'm consciously trying to keep my
mouth closed right now I'm gonna take a
tiny tiny bit of this like burnt orange
color like literally the tiny spit ever
and we're just gonna put this up here
and see what happens so kind of warm up
the crease a little bit I think I want
to put my eyeliner on before I do the
bottom lash line just because that way
you can kind of connect your liner with
the bottom lash line you probably guess
which eyeliner I'm going to use it not
you should go watch more of my videos so
I'm using the Physicians Formula i
booster eyeliner make sure you get ultra
black not just black because this one is
amazing actually let's do an inner
corner thing first gonna take these
Sedona lace 904 brush I've been obsessed
with this brush is good for the inner
corner and for the bottom lash line
super soft a lot softer than my Sedona
or Sigma
pencil brush and we're just loading that
up in the inner corner now you're gonna
go in with eyeliner if you like to start
by just drawing that base on both sides
and then I'll go in and do a wing I like
to bring it out far enough where I can
connect something to the bottom lash
line here did you over draw it and this
makes it look like your eyes are
actually bigger than PR there's no real
dark shade in here like for the bottom
lash line what are we gonna do
black alright so I'm treating going in
with a black eyeshadow this is roulette
by colour-pop cosmetics haven't used
this before looks just like a matte
black oh yeah like I could go either way
right now with eyeliner on the waterline
or just keeping the waterline blank
since I'm going to use kind of dull like
lashes I'm just gonna put motorcycle I'm
just gonna go in with a white eyeliner
cuz I kind of just want to keep
everything open this is just a white
eyeliner by NARS that I got up and blam
bought this alright so then I'm gonna go
in with false lashes I'm used the red
cherry
1:03 I cut these a lot like how long the
band is but also just like I just went
in and kind of trimmed them up these are
super super long and I have weird eyes
like if mine are too long they literally
go up to my eyebrow giving a little
haircut I'm just gonna apply these
really quick with my Ardell no duo lash
looking so fresh not loose my favourite
glue and get off of I can't house for
really cheap first I'm gonna go in with
a super quick coat of L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black mascara this is usually the
one that I use when I wear falsies just
because the eyes are done really likely
in the red cherry or 1:03 lashes I just
think they're like the perfect amount
like separation and length and
everything for me right now
on the lips I'm feeling kind of like a
deep whiney red color I'm gonna go in
with the Palladio or bow liner in black
berry you can get these at Sally beauty
and they are pretty cheap and they're
just like a few bucks I'm just gonna
leave the middle kind of blank then
we're gonna go in with Maybelline's 695
divine wine this is one of their new
matte lipsticks haven't tried any of
them yet
I love having a lip ring all right so
this is the final look if you guys liked
