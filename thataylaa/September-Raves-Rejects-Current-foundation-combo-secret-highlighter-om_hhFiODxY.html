right now I thought I was just playing
with makeup and then this happened and
now we're here if you want to see the
makeup details feel like I'm wearing
right now it's all on Instagram so I
didn't film a raisin Rejects video last
night just as I didn't have that many
products that I was feeling that month
and I'd rather just not do a favorites
video than have products that I like
half-assed kind of like all the products
I mentioned in my race and rejects
videos are products that I absolutely
love trying out the middle part right
now I'm not sure how I feel about it I
have been mentally preparing for the
fall for like two months now so I'm
ready let's do this might start playing
the Christmas music next week I just
feel like it always comes too fast and
then everything's over why not start in
September anyways so I'm just gonna be
talking about makeup and beauty and hair
stuff in this video I think I'm gonna do
a whole other favorites video for like
home and random stuff because I have a
lot of stuff that I want to talk about
but it isn't makeup let's start out with
my favorite foundation combo this month
which is the l'oreal which is the
lancome tint idol ultra 24 hour makeup
they just came out with the shade it's
zero nine zero ivory and this is the
lightest shade that they make and it
actually is fair enough i'm not a fan of
this foundation by itself just because i
don't like the super super matte finish
by itself this foundation is a little
bit too matte for my liking and it also
just doesn't have enough coverage okay
this is a medium coverage like a
buildable medium coverage i haven't been
able to get it to completely full
coverage you can still see my acne
scarring peeking through and my skin is
freakin horrible right now cuz i started
using the Clarisonic everyone keeps
snapping me giving me words of
encouragement to keep using it and that
this is like a temporary thing just
sucks cuz my skin has finally been clear
and then i started using it but we're
gonna persevere we're using the
Clarisonic anyways what were we talking
about
i've tried putting taut should do a skin
mist underneath which was okay it still
wasn't like perfect and then what I
started doing was applying the Lumina
bright now vitamin C day cream this
actually makes your skin super freakin
dewy like more so than the talkshow
stuff if you put this moisturizer on
before your makeup and just let it sit
for 10 minutes and then put on your
primer and apply your foundation you are
freaky and glowy I wasn't a matter I
heard you dying I really like this stuff
I'm not
it as a rave in this video because I've
only been trying it out for a couple
weeks I do really like it it smells like
a lemon tree so I go in with that stuff
and then what I do is mix this
foundation with the cover effects drops
is this the custom cover drops and
basically it's a straight-up pigment so
you can just put a couple of drops in a
foundation to give it a little bit more
coverage you can mix it in with a
moisturizer a BB cream a primer or
whatever your heart desires
go for it I'm in the shade n 10 in these
and this mixed together with this
foundation is just perfection I feel
like it gives a perfect amount of
coverage my skin looks flawless the
finish with that lumen a cream is
beautiful and it works great I haven't
done a full review on these things so
let me know down below if you guys would
want to see that alright next up is the
Milani single eye shadow in Bella
chiffon this is an eye shadow but if you
have pale skin this is a perfect
highlight for your cheekbones I'm
actually wearing it right now and I
freaking love it it has a perfect white
gold ish kind of highlight it doesn't
look like a chalky eyeshadow it blends
out super nice put this on your inner
corner and it'll just make your eyes pop
I really love the shade of this and it
just works really well if you appeal
skip next I have another Milani product
this is the more matte lip cream in the
shade embrace if you follow me on
Instagram or snapchat you know I went on
a frickin manhunt to find these these
lip creams are limited edition and
they're literally sold out everywhere
they restock them online and they sold
out in like 20 minutes the only two
shades I've been able to get my hands on
is embrace and what is this the door
which I like but it's not like I don't
know the colors a little bit off for my
skin tone it's like to oranjee this
color is freakin beautiful I posted a
picture on Instagram and whole tutorial
using this product so I'll link it down
below it is just the most beautiful deep
berry color with like the perfect amount
of vamp enos where it's still wearable I
really like the formula of these to me
they don't feel nearly as drying as the
colour-pop liquid matte lipsticks it
smells like cake which is always a bonus
they dry fairly fast and they are
long-lasting which I always look for in
a liquid lipstick people have been
snapping me that they found these you
might be able to still get your hands on
these they thought to be ever in your
favor
next we have a lotion this is
why train boutique collection shea
butter body lotion this is actually from
Dollar Tree I'm not usually attracted to
shea butter smells but I don't know why
I decided smell listen Dollar Tree I
smells almost identical to the soap &amp;amp;
Glory body butter which is strange this
doesn't smell anything like shea butter
usually does it smells super like soapy
and fresh a little bit of this goes a
super a long way it's moisturizing for a
dollar you can't go wrong next I have
these three brushes which I believe I
got on eBay it might have been Amazon
I'll link it down below but I think this
was like a dollar fifty total shipped
and these are actually really nice
brushes you can actually find some
really good cheap brushes on eBay
they're obviously not the same quality
as like Sedona lace or Sigma but they do
have really affordable brushes I'm
trying to order a bunch of them to try
out for you guys so I can do a like
affordable makeup brush video this
angled one I've been using to either put
in the crease or also blend out
concealer under eye concealer and it
actually is really nice I've never liked
using a brush to blend out my under eye
concealer but this one actually does a
really nice job and it doesn't leave any
kind of streaks or anything so it's also
really nice for blending out in the
crease and it looks like it would be too
big for that but it's um how it works
this pointy one is a little bit more
firm this is like my least favorite out
of the three but I used it today to
blend black in the corner of my eye and
it's doable it's not my favorite brush
in the world these two make it worth it
I feel like for the prices are just good
multi-use kind of brushes you could also
use this to apply a highlight or on your
nose what is this in Cupid's bow next is
the dr. Bronner's all-in-one hemp citrus
here at castile Castile I got this from
Ross or no TJ Maxx for 399 and it's
normally six dollars I feel like I've
been hearing people on YouTube talk
about this for years I don't know why I
just now decided to try it out I know
they make a eucalyptus one which I also
want to try basically this is the best
brush cleaner I've ever used in my life
I have a whole video on a DIY brush
cleaner but I usually just mix olive oil
with dish soap this does just as good of
a job just so easy I literally just wet
the bar of soap and rub my brush in it
and it takes everything out if you're in
need of a good brush cleaner try this
stuff out next up is the makeup
revolution sugar and spice ultra blush
palette and I mentioned the
in my Ulta haul which I'll link down
below this just comes with eight
different blushes or I guess six blushes
and like to kind of highlight shades
right here every single day I've been
using this shade and then putting a
little bit of this light pink one over
top this gives the prettiest sheen to
your cheeks where it doesn't look like a
highlight but you can just it just looks
kind of like reflective all these are
beautiful they blend out nicely they're
super pigmented you can get makeup
revolution at Ulta now and it's super
reasonably priced they have a lot of
great products try them out if you
haven't already and this is a good one
to start with a couple more things the
first is Smith's this is even called
menthol and eucalyptus balm and this is
basically you know that like jar tin
thing of rose balm that everyone loves
this is the same thing just eucalyptus
scented and in a tube I hate digging my
fingers into those things to apply at
night I just feel like this is so much
easier this smells so good it leaves
your lips feeling like the good kind of
tingle and it's just super moisturizing
I haven't had chapped lips at all since
I've started using this last part they
want to mention is the color pop
eyeshadow and this is in the shade iSpy
I believe this is part of the back to
cool or school or whatever collection
that's out right now I hope they're
still selling this I don't know if this
is like limited edition it's basically
just this light orange kind of shade
it's darker than Peach Smoothie but when
you blend it out in your crease it looks
a lot lighter
I've just been wearing this with why
can't I think of the word right now
mascara towards colors just perfect for
the crease you can use it with almost
any look wearing it in the crease right
now $5 got a love color pop alright so
that was everything let me know down
below if you guys want to see a other
like random favorites kind of video if
you guys like this and you like raves
and rejects videos give it a thumbs up
so I know
oh rejects I guess I didn't have
any rejects this month I feel like I did
I just always forget where I put them
alright so my only reject this month was
the Anastasia Beverly Hills highlight I
posted about this on Instagram but I was
actually really disappointed in this
product I'm not quite sure what all the
hype is about but for me it was super
dry chalky feeling it didn't blend out
well it literally disappeared on my face
people suggested that if you wet your
brush it looks better but I just don't
feel like you should have to do that
with a $30 highlight so I ended up
returning mine to Macy's and yeah
is my raison reject for September if you
guys like this video give it a thumbs up
so I know love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
