it's the best thing that's happened to
me or the worst thing that's happened to
me my coffee addiction is on a whole new
level alright so today we have sep
tember raves and rejects yes it's the
middle of October it feels like it
should be the middle of July right now I
think this is where the delay and raves
and rejects videos is coming from but
who knows so this month I have all
makeup products ninety-nine percent
makeup products let's just jump into it
because why not so for foundation and my
favorite face products this month have
been revlon colorstay applied with a
Sigma f80 kabuki brush topped with the
two-faced cocoa powder foundation of a
whole review and demo on this product
this is awesome if you want to hear my
thoughts on it you can click the video
over here and it will open in a window I
kind of stopped using the Revlon
Colorstay because I felt like it looked
a little bit heavy on my face and when I
didn't want a full coverage face I just
didn't reach for it I found that the
trick to using this stuff is just
dabbing a little bit on your face
blending it in and then if you need more
apply more if you do want more flawless
finish at the two-faced cocoa powder
foundation on top it's what I'm wearing
right now and it will cover everything
the combo of these two products together
literally last all day I don't get oily
it's been like my fav this month for
eyebrows I've been kind of into trying
out black products for my eyebrows I
don't know if you noticed but my hair is
black and I don't know why i never
really reached for black eye brow
products i just felt like it might look
a little bit harsh i love pickles
convinced me if you don't know who imma
pickles is been living under a rock but
i will link her channel blow she also
has fair skin and dark hair and she just
goes for it with the brows like she uses
black products on her brows and she
rocks it and it looks amazing so i kind
of want to try that out i haven't been
going for a superbowl brow on an
everyday basis basically what i've been
doing is using if i can open it black
out from the Naked 2 palette my hair is
completely broken so don't mind
but I've just been going in with
blackout which is just a matte black
eyeshadow I've been using the wax from
the brow bar to go by whitening
lightning which is right here if you
just apply that first and then going
with blackout makes it look so much
better than an eyeshadow on its own this
is kind of what I've been doing more of
like a natural brow but they are a
little bit darker I do have a coupon
code for this product if you want to try
this out I also love this just because
as you can see I used this middle shade
pretty much every day in my crease I
think I just hit pan on it did I yes two
and one actually don't have that many
products and I'm like powering through
them right now slow it down to it so
I've been all about the skincare lately
I think it's just because I'm on a
mission to get rid of this acne for good
I was using a moisturizer under my
foundation that I wasn't really happy
with I just didn't like it you know
those products that there's nothing like
specifically wrong with it but there was
nothing right about it either so I've
been kind of obsessed with the tea tree
line by the body shop I tried their face
mask and ever since then I've been
hooked I ordered the moisturizer their
face wash and I use the face mask like
every other day I love tea tree if you
don't like the smell of like super minty
strong teacher he smell then you
wouldn't like this this is the tea tree
skin clearing lotion it says that it's
suitable for blemish skin shine control
for clear looking skin I really love
this for applying under foundation
because it doesn't leave a greasy
residue at all is literally like a gel
it's not like any other face lotion I've
used if you can see that it's literally
a gel and it just absorbed super nicely
into your skin a super lightweight and
it's perfect if you're looking for a
good moisturizer after your foundation I
get this stuff off of Amazon because it
is cheaper and I get free shipping I
believe down below where you can get 30
day free trial if Amazon Prime you get
free shipping or if your student you can
also get free shipping for like the rest
of the year I still use my dot edu
address even though I'm not a student
don't tell anyone so if you get this on
Amazon you can get it
super then at the body shop and they
loved it then I have the NYX lip liner
in 831 mom I'm a whole kylie jenner lip
tutorial for fair skin where's my voice
going I don't know I use this product
you can use it how I show you the video
or you can just use it by itself also
watch it for you guys super nice matte
mauve color you can just use this like I
said by itself and it makes you look
like you have a really nice matte lip
going on some people are asking why it
was necessary to do a lip tutorial for
fair skin lip colors look different on
every one skin tone something that looks
nude on someone with tan skin can look
straight up brown on us pale girls
that's why also like I have fair skin
like what the other kind of story
would I do anyways anyway next product I
think I mentioned this in my fall haul
video I can't remember this is the amber
Sparkle exfoliating butter scrub this is
from Ulta it's their brand which like
you wouldn't know because look at this
packaging classy ass packaging I really
like the whole hombre thing they have
going on here as you can see I used a
 ton of this this month this smells
so good I think I want to go back and
get some of their other stuff from this
line because it literally smells like it
doesn't really smell like amber to me it
definitely has a little muss going on
but it smells pretty sweet too this is
like my last step in the shower I'll
just put this on like on my chest and
then all my arms and just exfoliate it
leaves a really nice moisturize feel it
kind of feels like you just put lotion
on like right when you get out of the
shower in your body still kind of wet it
leaves your skin smelling so good and
feels super moisturized and it's totally
worth the price I think this was like
sixteen dollars or seventeen dollars
which I thought was kind of pricey for
olda totally worth it and I would
definitely repurchase it alright so the
last rave of the month is this guess
perfume I think this is guess seductive
yes my best friend got this from me for
my birthday because we were in fred
meyer spring perfumes and this one was
freaking amazing this smells so classy
you guys
classy working woman combined with fall
you know I mean it definitely isn't a
perfume that I would wear if I was like
going to the club this is more of like a
work perfume to me I think it smells so
good if you like the musky sense than
you would like this I think they have
this on the like discount perfume site
it's only the links down below if they
do think Ray's just got this efrain
where that is everything I feel like
that was super fast if you guys like
this video and you like ribs and rejects
videos give it a thumbs up so I know I
do have the pin up tutorial coming I
have a date for it it's happening
there's been a lot of planning this had
to happen on my end so that's why he's
taking forever but it is coming I am
going to be doing other halloween
tutorials i think if you want those
comment down below which ones you're
thinking life has been kind of insanely
busy lately whenever i do filming it's
either if i go into the office late like
I am right now or it's on the weekend
when I have to film three videos and
edit three videos on my days off so
that's kind of what's happening in the
YouTube world for me youtube is super
important to me and this is my second
job now I'm so thankful for all of you
that watch I wish I had all the time in
the world to do this but you got to work
with what you got that's what's been
going on in my world just felt like I
had to update you guys love you guys
thanks for watching see you in my next
