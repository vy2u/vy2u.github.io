a shadow and schmooze on this look
definitely not like very springy or
summery look I don't know how we ended
up here have a lot to catch you guys up
on in this video so here we go
if you're excited for this video and you
enjoy shadow and schmooze is don't
forget to give it a thumbs up I just did
a really early thumbs up there I was
ready I put every Monday Wednesday
Friday 6 p.m. Pacific time I also have a
cold shadow and schmooze playlist so if
you want to go back and watch other
shadow in schmoozers you can but these
are basically just where we talk about
anything and put on makeup so here we go
shadow in schmooze time I've got the
copy for a minute this thing I've always
looked at these and like never really
knew what to do with them but it
actually feels so good Garnier sent one
of these MPR I think you're technically
supposed to like lift and roll up but it
just feels really good if you have like
tight muscles right here if you clench
or anything when you sleep like this
feels damn good I'm just gonna use it as
a massager I'm gonna start out with this
Pacifica crystal power hydro mist I've
only used this one other time oh god
that one in my ear this is one of those
hollow wide misters kind of smells like
a starburst or something wanted to whip
out and try again the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation the shades no
because I haven't used this in a long
time I don't know if I need to mix in a
little bit of porcelain or if this is
gonna be my shade and I'm also trying
out this button which I'm super excited
try this is the Ecotools perfecting
cushion blender I think this was on
clearance or something on Ulta that's
why I picked it up think I'm gonna mix
in just a dab of porcelain which is not
porcelain at all one of my favorite
foundations a peach perfect one by Too
Faced they actually just launched or I
don't know if it's a recent but I just
saw it on Sephora they came out with a
new light shade so I just ordered it ok
just kidding I think I'm just snow
ok where to start off we're gonna start
off on blows and then end on the highs
I'm filming this a couple weeks or
probably like a week and a half before
you guys are seeing it and in my time
this week has been a little bit rough
not the best week so my grandma passed
away a couple days ago right we're gonna
keep together in this video it wasn't
very expected at all I talked to her the
day before she had a lot of pain from
just a lot of other stuff going on with
her body but
of us really thought that she was gonna
pass away yet I mean I thought she had
at least another like year my dad saw
her that same day just a couple hours
before Wow is this eyelash glue so it
was just kind of totally out of the blue
she was eating dinner
she was actually eating steak and my
grandpa passed away the same week seven
years ago and he was eating lobster and
they loved surf and turf so my whole
family's just been saying they're up
there eatin surf and turf together now
but we're just glad that it was quick
and painless for her it was just a
little bit out of the blue really glad
I'd talked to her the day before that
happened and then actually that same
night like within the hour that I found
out my best friend had to go to the ER
so I went to the ER with her and she's
totally fine now but it was just like a
lot going on in the same night and then
on top of all that I've just had a
shit-shit health pretty much week and a
half like since my mom and other grandma
came to visit which we'll talk about
after but it's been almost every day
like not functioning I'm gonna try out
this concealer again that I tried in the
green beauty video I want to try it with
my normal powders to see how it does
with that cuz I didn't totally hate this
concealer when I tried it pain level the
past a week has been like up here I've
been getting maybe an hour to of relief
like every three days and that's what
I'm in right now but I can like feel it
coming back so yeah it's been a week I'm
just hoping that my pain goes down
because I have a lot of stuff pre-filmed
which is why whenever I go through downs
like this you guys don't usually see it
because I just have stuff pre-filmed
ready to go because this is a pretty
regular thing that I'm like starting to
run low on pre filmstock have a lot of
trips coming up and then people visiting
here again it's just always so
frustrating when you could be getting so
much done that you can't physically but
anyways glad I'm having a little bit of
time right now that I feel good enough
to get on camera a little bit I really
like the tone of this concealer it has a
little bit of like salmon in there when
you use my normal powders just set my
under eyes right now it is like crease
I'm pretty easy May I'm beginning of
June I just committed to a lot of stuff
like almost over committed myself and so
I'm trying
to like follow through with all that and
still make it all happen so it's kind of
just been a total roller coaster because
the week before this week was amazing it
was like one of the best weeks I've had
in a while a lot of stuff happened and
something really exciting which you guys
will be seeing soon but on top of all
this I'm moving I'll explain more in
another video but going through that
process right now starting to basically
like pack everything up and deal with
the move and everything because in the
next month between people visiting and
then being gone I basically have like
seven days about to get all my
together to move and pre film and get
work done and just hope that I'm like
functioning those seven days so the
stress is probably not helping the
health situation right now not much you
can do you know so the one-dollar brow
gel that discovered in that video I've
been using almost every day it's
actually like ran out really quick
though so it's just a heads up if you
try it and the wand is pretty scratchy
but I love the shade of this you're kind
of like exfoliating your brows when you
put it on this is probably the most
exciting move I've ever done basically
all this happened when my mom and
grandma were here in Seattle which made
it extra exciting my other grandma from
North Carolina came to visit and my mom
and we just had such a good week and it
was the first time in a long time that I
really did not work like I got
everything done before they came so I
only had to do stuff a couple times
throughout the week so it's just like a
really nice break to just completely for
the most part stay off of social media I
was just hanging out with my family it
was like 70 degrees and sunny the whole
time they were there and I don't think
my mom's ever seen Seattle like that I
feel like every time she comes it's like
 whether we did a lot well they were
there we went to the Shania Twain
concert which was in Tacoma which was
freakin amazing one of my like best
memories with the North Carolina grandma
was when I was younger I would stay with
them and they had this like red
convertible and we would drive around
with the top off and they would just be
like blasting Shania Twain so it was
really cool to be able to take her to
that concert and Shania Twain was
freaking amazing I didn't realize it but
I guess this tour and Seattle was like
the very first stop on her tour in years
it's like she hasn't performed for how
long time and she was good like she
still had it
it's just one of his concerts that was
like super good group of people around
us did some man I feel like a woman up
in there
good time everyone was dancing it was
just like overall ten out of ten what
else did we do now I can t remember we
did so much they had the cutest Airbnb
and they had like a hot tub out there
Airbnb so the first night we just like
got wine and cheese and like good food
and just hung out in the hot tub of
course did like downtown and Pike Place
and all that and I actually met a bunch
of you guys downtown which is really fun
I never really go downtown but I met a
few of you guys that day so it's really
fun still addicted to Starbucks nitro
sweet cream I haven't tried the bronzer
shade and the Too Faced natural face
palette yet I'm gonna go in with sunny
honey right here it smells like really
good sunscreen to me what else did we do
oh we went on the hot tub boat which you
guys kind of saw parts of in the
foundation Friday did that go up yet
yeah by the way I didn't set this part
of my face because feels like the two
faces and to stack use wide up keeps
saying stack iam videos so that's like
done time sticky tacky I wanted to go to
the Skagit Valley say cold sky at Valley
yeah ask Agra Valley tulip festival
thing the tulips
but I'm pretty sure they're all dead now
I got a new shade of my favorite Scottie
London blush the glowed - blush just
ones in date night and it looks very
pretty
excited to try this not love in this
foundation on me right now so some of
you guys have been asking about Snoopy
so if you have no idea who Snoopy is he
was my foster dog my first one
and he actually got adopted the day that
I posted the meet Snoopy blog so if you
want to see him you can check out that
vlog but he got adopted that day and it
just happened so quick like I was not
mentally prepared for some reason in my
mind I thought that the parents would
have to go through like a whole process
and I would like take a couple days to
get approved I don't know why I thought
you had to get like approved like you
would for a child adoption not the same
you literally just sign the papers and
get the dog the same day so I brought
Snoopy to the shelter to meet her
instantly I was so happy that that was
who was gonna adopt him because she's a
special ed teacher she actually had a
blind dog in the past knew he was blind
and deaf so I felt really good about who
he was going to it just did not make the
process any easier I don't think I've
cried that hard since like I broke up
with my last boyfriend
honestly it was actually so sad for like
a few days whenever I have a major
crisis like that I always put on Modern
Family because for some reason Modern
Family always just puts you in the best
mood definitely got like totally
emotionally attached to him most foster
dogs at the shelter you only have for a
few days so I'm hoping next time it'll
be easier but I think since I had him
for a couple weeks and he was just like
so dependent on me and he was like my
little shadow like he literally just
followed me everywhere and I work from
home so we were just with each other
like 24/7 so to go from that for a few
weeks to nothing was just like a change
obviously I'm super happy that Snoopy
got adopted and he's in his new home and
everything I feel like he'll just always
have a little place in my heart I'm
trying out this laura mercier devotion
face highlighter
look at that him print that's so pretty
I wanted to email his new mom like the
next day to check on him but I held off
for a week and then I emailed her to get
an update and she sent me a picture so
pop him in here he looked so happy and
she loves him so it's all good I just
missed the little guy but I am gonna get
another foster dog you know a bunch of
you guys were asking me that I
definitely am like I said I just have a
ton of trips and stuff coming up so I'm
waiting until I have a kind of free time
period again to do it okay we need to
talk about some happy things so what's
coming up so in
this might be totally too dark but I
kind of want to mix in a little bit of
this shade which is indiscretion
kind of want like a warmer bronze ooh
that's pretty
I'm kind of bringing it lower than that
pink since it is darker I just want to
add a glow but it is a bit dark if I
were to use it as like my high point
highlighter so I'm kind of waiting to
hear about one trip might be going to
New York soon might not be but if not my
next trip after that is Chicago for my
birthday with my parents so we're going
to Chicago June 10th around there
something like that super excited I
freaking love Chicago as you guys know
don't know if I'm gonna be doing a
meet-up I will try to for like in an
area for a while I'll just probably
tweet and say where we are if you guys
want to come it's not gonna be like an
official meetup or anything is a trip
with my family but if we have time I'll
definitely tweet and say where we are
just oh that was pigmented I'm using the
hoodie Beauty coral obsessions pellet I
love these little mini palettes so nice
to travel with oh I was wondering why
the mirror was so foggy looking so sad
thing but if you guys are in Chicago
definitely comment down below with any
recommendations for food or things we
have to see or whatever always like
going on vacations with my parents
because my mom plans usually I'm the
planner like any time I go in a trip
with friends I'm the one who plans
everything I was in Chicago a couple
years ago for work and back then I was
working at a company and we rented a car
and we're kind of just like scoping out
certain areas for stuff I've actually
seen a lot of the Chicago neighborhoods
it is huge is it kind of renting in
Seattle but unlike a bigger scale just
because of how many different like
neighborhoods there are in different
vibes in each neighborhood and stuff
this yellow I need in my life right now
I don't know if I want to put this kind
of in the crease yeah I'm gonna try it
in the crease I might actually put it
all over my lid too but let's see I love
a good yellow I have no idea what look
I'm going for here do I ever I don't
think I've ever had a video where I
actually made what I like I was doing
before I started so I'm so happy that
you guys really enjoyed the Amazon
must-haves video I'm definitely gonna do
another one with my travel essentials
you guys said that you did want to see
that so that will be coming up soon here
I love making those kind of videos I
want to start doing kind of more
lifestyle things I have always just kind
of posted
whatever the heck I am feeling and want
to own my channel because I just I don't
understand like just sticking to one
thing because I feel like as a viewer
myself too if someone posts a video
that's like different than their normal
content or not something that I want to
see I just don't click on it I also
subscribe to people more for their
personality so even if it is a beauty
channel or if it's a daily vlogger and
they're doing a video about makeup or
whatever I usually still watch it
because I'm interested in them like as a
person yeah I do want to start doing
more travel stuff and more random things
because I have other interests besides
makeup shocking I'm gonna take this
bronzy shade right here oh that was soft
and just press that on the lid darkest
Brown in here is this one right here so
we're gonna use it I'm gonna just add a
tiny bit of the yellow back into the
crease which one of these do I want to
take I'm gonna take star light right
here technically a face highlight but
I'm gonna use my finger and put that
right on the center that just turned
into like straight-up pink that's cool
I'm also gonna use satin sheets as a
brow bone highlight I'm gonna take the
yellow shade and just blend that down my
lower lash line I'm gonna go back with
that kind of brick shade on the flat
edged brush and blend that out I'm gonna
spray with my usual hangover at three
and one makes your foundation look more
like skin and it makes her highlight pop
and everything just gives you like a
glow oh if you're in Seattle if you live
in Seattle I finally found a good
Italian place I feel like there's
certain types of food in Seattle that
there's well actually a lot of food
Seattle doesn't have very good food
we've talked about this but Italian food
was one of those things that I had only
found like a couple places that were
okay I hadn't found an Italian place in
Seattle that was like amazed balls yet
and when my mom and grandma were here we
went to this place in Ballard called San
crap what's it called sands and
something I'll pop it on the screen
right here super cute atmosphere I feel
like even if you're visiting Seattle and
you like Italian food it'd be a good
place to go if you want kind of like a
cute atmosphere and nice it's a really
good kind of date spot too it's like in
a little house and then they also have
an outside patio with like cute lights
outside but the pasta we got was it was
pretty good and the atmosphere 10 out of
10 whoa that way
she's got really intense like seriously
what just happened
alleges happen all right I'm gonna need
a real dramatic lashes for these wings
me use my eye lure 121 because these are
kind of more like cat eye someone needs
to make an eyelash stand that will hold
your lashes well they dry because I go
key right now kind of want to do like a
super vampy lip today alright so when I
add glitter to this look I don't know
just feel like we need some glitter in
life right now this is the cat Kelly
wait what oh cackles Wow oh that's
lovely I think I want to put it like all
down my lower lash line actually well
this is a really pink I'm actually going
to kind of blend that out a little bit I
need some new music in my life you guys
should comment down below what your
favorite songs are right now because I
feel like I'm listening to the same like
10 songs on Spotify right now especially
workout songs I don't know why but I
feel like Spotify his workout playlist
suck I'll usually just make my own
playlist or listen to Pandora when I'm
working out because every spotify
playlist that's like supposed to be if
we're working out or lifting or anything
literally puts me to sleep like those
are not pump up songs but if I now on
the actual inner corner I'm gonna go
back in with this face highlight I used
brighten it up in there
so for lips I kind of want to do
something a little bit darker I feel
like I haven't done a dark lip in a
while probably will be a little intense
with this I look but that's what I'm
feeling right now so this is the pur
cosmetics addicted it's like a deep
burgundy I don't know why burgundy was
just so fun to say it's so weird when
your makeup starts creasing in different
places like I almost never crease on my
upper lip now but this is like my spot
now why is that
like what changes why am I not creasing
up here anymore I would like to know
this teeth I mean this teeth the shade
makes your teeth look really white by
the way I always get asked what I use to
whiten my teeth and I have a whole video
on it it's the pamper products talks all
about every product that I use and I
still use that exact same routine so if
you want to know how I wipe my teeth
I'll link that video down below but it's
just the pamper products video have some
fallout here this brush is balm for
catching fallout so I always see a sigma
v
just swipes it away without swiping away
any of your makeup so hope you guys
enjoyed the Shadowrun schmooze sorry it
was a little bit of a downer more than
usual if you enjoyed this video don't
