smoky palette but they just keep popping
them out like I'm going to be 50 and
Urban Decay still going to be coming out
with naked palettes
all right so today it is shadowing
schmooze time this is where I put on
makeup and talk about life I was
actually going to do like a Q&amp;amp;A style
shout on shoes I asked you guys on
social media to ask questions but there
were so many questions from you guys
that I figured let's just take those
questions and turn it into its own video
so I'm going to be doing a separate Q&amp;amp;A
video coming if you have any other
questions that you want answered in that
video you can leave them down below in
the comments but the best place to fall
along for Q&amp;amp;A is usually Twitter and
Facebook but today I'm trying out the
new Urban Decay Naked heat collection
along with a bunch of stuff from pretty
will work why can't I say that word
right now Boulder likes getting stuck in
my throat pretty vulgar cosmetics and
just a few random projects as well
everything I'm using on my face along
with the brushes is always linked down
below there's also the shadow and
trapeze playlist so if you want to go
back and watch other shadow and schmooze
videos I just did one a couple weeks ago
or was that like a month ago I don't
even know time anymore
so if you enjoy shadow and schmooze
videos and you want them to continue
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up let's jump into the makeup pickups
great all right so I have a ton of stuff
here to see there are new releases or
just new to me that we're gonna try out
this is the number 7 airbrush away
primer so if your supposed to be
flawless in seconds send me up for that
and breaking out obviously what's new
actually one of the things I wanted to
update you guys on is a keychain since
I've gotten a lot of questions about
that
this is not the kind of tube I was
expecting so my original plan as you
guys know was to go on accutane in the
summer whoa this is dripping everywhere
whoo whoa this goes on like a lotion but
then turned supersoft smells good too
without getting into too much detail I
switched neurologists I'm trying a bunch
of different things for my neck and
migraines now and for a few different
reasons I basically can't start accutane
until around the fall now which is a
bummer because I'm obviously ready to
not have acne but at the same time I'd
rather be able to function every day
house launch our guitar reinforces a sea
marine boosting mist I don't know it's
supposed to be like a finishing spray
and it says onto clean skin before
applying moisturizer whoops
probably one of those things that helps
your moisturizer and primer kind of sink
in more but that's okay I tried to do
heatless waves today to like save time
and things whenever I show these
time-saving things I feel like they end
up taking more time than if I just did
the original way
smells like lemon cleaning spray not a
big citrus fan myself so I'm definitely
still going on accutane it's just
unfortunately postponed a bit I'm mixing
the Jolie cream stick foundation soft
cream which I have a review on with the
makeup forever stick foundation in Y 205
this is their new lightest shade I guess
I actually make a white stick which I
need to buy because I do not know that
oops I think I added too much of the
makeup over
but the Jolie stick foundation is too
dark but I don't know because I've
actually been getting some a little bit
of color or something I don't know my
skin color I feel has been changing I
know if it's just because of the time of
year or what but I never used to change
in the summer at all like my skin tone
would just stay the same shade all year
yeah this is interesting so soft cream
used to be way too dark for me I'm using
just that on my forehead and I almost
feel like matches now it's looking way
lighter on camera in real life when I
look in the mirror it's matching my neck
what's new so that covered super well I
feel like my under eyes go through
phases where my concealer either looks
really good or really horrible and
lately I've been going through the
really horrible phase I think it's
actually my powder it's just not sitting
great and that usually happens are
usually like switched up go between the
physician's formula and the Stargazer I
wouldn't say my under eyes are like
especially dry right now so we're using
my more PG 38 to blend out the BH Studio
Pro concealer I've been really liking
this super affordable - it's like six
bucks around there I have a ton to talk
to you guys about I feel like May with
such a crazy month and I'm finally back
home here for a few weeks
eyelashes are falling out yeah finally
getting back into routine I'm going to
try setting my under eyes with the Laura
Geller balance and Brighton powder today
I'm just going to set the center of my
face with this too and I think I'm going
to use a different colored powder for
the rest of my face to say do you feel a
bit washed out right now using the
double-take baked powder for the rest of
my face my lower killer ooh that combo
looks good it's like super smooth I'm
going to do my eyebrows I've actually
been using the Mac cash Twilight fluid
line this is actually a liquid liner but
I love it for my eyebrows something
about the tone of this it almost has a
little bit of like
purple or red in it it just makes my
eyes pop a bit more I feel like I've
been home for like a week now and within
this week I've had a lot of news I guess
exciting things happening I was that
worried in slow motion different things
happening basically since this lease is
up and this apartment at the end of June
I've known for a couple months I think I
talked to you guys about it and shout
and schmooze that I'm going to be moving
into my own place and I've had my eye on
this one building that for a bunch of
different reasons it's been kind of up
in the air so basically I toured the
apartment everything worked out
perfectly in the same day signed like
the pre lease it's a one-bedroom but
it's huge the living room is beautiful
they're such good natural light in the
living room and in the bedroom there's a
walk-in closet there's just tons of
space which is my main issue right now
so I'm actually going to be making the
living room into like a lofty kind of
thing where my bed is actually in the
living room and we're like section off
with curtains and stuff and make it cute
and then the room with the door is
actually going to be my makeup my office
my filming room and storage and
everything like that so that's where all
my makeup is going to be kept I'm going
to finally have room to film room for
the studio lights I won't have to work
in the same place that I sleep which I'm
so excited for there's white marble
countertops in the bathroom
grey wood floors white walls it's just
perfect I'm super excited I was getting
a little sentimental signing the lease
because it's just crazy to think three
years ago now I moved to Seattle there
was three of us living in a two-bedroom
I actually have a room tour on that
apartment if you haven't seen it but I
was living in the living room we're
paying 500 bucks a month rent which is
extremely cheap for Seattle and now
three years later here we are I'm going
to try out a bunch of stuff from pretty
vulgar cosmetics this is their eye
primer I haven't tried anything from
them before I think they're three
they're sold at Ulta or Sephora now this
kind of feels like the Urban Decay
primer potion doesn't have any kind of
coverage or anything my eyelash
extensions are finally starting to fall
out which I'm actually fine with I'm
kind of debating today using false
lashes just because I missed them things
are already looking kind of sparse so I
don't know I might just totally kill
them and use false lashes today I'm
going on a couple trips back to back in
July so I am going to be getting the
lash extensions again then I think I
love them I mean I haven't seen how my
lashes are underneath
now so I guess time will tell so I think
go on a contour first I'm really liking
the way my foundation looks right now
complete full coverage looks beautiful
with that powder on top so I think I'm
going to try out the Becca sunlit
bronzer which I've tried but I've only
tried the lightest shade this one is
bronze Bondi and it actually looks like
it might work so I want to try to shade
out I prefer more of like a red bronze
ooh
this is looking like it has potential
whoa just got way too much when this out
wasn't powder brush this is the for less
cb4 brush yeah that's pretty we're going
to be trying out the naked heat
collection by urban decay I want to do a
super warm kind of bronzy glow a look so
I think I am going to bring this bronzer
up to my temples oh my eyes twitching so
anyways I have a move-in date of July
1st so that is when I'll be doing the
big move I have so much in this
apartment that I'm already starting to
pack up get rid of stuff declutter sell
stuff have been selling pretty much all
my furniture just because I want to do
like a totally different style and I
love buying furniture and decorating so
it's just fun for me so I'm starting to
do move kind of stuff already because I
really only have a few weeks blush I'm
going to try the pretty vulgar make them
blush this isn't the shade 14 sweet
revenge anger I'm going to do moving
vlogs I love watching them I also just
love watching apartment tours like
decorating videos so I think I am going
to do some of those Buddhist blushes
like exactly the look I'm going for
peachy but not too orange although
there's a little bit of a glow to it
which is weird because it looks totally
matte in the pan the packaging on here
feels extremely cheap it almost feels
like doll makeup yes like is this from
Claire's but the actual blush is a
really pretty color and it's blending
out really easily not too pigmented for
a highlighter men tried the beauty gems
a winter glow collection I've had this
since winter haven't tried it yet but
this is a brand from Ulta 3 illuminators
2 highlighters and 3 blushes here's what
the packaging looks like like a sleek
matte black for this look I might mix
the white and peach there swatching a
bit patchy and chalky the two middle
ones are swatching a bit funky but the
highlighters looks pretty nice I'm gonna
try this middle shade right here and
then might mix in a tiny bit of that
that's actually really pretty it's
emphasizing my texture a bit but that's
usually what happens with more intense
highlighters okay that's pretty if you
like super intense highlighters I'm
pretty sure this is under ten bucks and
you also get three blushes in here which
I obviously haven't tried but what I am
super excited to try is the brand new
Urban Decay Naked heat palette
apparently allure did swatches and it
looks like but then there are a
bunch of good swatches out there too so
I don't know we'll see how this is just
when you thought the naked palettes were
over make it heat I think the packaging
of this one is beautiful it's like the
smoky palette where there's like this
hard casing this is the first time I'm
opening this these look really pretty
I get like desert and vibes with this
thing which i think is the point
I love the Urban Decay ultimate Naked
basics palette that was called feel like
they stepped it up with that one I
haven't been super impressed by Naked
palette in the past I do frequently use
the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette but
that's pretty much the only one I reach
for anymore so I'm curious to see how
the formula on these are I'm gonna start
out with the shade chaser right here and
kind of set my primary slash use that in
the crease a little bit
well definitely think ahead I shot one
here already and I also wanted to update
you guys a little bit on some work stuff
it's as you guys know I do freelance
consulting stuff last I would say it's
three months I haven't really taken on
any new clients because haven't needed
to and I've been traveling so much and
I've just been really enjoying not
killing myself but this opportunity came
up for something that's just it was the
kind of thing that I literally could not
say no to I feel like I would have
majorly regretted it basically the
project is like a once in a lifetime
kind of thing so it's kind of having a
let me rethink everything situation I
was debating taking it on full-time and
hiring someone to edit my videos and
basically cutting down on YouTube which
I decided against because I love YouTube
I love what I do take me years to get to
the point where I am with it I never
planned on YouTube being my full-time
career I've always had career goals and
worked outside of YouTube and I feel
like my job is just a big part of my
identity so I feel like if I only did
YouTube I guess I wouldn't be like
pushing myself enough so basically we're
trying to figure out how can I still do
you two about the capacity I'm doing it
while taking on this new job I have no
idea what I'm doing on my eyes right now
by the way I think I'm going to take
this shade low blow which is this really
pretty
Kamel kind of color actually matches my
shirt exactly where am I going with this
so basically I decided I'm not willing
to sacrifice youtube for a full-time
thing because what that would mean is
literally doing one or two videos a week
I would have to hire someone to help
edit and do all the other stuff in order
to do this other new job full-time so
what I'm doing instead is working with
them about 15 to 20 hours a week which
is still going to be a lot like I've
been doing YouTube 40 hours a week as it
is so adding another 15 to 20 hours is
going to be an adjustment again but I
really think I would just totally regret
it if I didn't do this I don't know if
I'll be able to tell you guys at some
point what it is I definitely can't
right now but it's just crazy man the
way the world works
these are blending out really
beautifully by the way do you see this
think I'm going to take scorched which
is this like sparkly kind of red color
like a coppery red shade oh heck yeah
okay that's beautiful and so far I'm
actually getting no fallout I don't know
if the primer is helping with this but
no fallout yet at all where I'm at right
now is I'm 99% sure I'm doing it I just
need to figure out how to make
everything works now this is blending
out like butter this does not feel like
the normal Urban Decay shimmer formula
like they definitely stepped it up so
I'm going to take in Fuego which is this
deep red so between moving in the new
project probably going to be an intense
next couple months but I got this I
don't know why I voluntarily sign up for
all this that's the thing I feel like if
I'm not pushing myself and like in that
state then I'm not doing enough which I
don't know if that tilty is probably not
it's probably some kind of balance I
just haven't found it yet I don't know
if any of this is making sense by the
way I feel like for those of you who
have followed me for a long time it's
probably making sense but if you're new
it might not be you can go back and
watch my old shadow and schmoozers
because I'm pretty sure I'd go through
all this stuff hopefully some of you are
following this whole rant right now okay
these are beautiful I'm all about this
I'm going to go back in with scorched
and put that back over the lid so we got
blended away dude that shade is so
pretty definitely going to be doing some
more blending and eye shadow on the
lower lash line for sure but I want to
put some
eyeliner on the waterline and this is
the wing master plate notice nominally
this is the define no that's an eyebrow
pencil but I didn't use here we go no
that's not the straight I want here we
go this is the shade 48 I pretty vulgar
it looks like it's a brown pencil water
liner
waterline tell me why it's necessary to
put plastic around something in a box I
don't think you guys can see them on
camera from there thank God but I went
to a different nail place yesterday to
get shellac and they are literally so
freakin thick I think they're an inch
thick and bubbled up in weird places on
the end it literally look like when
jenna Marbles tried to do her own
acrylic learn my lesson they're not
going to that place again if you're in
Seattle I love Chicago nails they're out
on aurora they never do a bad job
they're amazing I don't know why I'd
tried to go somewhere else I'm sorry
Chicago nails
oh it's twist up fancy that went on the
waterline really quick and easily like
that so the lower lash line I'm going to
go back in with the naked heat palette
and I'm going to take low blow again
which is that Camel Brown kind of shade
I want this to be like super intense
super smoky since I haven't done looked
like that in a while if you like have I
probably did one last week I don't even
know anymore what else is new in life so
I've actually been trying to work out
coming back doing Jillian Michaels
whenever I don't work out for months and
I want to get in shape again I do
Jillian Michaels 30 day shred it is
amazing it actually works if you
religiously do it and it's the kind of
thing where because it's so short I
think it's like 25 minutes total you
have to really go ham and really do
every move but if you do it just tones
you up so quick I've been doing that and
then I have a couple YouTube videos that
I watch that are just like booty
workouts because I'm trying to grow the
booty you know I'm saying I've never
been someone who enjoys working out as I
like doing online videos so I can just
do it at home I have no excuse I'm
taking lumber looks like rose gold
peachy kind of shade looks really pretty
I might wet my brush actually with this
one I'm just going to use this stuff can
I put this on my eye I don't know but
we're doing it oh I might actually pop
this on the inner corner too
I've been attempting to eat healthier
key word attempting I looked at my post
mates orders yesterday and it was
literally
Pizza Cafe YUM Chipotle Pizza Cafe uncle
lay repeating I tweaked it it I've been
doing really good on breakfast so I've
been having like a green smoothie every
single morning trying to eat more
veggies I feel like I need a little more
pop right on the center maybe I put
lumber right on the middle to think I
might skip the eyeliner and just add
some intense false lashes might pull out
all my lashes wish me luck right so
lashes are on and I use pure trendsetter
I haven't tried to style before but they
remind me of bombshell
which is my favorite style buy them your
lashes rock and they last for forever
you can reuse these literally at least
ten times for less I'm deciding between
a like copper kind of lip I think that
might be too intense and I go in with
fuel this is the naked heat collection
but this one is just like a nude torch
looks kind of like a brick red liner so
I think I'm gonna use this and then go
in with fuel oh it's like so Lauren
tricking
let's not this kind of minds me abhi hue
pretty penny all right now let's going
with fuel so I'm deciding between either
adding a little bit of the Stila glitter
to my inner corner right now or putting
some of the slumber shadow on my lid to
give it like a little bit of a extra
something
yeah let's add lumber it's also kind of
helping to set that lipstick okay I
still feel like I need to brighten up
that inner corner I'm going to use some
glitter there we go
that's the pop I was looking for right
so this is a final look I am feeling
this palette I think it is beautiful
can't wait to play around with this more
I feel like there wasn't anything major
that I did not like that I tried I don't
know if the eye primer is worth it just
because I feel like there are a lot of
super similar primers I think the only
semi dead is the middle two shades in
this palette if you liked this video and
enjoy genre movies videos don't forget
