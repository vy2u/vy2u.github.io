they live in the life this is a
paintbrush
all right so today we are shadow and
schmooze in it up I am back back from my
trip this is where we do makeup talk
about life catch-up I have a lot to talk
to you guys about it's probably gonna be
a very long video so grab your coffee
grab a burrito grab a snack the usual
here we go if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
burrito family and subscribe upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. SIF
time I just thought my mic had been off
this whole time we are good
alright what is up guys I miss you guys
lashes are sticking together all the
widget setup is a struggle and a half
right now so excited to be filming right
now I just got back in last night from
my big trip I woke up at 4 a.m. this
morning
jet lag always fun so right now it's
about 10 a.m. I did not fall back asleep
I don't even know what I did for 6 hours
I know what they did I watched like four
hours of bachelor caught up I'm gonna
try out this coconut skin smoothing
priming moisturizer by not hello fresh
by hello first aid beauty so this lens I
got new lens by the way the one that we
are currently filming on I can actually
zoom in and out on here but there are
some issues with my setup basically I'm
all the way zoomed in right now and I
can't move any more forward because this
table so I need oh this is tinted has a
slight tint to it I've already washed
moisturize and we're about to prime
slash moisturize again whew this smells
good the way my table is I'm all the way
forward so I can't zoom in any more
right now since this is like a wider
angle lens it's a really nice lunge so I
hope the quality looks good but as far
as like the background and being able to
get closer I'm gonna have to move
everything around so after a film today
I'm gonna work on that repositioning
things always takes a while to get like
the background right and the lighting I
think it's gonna be a lot more exciting
for you guys when I can actually zoom up
close in foundation videos and
everything I want to be able to zoom the
lens so you can really see what I'm
looking at that feels nice has the
slight tackiness to it I feel like it
kind of slightly has like a priming
blurring effect just have a few first
impression kind of things but I'm just
gonna kind of do my makeup but mostly
just
talk to you guys since this is the
Shadowrun schmooze but Wednesday's video
I'm pretty sure is gonna be a full face
of first impressions cuz I have a
ton of new makeup here to try out but
I'm just gonna mix the covergirl
vitalist healthy elixir with the Catrice
Prime and fine lightening drops I got
this on my trip I picked up like 5
foundations and that's really the only
kind of shopping I did mostly because I
only brought a carry-on so I like really
couldn't bring a whole lot back I had a
weird flight back I stopped in Frankfurt
and on that first flight from Vienna to
Frankfurt this dude just decided he
couldn't find space for his overhead for
his bag so he just literally left it in
the middle of the aisle what people are
still getting on the plane and it turned
into this whole fiasco where people were
like freaking out because there was an
unattended bag
he wasn't claiming his bag he was just
chillin in his seat while everyone else
was freaking out I think he was like
embarrassed that he just dropped it
there but dude what the heck and then my
second flight which was 11 hours 11 1/2
hours went by hella fast it literally
felt like it was like 4 hours I just
read the whole time I've been reading
the gender game on my Kindle I just
bring the Kindle when I travel so far I
like it I'm not sure if it's by the same
author as The Hunger Games but it seems
like it's written exactly the same way
like really similarly and it has kind of
like a similar theme going on this combo
is looking really matte right now drops
must feel a little bit mattifying
because this is usually pretty dewy
I brought super minimal makeup on the
trip because I have lash extensions on
right now I don't know if you guys have
seen this in it what did I just choke on
feel like I need to add a little bit of
do to my life so I'm just gonna add some
Josie Maran vibrancy I think I got these
when I was done pretty filming I got
them like right before the trip the lash
extension so I've had them on for about
three weeks now so some of them are like
falling out and stuff but I mean pretty
good for every week's I don't know if
I'm gonna get a fill because I'm gonna
be back to filming again stuff and it's
just so much easier to film without
these on wow I haven't done a full face
of makeup in forever I finally got my
nose jewelry switched out to like a
smaller stud in right now but I got it
done at this janky mall in North
Carolina a guy just put in like a
straight-up long ass bar like it was
literally sticking out of mine
was half an inch so I didn't have time
to get it fixed between North Carolina
and leaving for the trip so I literally
had these like pliers out the night
before and I was just twisting around
the bar in my nose great ideas
I got it wrapped around enough so it
doesn't stick out but it's still doing
something funky in there so I need to
actually go into a place and get it
sorted out I have this is it right in
the center of my chest choker do your
job cover it up there we go I don't know
how I feel about that fundation combo I
want to try the concealer again that I
tried in the forever 21 video the sticks
I'd go watch that video if you want to
know how I feel about the other side I
haven't used this again yet since that
video so we'll see how it does I don't
think I'm gonna set it my concealer has
been looking much better not set lately
and actually didn't even wear under eye
concealer the whole time I was gone so
if you don't follow me on Instagram or
snapchat we have a lash going I think in
every single direction right now okay
whatever I'm gonna do that after there's
a bunch of pictures of the trip up on
Instagram I was gone for about two and a
half weeks I started out in oh I forgot
this mirrors so bizarre it like makes
you feel cross-eyed so I had a friend
who I was meeting an answer damn and we
were doing like the first part of the
trip together and then I did Vienna at
the end by myself I met my friend in
Amsterdam we were in each place for
really quick because basically she had
to get back to work so we had a certain
like timeframe we had to see each place
between so the first part of the trip
seemed like it was very fast like we
only had one full day in each place
answer damn Berlin Prague Budapest and I
ended in Vienna I'm kind of debating
posting a vlog I basically got a lot of
footage of each place and I was gonna
kind of read parts for my journal I was
journaling the whole time and then do
like a voiceover style like a little bit
different style of the vlog than I
usually do so let me know if you guys
were wanting to see that I'm debating
doing that or just keeping the footage
for myself and just to remember on if a
bunch of you want to see a vlog on it
then I will work on doing that I don't
even know how to like sum up these two
and a half weeks overall trip was
amazing it was so refreshing to just
literally take a break I didn't bring my
laptop I could not edit I purposely left
it here because I knew if I had it I
would try and work I only checked emails
a few times I try
- really disconnect I'd say I was off
social media off my phone for 90% of the
day I tried to really take a break
because I don't think I've really taken
an actual break for a couple years I
wrote a whole post kind of talking about
this on Instagram which ways my brush
right now there we go
it's so easy to get wrapped up in this
world and kind of forget what life is
actually about sometimes and for me it's
not it's not about a lot of things that
being on social media comes with I do
videos because I genuinely enjoy making
them I love the creative aspect of it I
love coming up with ideas I've tried to
think about the best way to phrase this
without sounding not grateful for what I
have because I am so grateful for you
guys and I'm so grateful that I have
this platform in place to share things
with you guys and just talk about things
that are important to me and the fact
that this is a job for me I never
predicted that ever so I think a lot of
the things that attract people to doing
YouTube like I don't know like the
events people recognizing you award
things like all that kind of stuff is
just not it's not me and I've just kind
of realized that I'm just gonna keep
doing what I like doing I just don't
ever want to sacrifice memories and
moments and friendships for the sake of
social media and growing in this weird
social media world it's just not what I
want I don't know if any of that makes
sense I don't think it is my channel is
coming up on 500,000 subscribers and it
is mind-blowing to me I wanted to say
thank you I so appreciate each one of
you guys I would honestly be entirely
content if my channel stayed this size
because I don't know I just feel like I
don't know if I want what comes with
going up from here that makes any sense
I don't know how we just went from
Europe trip to all that I don't know
that's just how I've been feeling and I
feel like especially on the trip when I
was sitting on trains for hours without
internet and just literally thinking and
writing I had time to process all of
that has spent like 20
thousand hours on that brow and whoa
what did I just do I need to clean this
thing up this is a paint brush this is
the only concealer like brush I can find
right now I'm just using this concealer
getting some on there don't know if this
is gonna work to clean up the brows I
might have just cut out that whole
entire rant because I don't know if any
of that made sense and I'm excited for
2018 I think there's gonna be some good
changes happenin
but anyways back to the trip and
everything so I did journal the whole
time which was really therapeutic
actually have the journals right here so
I can show you guys but I got the outer
case thing off of Amazon I'll link it
down below and then I got these totally
getting makeup all over this right now
and then the actual journals I got these
little field notebook kind of things for
each city so I have one for Budapest it
spelled Budapest in English but it's
pronounced Budapest profession so I just
filled up each journal I have one from
Berlin here I tried to get stickers in
your study it is working hard to find
stickers these days let me tell you so
I'm gonna keep all of these and I save
some like train tickets and museum
tickets and stuff in different postcards
so I'm for all this in like a scrapbook
type thing because currently all the
places I've traveled I only have either
vlogs or nothing from and I so wish that
I wrote down stuff and kept journals for
some of the places I went two years ago
because I feel like I already forget so
much I really wish I had one for when I
was living in Jordan I'm just gonna
start doing that for every place I visit
because you forget so many of the small
details like I don't even remember what
I ate for dinner last night so my
favorite place out of all those was
Berlin I loved Berlin I wish I had more
time in there but I think we'll be back
there shout out to all the German Bay
Rados things for all the recommendations
by the way if you guys lived in any of
those places I think Budapest and Berlin
had the most had the most of you who
lived there it seemed like I think I
actually I'm gonna set this concealer I
wish I could have met you guys in eh
City but it was so quick I was there for
such a little time that it was like we
were doing back-to-back things and it
was peace out next city we got Berlin
was definitely my favorite also Budapest
was amazing
so beautiful so is Vienna when I was in
Berlin I actually got to catch up with a
friend who I met five years ago now when
I was living at a random dudes apartment
in Israel she was his friend she
basically like lived with us too and we
became really good friends when I was
there
and I got to catch up with her and she's
pregnant now so it's just crazy five
years later dude whoa
you just never know who you're gonna
meet what's gonna happen bronzor I'm
gonna use physician's formula butter
bronzer they came out the new shade that
apparently is like a reddish bronze so I
need to pick that up but this is just
the bronze shade I like this better than
the lightest one I got a lot of
questions from you guys about how I plan
my travel if I budget how I find places
to eat all that good stuff I think I've
talked about this before in a shouter
inch moves like a while ago but I
basically go on kayak explore and
Skyscanner
and that's where I find the best flight
deals if you have a flexible schedule
definitely go on kayak explore because
they'll give you random dates where you
can get hella cheap flights and I turn
on notifications for them so when a
really good flight deal comes up out of
Seattle you can just go on and buy it
like this morning I think there was a
$450 round-trip flight to Tokyo if you
have the flexibility that's the way to
do it you can get really good deals on
there I also use Ebates if I'm booking
anything through like booking comm or
whatever love them you can get it
basically free money through just using
the link through them as far as planning
I typically just pick a spot and then
figure everything else out I'll just
Google top things to see there and then
I'll do some research to just ask people
if you're staying at a hostel ask the
people at the front desk hostels are the
way to go did have an interesting hostel
experience and Budapest though I also
had like the flu or something while I
was gone
it was an interesting trip it was really
fun but a lot of like random all things
happen but I don't know what it was but
basically for about a week of the trip I
had some kind of stomach thing where I
would randomly throw up I would get like
super nauseous out of the blue couldn't
really keep food down had it just been
something I ate but it lasted for a
while off and on but anyway is going
from Prague to Budapest we took the
train everywhere that's the way to do it
in Europe just don't book the tickets in
advance just makes traveling so easy you
can literally just zone out on the train
for like hours it's great I love trains
I was like throwing up non-stop the
night before we were supposed to go on
the train from Prague to Budapest I
ended up feeling okay in the morning so
we made it on the train once we got to
Budapest we checked into the hostel and
it was like a ten bed dorm it was super
hot in there when we got in but I don't
really think anything I thought that
it was just like turned up we slept
there that night I think I was feeling
okay that night I felt like kind of
feverish and then when I woke up I kid
you not we woke up in a fricken sauna
the heat broke in the middle of the
night and basically was all the way up
and it didn't turn off at all and on top
of that we were in this ten bed dorm
where we were on a second level so it
was like literally ten degrees hotter on
the second level since it heat rises
science so when I woke up I was nauseous
drenched in sweat felt super dehydrated
had like zero energy literally felt like
I was gonna pass out standing outside in
like 35 degree weather in shorts that's
how friggin overheated we all were in
there a couple hours later the water and
plumbing went out so that's when we
checked out of there ended up getting an
Airbnb which was amazing if you're going
to Budapest stay in a place called the
pink parrot I'll link it down below is
on booking and it was still really
affordable if you're like splitting with
someone it was the best location they
had parrot wallpaper which is always a
plus and just being sick and feeling
shitty going from the hostel to there
was definitely a good call
I think Prague is definitely a place to
go in the summer
liked Prague just compared to everywhere
else I think that was the place I liked
the least out of everywhere but I could
see how in the summer with all the beer
gardens and water and everything it
would be probably hella fun I lost some
weight because I was walking literally
seven miles a day I like legs toned up
it's amazing what happens when you
actually kind of work out I'm gonna try
and keep that going in Seattle just go
on long walks every everyday that's
ambitious maybe like four times a week
and I was not getting good I was eating
pretty much like a diet consisting of
carbs okay so I am so excited to try us
out I've heard so much about this brand
this is the siharan palette by joe vias
place hell yeah look at that autofocus
on the new ones this wood Dobby I think
this shade right here looks beautiful I
think gonna use that I'm gonna start out
with this tan shade first actually
course I'm gonna put my bronzer in the
crease try and think what else about the
trip I don't know if you guys have any
specific questions let me know down
below I think I'm gonna film another
shadow and schmooze
next week because I have a totally
different topic I want to talk to you
guys about so if you have any other
questions I can answer him in that video
so leave them in the comments down below
but yeah overall really good much-needed
break
I feel re-energized I'm excited to be
filming and back to work and everything
exciting news I am starting to pre film
in February for the next 15 days of
foundation series which is gonna be in
March I'm not gonna be announcing the
exact dates yet it is gonna be in March
project Beauty share and I have been
working on this for 5 months now maybe
six months a long time this one is gonna
be big there's a lot of technical things
we're trying to work out but for those
of you who are new project Beauty share
is a non-profit who donates gently use
makeup to women shelters and women in
need and I've worked with them for a
couple years now they're amazing the
other thing I wanted to chat with you
guys about is starting the foundation
videos without foundation on again it
seems like it's pretty split half half
people who want to see them start
without foundation on the beginning and
people who don't care and just
personally I've talked about this in
past videos when I land on someone's
channel and they start off the video
with a bare face on it just doesn't look
as like put together really like
starting out the videos with a full face
of makeup on and doesn't ruin a whole
lot in my opinion because it tells you
nothing about the foundation there are
so many foundations that I can make work
and especially on camera that look okay
that end up being horrible that don't
work out for me at all really doesn't
ruin a whole lot or tell you anything
about the foundation coming on since
there are some of you who like starting
without the foundation on at the
beginning I will try and do more
starting that way as well just to please
everyone you know or attempt to it's a
pretty shade stars 15 days of
foundations still gonna be doing those a
few times a year foundation Friday still
going strong I have still like 30
foundations sitting in a drawer that are
gonna be reviewed say I'm gonna be
starting to pre film in February 4:15 is
a foundation let me know which
foundations you guys want to see in the
next series
I'm excited February it's gonna be
intense cuz I'm gonna be pre filming for
that working on the behind the scenes
stuff for that and then still trying to
get my three week up I'm also gonna be
out of town again in February at family
coming to visit here in February some
things I can see in the viewfinder but
not in real life
HD cameras man they're wild my
extensions are popping out and like
every possible place right now because
I'm way past due for getting them REE
taped we can do a little hair update so
my real hair is getting long it's right
there now before it was like literally
up to here so I think I'm gonna let it
grow out a little bit more couple more
inches and then take out the extensions
tape ins are the way to go though you
don't have to worry about anything okay
I'm gonna go in with that super pretty
greenish gold shade I can't take my
finger with the eyelash extensions are
kind of hard to get right against the
lash lines so I'm gonna take a shadow
brush I so so desperately need to clean
all my brushes let's talk about the new
year that's always a fun topic look at
that shade this reminds me of that Etsy
one I used I need to whip out their
shadows again where did I even put those
I did a full face using Etsy makeup
video and those shadows were pretty bomb
dude look at that shade I think I have
to like main goals four dozen 18 my
first one is to put more effort into my
long distance friendships because I am
horrible at keeping in touch with people
I'm horrible at calling people answering
phone calls responding to texts which is
ironic because I feel like I'm good at
long-distance relationships but
friendships not so much the majority of
my friends I've met through random
things living in random places they're
kind of scattered all over the US and
the world I want to just make more of an
effort of reaching out to them because I
feel like a lot of times friends know
what's going on in my life because of
YouTube but I don't know what's going on
in theirs so I just want to make more of
a conscious effort to help people and to
see what's going on that's my main goal
the other thing that
happening it's not even a goal that's
happening in 2018 is moving moving out
of Seattle open if it's just for a few
months and saying I'm ready for a change
and move and do something new for I feel
like a couple years now because I just
never thought I was gonna be in Seattle
this long I love Seattle which is why
it's so hard to leave it I'm just ready
for something new ready to switch it up
and this is the year it's happening I
have a couple ideas on places I want to
go and I think it's gonna be happening
in late August or September I'm gonna
take this red right here either way
wherever I end up moving I'm gonna hold
on to this apartment because I don't
want to like permanently leave Seattle
and I love this apartment so I'll
probably try and rent it out or
something that red Wow so I guess I'd
gotten yesterday the first thing I did
was post mates to Chipotle I was having
major Chipotle cravings I usually have
Chipotle at least once a week really
healthy um actually it's not too bad I
just get the burrito bowl and chips and
walk it was heavenly last night I put on
The Bachelor was he injured pull a
living the life like strategizing what I
want my next meal to be what is that one
meal that when you guys get back from

speaking of The Bachelor let's talk
about it how do you guys feel about re
before this season started I went back
and watched re season when he was on

liked him on her season but I feel like
for being The Bachelor I don't know he's
a little awkward like I don't think he's
quite cut out for it but I hey I hope
you find someone none of the girls are
really standing out for me I really like
Becca I think that's one the one with
the short hair she seems awesome like I
just want to chill with her crystal
crystal crystal
I cannot stand I can't she needs to like
do ASMR something I'm just kind of
cleaning up that color a little bit
these shadows are nice I'm gonna take
that brown shade we started with and
blend that on the lower lash line trying
to decide if I want to do why yeah I
think I need liner with this I just
impromptu decided to do a giveaway in

supporting my channel I'm gonna go in
with the highlight shade for my inner
corner that same white shade right there
this physician's form of spray is really
weird it dries almost instantly it's a
really bizarre it makes it feel
literally dry there must be a ton
of alcohol or something in there let's
try out this eyeliner this is vigor
lactic it's the precise eyeliner marker
liner with lashes is a little bit tricky
not super black on top of these shadows
at least
yeah it doesn't go over shadow very well
well we've got a lash in the eyeball
folks okay I've gotta go in with my
normal eyeliner because this is not
wanting to go over the shadow I'm gonna
take the black shadow in the palette on
a flat edge brush again and just push
that right against my lash line I might
put some eyeliner on the waterline - I'm
so excited to try out these new products
in this week's first impressions video I
think there's been a ton of
releases lately and I am reviewing the
Tarte foundation shape tape foundation
gotten a lot of messages about that or
did the lightest shade in each formula
so I'm going to do I think half my face
hydrating half my face the matte formula
and just see how it is I'll give you my
thoughts on the shade range and
everything alright I'm gonna blend this
out the black shade and there's nice
it's not too muddy I purchased this
Julius place palette along with a few
other kind of indie brands because I
want to do a video on that but I think I
want to try each one out first and do
like kind of a full thoughts and review
on them comment down below any other
indie brands or eyeshadow palettes
specifically that you would want to see
reviewed and try it out tried to find
someone Instagram that are popular but
not huge indie brands if you know what I
mean let's do a little acting update I'm
almost at 4 months I'll be four months
in about a week and a half yeah whoa I'm
over halfway done that's kind of wild
pretty much exactly the same side
effects and everything as the last
update I gave you guys nothing new
nothing to report still getting some
breakouts like mostly on my chin area
and down here eczema and dryness has
been mostly just on my hands I'm posting
kind of before-and-after photos on
Twitter I think I'm gonna go all out
with the orange red theme yeah let's do
it this is the kathleenlights colourpop
ultra satin lip this might be too much
with this look whoa
I think this is gonna be too much with
this look super pretty color I might mix
it let's mix it I'm gonna tone it down a
little bit this is the flower Beauty
miracle matte lip in Rosewood that color
pop shade would be super pretty with
just like basic eyes oh I have one of
those big cracks right
corner and now just to add a little pop
bring it all together I'm gonna put a
tiny bit of this okay I'm changing my
mind 500 million times right now but I'm
gonna put some eyeliner on my waterline
might add a little bit more contour a
little bit more everything right now by
a little bit more I mean at the contour
it's full bronze Ron I'm gonna do a
little bit of the Catrice prime and fine
I've been loving this alright so I think
that is about it I'm excited to keep
playing around with this palette there's
something about the shade arrangement
assortment there's the word I'm looking
