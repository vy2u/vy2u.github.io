you're from let's do this alright good
mornin we're shadow and schmooze in it
up Cheers
it feels so good to be sitting and doing
it shadow and schmooze it's been so
friggin long I feel like because of 15
days foundation and everything
everything I'm using will be down below
in the description box but I'm just
gonna know what the origins this is
actually called poor perfecting cooling
primer I couldn't really like in this it
feels so nice and cooling and it's
surprisingly moisturizing like I did not
think a foam thing would be this
moisturizing have a bit of dryness down
here right now so I'm gonna go with the
pixie Rose flash bomb oh I hate the
smell of rose rose just straight-up
smells like bathroom potpourri to me so
I only have three days left on accutane
when I'm filming this when you guys are
seeing this I'll be done and I think
actually the day this goes up is gonna
be my accutane appointment where I go
over the final lab tests and everything
and then I am dunzo so I am gonna be
having a final kind of accutane video
going over just my overall experience
and progress photos and everything so
I'm gonna go in with my two-faced
settings great this is literally
actually I don't think there's anything
in here I need to get a new one I've
been saving my stuff for another empties
video because I feel like you guys liked
that one because it was kind of like
many reviews on the products that I've
actually used up and everything alright
so probably one of the most asked
questions was about fostering and brooke
says how is fostering going do you find
it
to do living in a big city and finding
the time around your busy schedule and
then there are a lot of questions -
about traveling and fostering and if I'm
traveling less now that I'm fostering
I'm gonna mix these two foundations
together camera I've tried this combo so
if you follow me on twitter snapchat
you're probably sick of seeing Snoopy at
this point but Snoopy is my first little
foster guy and I fostered through
Seattle humane they have an awesome
foster program and just adoption they're
a great shelter if you're looking to
adopt in Washington you have to do like
a whole training and stuff and you
foster and they just tell you all about
the organization and they just they rock
their no-kill shelter I was kind of
waiting this whole time to foster until
after 15 days of foundation because they
literally have no life when I start
filming that series I knew I needed to
wait until after so I had the time to do
it actually didn't even see Snoopy on
there was going for a different dog who
didn't end up working out but Snoopy was
there
they say he's seven years old he seems a
lot older than that to me he's mostly
blind mostly deaf but he is the sweetest
little guy he's up for adoption for me
fostering is perfect I'm not at a place
where I feel like I can commit to having
a dog I'm gonna be moving a lot I'm also
not here a lot and fostering just gives
them a home away from the shelter until
they find their forever home so to
answer the question for me it's actually
perfect because he is really chill I
don't think it's difficult to foster
living in a big city
most apartment buildings especially have
like dog outdoor pee things this is
looking very matte what the heck why
this looking so matte both of these are
like do here so Zoey says I fell in love
with your video six years ago when I
started watching your tailoring series
oh good are you going to do more of
those in the future definitely not I
feel like I'm so different than I was
when I first started my youtube channel
was what was it sophomore year of
college so it's been a while you know
and I feel like I know I just I've
changed a lot
and I'm just not in the Taylor rant
phase anymore I've thought about putting
those videos on private I watch it and
I'm like who actually is that I have no
idea so this is the k'kaw concealer
mixed with Maybelline fit me I haven't
tried these two mixed before yet but I'm
actually gonna use my sponge to blend
this out because the k'kaw one can be a
little bit not dry it's just like harder
lips a little
easier to blend out with the sponge
sometimes I'm just like not that pissed
about things anymore I can't get to the
headspace to do a tailor right you know
also things that we I always see her on
Twitter and she always tweets so thank
you
Brandon says would you ever work for Mac
again I worked for Mac in college when I
was going to school I did that was a
freelancer for Mac I learned a lot at
Mac that was like a really great I loved
it I loved that job but it was also
really challenging as an introvert
because you have to be friggin on for
like nine hours and super bubbly and
like it's just not it's not me when I
worked there I really loved it I had
great people that I was working with had
a great manager but for me that was very
much like a college job so I wouldn't
work out Mac again I think I'm just at a
really different point in my life right
now but if you're interested in working
at Mac I have an old video all about how
I got a job at Mac and I would recommend
it if nothing else jobs like that are
always a really good learning experience
and I think working in customer service
is something that everyone should do
everyone says that but it's so true
because whoa it's kind of crease in a
lot right now this combo I'm gonna mix
my normal darker Physicians Formula
powder with the brightening powder the
marina on Facebook says talk about
behind-the-scenes stuff in 15 days
foundation we need some mac fix+ in here
before I do my brows I'm smell sprays on
I actually love the scent of the
original mac fix+
smell so refreshing I think this time
around was definitely the most stressed
I've ever been for 15 days of foundation
and not the actual foundation videos but
just there was a lot going on look at
how crazy of a difference that makes now
my forehead is dewy all of the other
stuff that went along with the whole
campaign hours and hours of
back-and-forth emails working on the
landing page working with the developer
working with the actual voting widget
thing like just all that it was a lot on
top of everything else and on top of
that I was just traveling so much and
then I was still trying to stick with my
health stuff I'm supposed to be like
going to the chiropractor and physical
therapy three times a week so with
filming foundation
that was really hard it basically just
didn't happen so my health just went
down the drain of course it was just
like right when I kind of started that
whole plan I showed up to my Cairo after
like four weeks and he literally wanted
the murder me I think I'm going in with
my Maybelline tattoo studio I just
dipped the brush in and then go in I
really wanted to get my normal three
videos a week leading up to it like to
the start 15 days of foundation so it
was just a shit ton of videos a shit ton
of stuff going on I basically was not
sleeping I wake up at 6:30 and I would
work from 7:00 a.m. until like 9:00 at
night would not recommend so somehow it
all worked out I've actually really been
liking the aoa studio go brow in the
shade what does this doesn't have it on
here but it's like the dark brown shade
again everything will be linked down
below but I tried this out in the dollar
makeup video and I've actually been
using this on like an everyday basis
even if I don't put that Maybelline one
on because it gives my brows a really
nice color to them and it does kind of
bring the hairs out a little bit it's a
little bit more of a dry formula every
video oh yeah this combo is crease in a
shit and all right would not use that
again I actually was gonna do kind of
like a behind-the-scenes of 15 days of
foundation vlog but I ended up just
getting like random clips mostly when I
was like on the verge of a breakdown
stress so I feel like there's no point
in like including that in the blog now
because it's done it's over you know I'm
saying well my hand feels so shaky right
now what the heck
I just like to draw on a few front hairs
to give it that illusion
Leisha on facebook says would you ever
do another product club with a brand or
maybe even start your own makeup line a
foundation perhaps I think that's like
one of my most asked questions is if I
would ever make my own foundation aren't
my own makeup line and that's honestly
never been it's not something I want I
don't know I don't want my own makeup
brand I definitely want my own brand of
some source but I don't think it would
be makeup and I've kind of been trying
to think in my head the last probably a
year like what that would be I love the
idea though of creating my own products
with other brands like doing clubs and
one is come in very soon I think that's
like the best of both worlds because you
don't have to have the brand but you get
to have a say and if
no product that's created and everything
and I love product design and packaging
and everything that whole aspect of
creating a product I love there are a
few questions about what does a typical
week look like for you this one's from
Lauren thank you for the really sweet
comment by the way for bronzer I'm going
to use this new morphe that came out
these duo's this is in glitterati and
this shade is very light it almost looks
like what's called why can't I think of
you know I'm talking about benefit was a
to face of benefit why am I totally
thinking on this bronzer I have a whole
video on it if you're pale you probably
know what I'm talking about
so I'm gonna try out the blush from the
Patrick Starr thing this shade looks
really pretty so typical week I wake up
at 6:30 or 7:00 almost every single day
because a I never know how I'm gonna be
feeling health-wise when I wake up so if
I wake up that early it gives me like a
few hours to recover if I have to take a
migraine pill and the pill usually kicks
in in a few hours for me so if I take it
out like seven then hopefully I'm
functioning by like ten and then I can
still do stuff I think that really helps
me because if I did that later then I
would lose like half the day and then
you get even more frustrated if you have
chronic pain you know I'm talking about
just gonna be really frustrating because
you literally never know what you're
gonna be able to do that day and how
you're gonna get done this is really
pretty by the way
ooh I like that that's like a pretty
springy kind of blush I was like a
slight glow to it but I feel like that
shade is just really flattering if I'm
feeling good in the morning usually I'll
film pretty early I have my whole week's
planned out not like to the minute or
anything just what I need to get done
that week so I usually kind of like zone
off different days for things so if I
know I have to go to the chiropractor
three times a week then I just plan that
into filming because obviously I'm not
gonna be able to film like a where test
video on those days and stuff as I
usually like my editing days and I'll
have filming days and usually I end up
being done filming around one or two and
then I'll try and edit a video after
that and do emails and work on other
projects and just other things going on
work out I've been working out shit done
I've been doing Jillian Michaels I also
stopped taking gabapentin which if you
have noticed that I've kind of lost a
little bit of weight and I definitely
think the gabapentin made me gay
like 10 pounds especially in my face I
was like holding it in my face if you
look back on videos a couple months ago
they say gabapentin has like a slow
weight gain and then all of a sudden
you're like what the heck and I
definitely see it now this looks pretty
yellow this highlight that might be
pretty can't help is gonna be too yellow
this is the more feel it I feel so old
Tang lit why did that just sound like I
was like a seven year old person singlet
hoping this isn't gonna be too off of
the color that's pretty that actually
almost looks like the new NARS ones
actually that looks very similar to the
NARS highlights actually have one
sitting right here it's entirely lost my
train of thought this happens like
50,000 times when I film these videos I
just literally stop for like two minutes
and try and remember what is Oh Gavin
yeah nothing exciting Gavin so yeah I've
been working out I've been trying to
work out like five days a week I've been
doing Jillian Michaels 30 day shred kind
of forget what my body looks like when
I'm like working out so I just wanted to
see where I can get it to basically
really pretty
I usually go through phases where I'm
like all in with working out and then I
get to the point where I want and then I
just go back to not working out so I'm
trying to just like have a healthier
mindset I've actually been eating really
healthy lately I started doing not
sponsored but I started doing imperfect
produce which I think it's only in a few
cities now but in Seattle we have it and
it's basically like the vegetables and
stuff that don't sell in supermarkets
because they're a little bit off looking
and you just save them from going to
waste and you get like a discounted
price on the Box they deliver it every
week whenever you get a ton of veggies
and stuff and I feel like now that I've
been doing that I'm forced to eat more
vegetables because I already have them
and I don't want them to go to waste
I've been cooking a lot more I've only
been postmates Singh like once every
week and a half which is a huge huge
improvement for me I usually post me
it's like multiple times a week starting
to tone up again if you want it quick at
home work out dude do Jillian Michaels
30 day shred I swear by it I've done it
for years and whenever I want to get
back in shape it actually works and it's
only like 30 minutes which is the thing
that really sells me on it because I'm
like I have no excuse not to do this do
you feel like it kind of makes my body
worse because it's it is a little bit
like too high impact so some things I'll
do like alternative versions for but you
can buy the
like dvds used on Amazon for super cheap
or I just buy it on Amazon I think it's
like $2.99 or something one time and
then you can play it as much as you want
so there are a few questions about jobs
like past jobs Bronte whoo that's a cool
name Bronte says if YouTube stopped
existing and you had to pick a normal
nine-to-five job what would you choose
I'm assuming there's a lot of new people
here because there are a lot of similar
questions about that and I do have my
own consulting business worked in
marketing and tech different startups
and agencies though if YouTube stopped
existing tomorrow I would definitely
just go back to that the way things
change something new is gonna come along
at YouTube isn't gonna be around for
forever and I think we just need to be
ready for that so yeah I would go back
to working marketing that's also what I
love and passion about I think I'm gonna
try out the Too Faced natural matte
palette I tried out their bronzers and I
don't know if it was just like the way I
was applying it now I can't find one I
think they're in the donate band right
now because they had I think I had to
face imprinted on the bronzer and I got
so much freaking patchiness with it only
tried it one time at night but it got
weird like the lettering almost got like
imprinted on my cheek
after I swirled it and like tried to
blend it out so I don't know I'm gonna
have to try that again but I think I'm
gonna go in with this matte palette and
try it out if I had like two other lives
I would want to do interior design and I
also would want to do product design I
think that would be really fun Brianna
says how did you ever work up the
confidence to take the plunge and make
youtube videos I love makeup and I've
been watching makeup videos since I was
10 I'm now 18 but I don't think I could
ever have the confidence to actually
post a video or read hate slash negative
comments I think of it something that
you really want to do regardless of what
it what that thing is you should at
least try it because you never know like
you're just gonna be wondering about
doing it this whole time if you never
actually try and there's really nothing
to lose because first thing that happens
is you upload a couple videos and you
realize it's not for you or you love it
and you want to keep going and I think
the whole hate comment thing like that's
just part of it you have to know that
that that will come but I think you
might as well try I mean there's
literally nothing to lose and you won't
have to deal with that for a long time
likely like you'll probably upload
videos for months before that really
starts coming and people are like
finding your videos and you have to do
that and especially it sounds like
you've loved it for so long and you've
been into makeup for so long that you
should just try it do it do it oh wow
the shade is called sexpert so we're
gonna go in with a sexpert I don't know
if I'm doing an all matte look right now
or if I'm gonna pop like a shimmer shade
on my lids or something I kind of wanted
shimmer
I was really pigmented irie says if you
had studied or worked for something
other than what you have what do you
think it'd be so I did do that I did not
study for what I do now or even in the
marketing space at all until senior year
when I got a business minor I studied
international relations and I learned
Arabic so I definitely thought I was
gonna be doing something totally
different I wanted to work for the State
Department or do interpreting and I
thought I was gonna be like living in
the Middle East I'm totally doing
something different than I thought it
was gonna be I still think that somehow
I want to make those two worlds come
together definitely think that I want
this to somehow come full circle I'm
just trying to figure out how she also
says what kind of youtubers are you
subscribed to I go through phases I feel
like everyone does where you have those
youtubers that you just like binge and
that you're really into at the moment
more into vloggers than I am like
watching Beauty videos Casey Holmes is
like the one Beauty person I always
watch iris also says do you collect
anything or do you have a hobby that you
don't really talk about dad I used to
collect flat pennies you know those
machines where you put in whatever and
they give you like a flattened penny
Wow did that need an explanation
probably not I collect rubber ducks for
a while that was a weird phase think I
collected more as a kid I had a lot of
weird collections as a kid
Alania says I love you to share your
personal philosophy on how you live your
best life even in the face of health
problems I'm struggling to find hope and
motivation to move forward in the face
of severe chronic pain and disability
you seem to be so positive and wise
beyond your years
thank you oh and you're an organ
neighbor I personally try and focus on
the good days and make the most out of a
good day when I have one there are
certain rare days probably like once I
don't even know once every two months
maybe like once every month and a half
where my entire body feels good and I
literally can't even comprehend feeling
like that every single day it would be
unreal how a lot of people can feel like
that every single day I feel like I
would be on like cloud
9 so when those good days come I just
try and be really thankful for them and
do as much as I can we never know what
someone's going through I don't know
what kind of pain you have or what kind
of disability you have but I also think
it's really different when you've grown
up with something versus when something
comes on I think in a messed-up way it's
it's almost easier to deal with when
there's someone like me who has had this
for I don't know how long now it's 13
years now at least where it's just
become part of my life like this is it
is what it is and I've just had to learn
how to deal with it and live with it and
so I think if you just had something
come on like if someone gets an accident
something horrible happens whatever like
if you just all of a sudden have chronic
pain you are used to living the best
life and then your quality of life goes
down so much that I can I've had that
happen to me with family in real life
where that happens to them and it's it's
rough because they can't comprehend how
to kind of go from that point down to
here versus if you're already down here
you just kind of you keep moving and you
do it I think one of the things that
really helps me with coping is having at
least one friend my life that is that
person who understands completely for me
that's Rach she's been there through I
can't even count how many Hospital trips
trips to the ER puking for 810 hours
like she's seen it all and so to have
someone in your life who really gets it
I think is super important because if
you have chronic pain you know there's
nothing more frustrating than having
people just not understand at all like I
just ate tissue or something where did
that come from
I'm just going in I don't even know what
I'm doing right now I'm going in with
hook up and just going in with like
random mix of shades what is this
palette we have nude goals cleavage I'm
confused
this is called natural Matt what are
they trying to do like a NARS situation
up in here I don't know if that helped
at all but I feel like it's just all
about outlook and doing the best you can
with the days that you do feel decent I
think I might go in with the BH festival
palette I've only tried one shade out of
here
I used this shade in the wrap up video I
think that yeah wear that in the wrap up
video yellow shades can be really hit
so hopefully this isn't a shitty yellow
this is the shade at euphoria Erin says
what do you do if you see subscribers as
you're out and about let's say you're
shopping an Ulta would it be ok to come
up and say hello hell yeah please come
say hi she says maybe get a picture what
about in other places like what are your
boundaries yeah if you guys see me as
I'm out and about please say hi it's so
much more awkward sometimes you can see
someone looking and you have a feeling
but they don't say anything and they
just keep looking and that is 50 billion
times more awkward for everyone involved
so just come say hi we'll hug it out we
can hang out we'll talk I love meeting
guys in real life it's what makes all
this really cool for me so if you see me
please say something this oh hell yeah
okay let's try this on the lid and I
might wet this too with the brush
afterwards whenever I meet you guys in
real life I think every single person
says how much shorter I am than they
thought it was just first placing this
down with my finger and then I'm gonna
go and like blend out the edges and I
think I want to wet this with a brush
too but for a yellow shade this actually
has a lot of pigment to it usually
yellow this can be super hit or miss as
far as wear whatever no just come say hi
add someone in the San Diego Airport one
time in the bathroom come say hi so I
think that was like my weirdest
encounter but I'm glad she said
something people have come up to my dad
to which is funny which don't get me
wrong
he loves Rihanna says how was your
college experience and how did he make
the most of it I'm currently hating it
and someone else said yeah I'd love to
hear about this
I wonder what aspect she's not liking
school or the social aspect or what
because I feel like I would have more
advice to give you if I knew which part
you weren't liking but for me I loved
college I really loved college I had
like an awesome college experience
freshman year of college was one of the
most cool like special years of my life
I feel like it was just such a big
change so different met so many people
did so many things in a new state and
everything and I just loved it actually
was talking to someone the other day
and I asked them like if there was one
year of their life that they could go
back to what they but you wouldn't know
how like the rest would turn out and I
feel like the only year that I would
like ever consider
going back to and doing that would be
freshman year of college okay I haven't
tried this pellet at all yet the stuff
gland pellet by anastasiya but there's a
black shade in here so I think I'm gonna
take this because it's the only black
that's like semi close to me right now
but if you're not liking it maybe you
need to switch schools I actually know a
few people who didn't have a good
freshman year experience and switch
schools and they ended up being so much
happier
whether it's switching to something you
know like totally different like maybe
write a four-year and you switch to
Community College or vice versa I think
that's totally fine to do if you're not
happy but also that's the year to like
try whatever the heck do new things
experience new things and doing that
would probably like help you meet new
people or a lot of questions about
moving so Kristin says are your plans to
move in the future going to take you
somewhere else in the US or abroad I
love your videos and your attention to
detail thanks ma'am so that is currently
to be determined I've been trying to
figure this out for like the last two
months I think like since I mentioned
moving in that video I had a clear idea
of what I was gonna do and then like
something came up and whatever so now
I'm like back to trying to figure out
what the heck I'm doing basically my
lease here is up in the summer I
realized that I definitely want to hold
on to this apartment because just with
the amount of crap I have in the whole
filming setup and everything I think I'm
gonna keep this apartment come back here
to film pre film whatever and then just
take shorter like couple month long
trips or month long trips and live in
different places that way so I've really
been considering Berlin I loved Berlin
so I'm thinking about doing that for a
couple months in the early fall and just
holding onto this place getting videos
done and then going and either living in
Berlin or traveling from there I'm also
considering Lebanon which I haven't told
my parents yet so dad if you're watching
this Jill I definitely want to go back
to Jordan to visit my host family and
everything and like stay for a couple
weeks but within the u.s. I'm definitely
considering Chicago that's like at the
top of my list of Chicago so I don't
know I'm going to Chicago and June
actually so I'm gonna kind of like scope
it out while I'm there they do want
somewhere to like base everything out of
probably within the US that would also
be way easier just with all the packages
and stuff there's like a lot
weird small things that I have to
consider with YouTube and having like a
business in the US and tax it there's a
bunch of weird stuff so it's just easier
to base everything out of the US
obviously I would be paying double rent
which would be really shitty especially
considering this would literally just be
sitting here I've looked into investing
in property basically and then I would
have somewhere to like keep my stuff
where I'd be paying a mortgage versus
paying rent that just gets thrown away
but honestly the market is so high right
now and so ridiculous that it's just not
a good time to buy not to be too much of
a realist but the markets probably gonna
crash in a few years just saying but it
would be nice to not just be throwing
away money every month on rent I'm gonna
take hook up again this shade there were
a lot of likes on this tweet could you
do a video on budgeting this is from
core oh by the way you seem very good
with finances and it'd be interesting to
see how you manage it all I don't have
like a set monthly budget or anything
I've never been a big spender like I
would way rather save my money I have
all my money sitting in the bank I loan
it and I do other things with it so it's
building on itself without you actually
having to do anything as far as
budgeting even though I'm like very
planner planner esque in the rest of my
life I don't really plan or like make
actual budgets for things I just have an
idea in my mind of what I'm gonna spend
that month and I just don't go past it
I'm just like aware of what I'm spending
and saving and obviously if I know I
have a big trip or something coming up
probably not the best month to like make
a big purchase to actually don't spend a
whole lot of money outside of things
that I write off for YouTube I shop a
lot for YouTube but those are all tax
write-offs cuz they're used to make
videos and stuff the main thing I spend
my money on is traveling so that's kind
of like what I budget for I guess and
save for also I'm really lucky that my
dad is really good with finance stuff
but if you don't have a family member
who is I would say search someone out
almost as like a mentor and just go get
coffee with them and stuff I'm trying to
learn about flipping houses because I
think that's definitely something that I
want to do in the near future I'm just
trying to find people to go grab coffee
with and just like learn more about what
they do and how they do it because no
one in my family really flips houses so
if you don't have
someone that's like good with finances
or or something that you feel like you
need to learn more about than just go
find someone and become friends you know
I'm going through like a waterline
eyeliner drought right now half of money
there can't find the ones I like or
they're like not sharpened and they're
just whatever I'm just stamping that
black underneath there Oh something I am
super excited about it always feels so
good after 15 days of foundation is over
to get back into filming like different
kinds of content and I feel like it's
almost good because it gives me like a
refresh button you know it gives me a
refresh button just having new video
ideas and everything it just makes me
really excited again because when you're
filming 15 of the same videos in a row
let me tell you so many different kinds
of videos coming up that I'm really
excited about and I have a few videos I
thought of that I haven't seen done yet
so I hope you guys like him by the way
these matte shades so far have been
really pigmented they've been blended
out really easily I do feel like they
can look a little bit muddy super
pigmented though there are a few
questions about upcoming trips obviously
la is the next one for the Meetup I
actually have like everyone I know and
their mother's visiting Seattle in the
next few months so I'm gonna be like in
major entertainment mode that I'm going
to Chicago in June Nashville in July
probably Tahoe at some point during the
summer and then depending on when I do
that out of country stuff I'm thinking
that's gonna happen in September so I
don't know what I'm doing and obvious
probably just being here and being in
major like filming mode I really want to
do Cuba too there have been some really
good take a deals on Skyscanner I've
been really tempted they had like I
think it was like $400 round-trip
tickets to Tokyo the other day I
literally almost booked it it was for
like the week before the meet up and I
was like I don't want to be totally dead
in LA for that someone on snapchat says
I'm going through a tough breakup right
now with someone who I thought I was
going to marry do you have any advice on
how to get over someone that is rough
I've been there I feel like when I go
back to that place it still hurts but I
think that time definitely helps in that
so cliche but that's really all you can
do is it does get easier and easier
and eventually you'll learn to live life
again without that person in the back of
my mind I truly believe that what's
meant to be will be
you never know and I think the best you
can do is live your life do your thing
and I'm sorry you're going through that
because it is rough I can literally go
back to that place and if you've ever
been there your heart physically hurts
it is the weirdest thing but it
definitely does get so much better you
just have to give it time
also keep busy if you're just sitting
around your house thinking about it that
is the worst go get distracted hang out
with friends do things you like eat food
you like whatever it is that makes you
happy go do that Briana says if you
could collapse and create a product who
would you clap with and what would you
create though besides the one that's
currently whoops currently in the works
I definitely think Physicians Formula
would be up there for me I would love to
create something with Physicians Formula
you guys want to hit them up on twitter
feel free probably a drug store brand BH
Cosmetics I would love to collaborate
with I like a lot of their products
collabs are so cool like if you think
about the fact that just a few years tho
collabs were not a thing with youtubers
and now like major major brands are
working with so many different youtubers
just goes to show you the power of
YouTube and everything but also it's
just insane that like brands and Sephora
industry has changed so much in the last
few years and it's very cool I'm just
like not obsessed with this eyeliner the
Kat Von D one my eye lore 121 season
look like they're almost dead I wear my
lashes so many times before I finally
toss him oh wait these ones might be
good because I think the yellow yeah
let's do these these ones I like because
they're a little bit more separated so
when you have on like an eye shadow that
you want to show through the lashes
these ones are good for that Jody Lynn
on snapchat says I love hearing about
all of your travels and adventures is
there anywhere you won't go or have no
desire to visit I don't think so China
is one of those places that I didn't
have a major desire to visit but I went
there because I had a friend living
there and I loved it like it was a good
trip for me I would never want to live
in China but I really enjoyed my time
there I'm trying to think I think the
only places I wouldn't want to go to are
just like random places in the u.s.
actually ash says please show us what
type of planner you use
I will link the planner I use down below
it's from Amazon and it's not the aran
contra anymore I still really like erin
condren but I really love this when I'm
using I just feel like it's a little bit
I don't know I love how like soft the
pages are it sound like such a planner
nerd right now but they have hella sob
pages very nice pages but I mentioned
and showed it in the video I did all
about time management I love this style
of flash the hooter bands are very thick
but you guys know that doesn't really
bother me like my favorite I'll or
lashes they have a thick band pure
lashes have a thick band if you're not
into thick bands you wouldn't like any
of these definitely not as comfortable
as like the kiss slash bands a kiss faux
mink lashes are so nice back to brand
collapse can I clip on a hot sauce or
burrito
that would be so ideal I'm actually
liking how it's look is coming together
I didn't know where we were headed but
we made it somewhere son keeps going in
and out we have had so many days in a
row of gloominess and rain in Seattle I
feel like this is the longest like a no
sund spell we've had and today is the
first day where it's even like peaking
out for like 30 seconds usually don't
mind this weather at all but it's just
getting to that point where I'm like
alright I'm done I've this lipstick this
is in the shade blogger this is the one
dollar a Oh a studio from shot miss a
just did a whole video testing out their
makeup on try this might be too dark oh
I think that's actually the perfect
shade what I'm going for kind of feel
like a hot dog right now but it's so
weird looking back on like photos and
videos now with my lip ring because I
feel like I didn't see how it looks you
know when you can't see how something
looks on yourself when you've had it for
so long I'm not sure really happy I took
it out I feel like my nose thing is much
more me right now these they're
definitely very drying they feel
actually like exactly like the color pop
matte liquid lipsticks happy with that
shade that was actually like the exact
kind of shade I was going for alright I
think that's everything so everything I
used on my face will be down below I
hope you guys like the shadowing
schmooze and had a good time hanging out
