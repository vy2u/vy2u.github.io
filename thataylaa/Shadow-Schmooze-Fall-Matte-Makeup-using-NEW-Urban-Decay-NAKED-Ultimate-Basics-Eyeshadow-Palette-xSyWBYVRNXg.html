could be a stressful all right so today
we're doing an old-school style
shadow and schmooze video if you're new
here this is where we put on makeup and
talk about life I wanted to sit down and
actually talk to you guys in this video
and then also trying out the Urban Decay
Naked ultimate basics palette which is
kind of the highlight of the video so I
want to show you guys it in action and
do just kind of like a classic fall
matte look so if you want to see my base
for this look like the foundation and
concealer and powder and stuff I used I
did a full video on my drugstore acne
coverage foundation routine so all the
products I used are drugstore I will
link that video down below because I'm
pretty sure it'll be up before this so
if you want to see how I got this look
you're in the right place just keep
watching pretty much where we ended off
is that I set my face so now I'm going
to go in with contour I'm going to try
out this Wet n Wild mega glow contouring
palette this is in the shade dulce de
leche I asked you guys on snapchat what
your favorite contour shades are for
pale skin and a lot of you said this guy
I've been going contour crazy lately
because trying to buy and try out a ton
of different contour shades for you guys
because eventually I'm going to be doing
contour pale skin video I'm going to
talk about the best contour products
anyways and bronzers trying out this guy
I've only swatch this never tried this
favorite contour brush lately has been
this wet and wild one that I actually
got at Dollar Tree it is freaking
amazing supersoft oh yeah not too warm
this is pretty much all the videos you
guys are saying right now are
pre-recorded a couple weeks pretty sure
when this video is going to be going up
I'm going to be in New York oh you guys
are going to be seeing the new hair on
YouTube a couple weeks delayed so if you
want to see what it looks like right now
follow me on Instagram and snapchat I
don't typically like to do my forehead
just what I like lately I've been kind
of just going like this on the side of
my nose
just for a super light not really
contour just to give my face some
dimension kind of blush I definitely
pulled a blush to use where did it go
for reals I've been into more like
peachy warm bronzy kind of blushes
lately so I'm gonna try out this
luminous blush in the shade Tigerlily
this is a very worn G peachy I've never
used this I think i've swatched it but
I've never actually put it on my face I
think these are pretty pigmented so I'm
just going to use a tiny bit start and
I'm going with the morphe 53 brush feel
like this might look a little bit
Orangery on my skin man some of these
brushes are just not as soft it's weird
because it feels soft when you put it on
your hand bonus ash on your face I just
feel like it doesn't feel quite as soft
as the original collection highlight
okay I really failed up pulling product
today for highlight I'm going to use
this etude house secret beam highlighter
a vention acai think in a couple 15 days
foundation videos this is so beautiful
and so underrated pictures is under 8
bucks you can get off of Amazon that's
where I got it and it is so stunning my
favorite highlight brush is the Sigma
fo3
amazing so I just kind of swirl all
these shades and then apply oh my gosh
I've never actually told you guys like
what I'm really doing in New York let me
know if you want me to vlog the entire
time I'm there but basically it look at
that it's going to be a freaking
jam-packed week I'm actually there from
September 30th to October 7th I think
October 6th or 7th so I am there for a
full week I'm super excited for multiple
reasons but I've only been in New York
and actually done New York things one
time and I was pretty young so I'm
excited to actually see it I've thought
about living in New York just for like a
few months just because I think that'd
be fun like subletting my apartment here
and then just renting an apartment there
for a few months I'm feeling the notes
highlight right now so I'm just going to
town by the way so Malory 17:12 and I
are staying with each other for a few
nights we're doing beautycon we're doing
a meet-up with jewel up September 30th
that night we're going to be doing a
meet-up primers Wow I literally failed
at life today I think I actually am
going to add a tiny bit to my brows
today just as I want to do a like full
on I look lately I've been using Mac's
fluid line in the shade past Twilight I
think this might have been a limited
edition
and from like a long-ass time ago I'm
using the morphe e39 which is kind of
like a rounded super stiff I brush is
not intended for eyebrows but I'd like
it because it is very very stiff so I
can kind of get exactly where I want it
okay what was I talking about the
Mallory and I are hanging out for a few
days then once Mallory leaves I'm
actually working on a little something
something which you guys will see in the
next couple months probably
that's super excited about it it's just
like insane to me and then my mom and my
aunt are coming to meet up with me and
we're just gonna have like a vacation
kinda for a few days travel around New
York she has a lot of family there so
we're just like bouncing all over the
place kind of let me know the best
places in New York City to eat I've been
like stopping Instagram lately to find
places oh no the brow struggle I so
dislike brows like it is the one makeup
thing that I genuinely just like
everything else I love brows no sir and
yes I realize the shade is darker than
my hair even when my hair is silver I'm
going to be doing darker brows because
personally I love the way the darker
brows look with lighter hair I think it
looks a little bit adhere or not as like
put together so you know you do you I
realize the shade is dark I'm very
conscious of that thank you for your
concern people love to comment about
brows I think it's because it's one of
those things that people have such
different opinions on like what a good
brow looks like but at the end of the
day you know it ain't your face so
pretty much in my time right now I have
been working my Fanny off not just on
YouTube stuff but work stuff too to get
like all caught up for willing than me
gone but YouTube I have been busting my
balls to get three videos a week ready
say I'm gonna be going to Idaho for like
four days then I have two days here and
then I go to New York I'm pre filming a
bunch of videos foundation Friday
everything I have a little bit of
foundation left over on the palette so
I'm just taking that and I'm going to
carve these out a little bit just to
crisp up those lines on an everyday
basis I have not been wearing any brow
product but when I'm doing a full-on
look I do like to fill in my brows a
little bit for the underneath I'm
actually going to take the NYX eyebrow
base and the shade white just a tiny bit
of this this is awesome if you have pale
skin to help
carve-out because it's literally white
what's new with you guys I really want
to do another Baby Doe sleepover
livestream comment below if you're one
of the og people in the baby doe
sleepovers I used to do if you weren't
there there were live streams there a
good time I love doing live streams
because it's just really fun to get to
talk to you guys and every time I do a
live stream I just feel so much more
connected so I think we're going to be
doing another one soon
I usually let you know ahead of time
when I'm going to be doing it there just
follow me on social and I will let you
know when one is about to go down all
right I feel like I just spent forever
on brows now we're on to eyeshadow
primer I'm used that same white
eyeshadow base from NYX and I'm just
taking this six-plus on your note this
is from things from eBay or something
I'm getting freaking pumped for the next
15 days of foundation I hope you guys
are too
it's November 5th to the 20th I'm
thinking about what foundations I'm
going to do I'm actually going to start
pre filming those right when I get back
from New York because 15 days in a row
of videos is a lot folks I needed like a
full week to de-stress from the last 15
days of foundation but it's awesome
because the time you guys found my
channel from 15 years foundation comment
down below if that's how you found me
and I'm going to take the morphe m5 11
brush and we're going to go in with this
Urban Decay Naked ultimate basics
palette I have been freaking loving this
thing I've used this probably five times
now I've done a few more intense like
smoky looks and then also just some
super basic looks these are super
pigmented super blendable not were they
like blend away if you have the original
basics palette these have a lot more
warm shades actually had a mirror
disaster it's slid between this thing
and I couldn't actually close the
palette so I had to get done and
take it out so I'm not sure what kind of
look I want to do right now but I know I
want to do a metallic lip so kind of
centering that I look around that I'm
going to mix nude and commando right
here this is going to go in the crease
you literally need the tiniest bit of
these because they're very pigmented
what else is new in life life has been
going good guys I'm loving doing
freelance I have so much more
flexibility it has been awesome health
was not
doing so great but trying to live life
best I can
I'm really hoping I'll be okay in New
York and like able to do all the things
I'm planning nothing new in the dating
world I've been really bad and I haven't
even been checking any of the dating
apps I'm just over it you guys like I
just want to meet someone in real life
at this point it's crazy how meeting
someone in real life now is such a crazy
concept like whenever I'm talking to a
couple and they've actually met in real
life it's more shocking than people who
have met on like bubble or tinder it's
crazy and I almost feel like it gives
people excuse like men and women to not
have as much of an urge to go talk to
people in real life because you kind of
have these dating apps as a fallback now
makes me sad for our world but at the
same time I feel like I need to like put
myself out there more in real life
because since I work from home and I'm
not a huge going out person like
clubbing and bars and stuff I really
need to just put myself out there and
like go so that I'm in a situation where
I could potentially meet someone you
know what I mean I'm going to take the
r39 brush and going with this warm burnt
brown shade called extra bitter I guess
is more of like a brick and I'm just
gonna place this really know where where
my placing is right now they typically
don't really think before I put colors
on my eyeballs one time I said that and
someone commented being like you know
you're not putting eyeshadow in your
eyeballs right oh man I'm kind of just
blending this more into the crease to
warm it up a little bit I hope you guys
have been enjoying the videos lately now
that I have a little more time to
dedicate to YouTube I've been trying to
really think through the videos that I'm
putting out and like invest more time
into not just editing but like the
actual content it's more than just
sitting down and filming a lot of it is
like researching different products
ordering those products just thinking
about new video ideas I've also been
trying to post more high-quality photos
on Instagram since I'm usually really
bad about that I just take a photo using
like the snapchat camera and then edit
the crap out of it and post it but I've
actually been using my good DSLR for
Instagram lately and I did order the
iPhone 7 which by time this is going up
hopefully that has arrived that has a
way better camera so I'm hoping that
will make my life easier
for Instagram doing like a slight shadow
right now so I'm just blending this into
the inner part and leaving that middle
portion empty I do have some lash glue
still on my eyelashes that I can't get
off for the life of me I use a new lash
glue yesterday and never again all right
what do I want to do whoo maybe we'll do
matte Brown all over yellows that I
usually have a basket of products I'm
going to used and I pull before I sit
down at film but I think I had like
amnesia during the middle of doing that
today because I don't have like half the
products here that I need I'm gonna take
this brcs 20 brush by Coastal Scents and
I think I'm gonna go in with lockout
which is this matte brown shade right
here and I kind of just want to put this
all over the lid like I said I'm doing a
metallic lip so I think an all night I
could look really cool oh these are so
pretty just blending this right into the
crease colors I just want it to like
fade if you're in your head comparing
these to the to the Naked palette don't
because this is whole new level I'm
gonna go back with the r39 and just take
a tiny bit of that same shade just more
easily blend this right into the crease
okay so this is what the eyes are
looking like debating whether I want to
do winged liner or not right now see
this is what happens with hooded lids
when you go like this it looks totally
good and blended and then when I
actually sad my eye you gotta fix it up
feeling very confused about life right
now I don't know if I want to do a lower
lashline shadow think we are gonna do
that I'm gonna take this la girl glide
gel liner it's my favorite black liner
the only thing is I can't forget sharpen
it right oh this is so not sharp
oh hold up this is the J Kat Velvet
Touch waterproof gel liner I can't
totally tell how is Alone's I already
had a little bit of product on there but
this just blend it on really nice I'm
going to drag this a tiny bit down and
then we're going to blend shadow now I'm
going to take that same brush that I
used for cleaning up my eyebrows first
I'm going to take blackjack which is
just a black shade I'm just going to
kind of stamp this on the eyeliner
underneath the waterline sit on the lace
9:04 brush and we go with that burnt
brick shade again
I'm just kind of smoked out that lower
lashline this lighter shade blow right
here is slightly has like a sheen to it
but it's not enough pop for me for the
inner corner so I'm gonna go in with
makeup geek voltage which is on my
favorite inner corner shades it has this
almost yellowish gold undertone to it
but it's still light enough what the
heck went on in this palette one of the
shadows is totally crumbled this blue
one right here
we shall clean that later but it looks
like voltage is still living we're going
to go in with that Coastal Scents s20
brush and I'm just going to put this a
right on the inner corner then also
bring it down a little bit okay it's
looking super old right now and why it
looks a lot more white like this maybe
it's just next to the other colors that
I like it there we go
I should probably be this close when I
do my eyeshadow next time but this lens
doesn't zoom and I would have to sit on
like 10 pillows to get this angle here's
what the eye shadows looking like so far
I'm still undecided if I want to do top
liner or not I kind of like the look of
the bottom heavy right now so I'm just
gonna put on some mascara to Faced
better than sex this one is actually
pretty dried out right now honestly I
don't even know if I want to put on
falsies right now whenever you don't put
on eyeliner on your top lash line when
you put on mascara it just makes your
lashes look a lot longer because you can
actually see the base of your eyes since
that's drying up a little bit I'm gonna
go in with just one coat of the luminous
superstar mascara by L'Oreal there's a
one side on here which is like a primer
and then a two side I'm just going to
take that two side and just get a little
more lashes going for bottom mascara Wet
n Wild mega length is my ride-or-die
some of you guys have asked if I'm going
to be doing the writer dye tag let me
know if you want to see that I just put
up the Holy Grail drugstore makeup
products and eventually I'm going to do
a play grail high-end products video I
don't know if the writer dye tag is
still necessary but let me know I would
rather do the back-to-school
back-to-school how I wore my makeup in
high school challenge video uneven
for what I use though that's my issue
remember how I did my makeup I just have
absolutely zero recollection of the
products I actually used I literally
remember one Ulta powder that they don't
even make anymore I checked and that's
it wonder if my mom would remember some
reason I am so ready for silver hair you
guys I'm getting over this I think a
super nude could look really good right
now
lipstick wise but I also really want to
use these colour-pop ultra metallic lips
I haven't used either of these but this
one is in the shade flitter and it looks
like this super pretty kind of rose gold
and this one is three-way I'm like a
cranberry red shimmery feeling the red
more yeah so I'm going to take this
color pop lippie pencil in the shade
brink this looks like kind of a brick
red I'm filling this in all the way and
I feel like this color alone is super
pretty ooh I like this shade it's like a
rosy this day feels weird it kind of
feels like it's like 8:00 p.m. right now
but it's really only one o'clock I think
I actually might just leave it like this
because I really like the Matt and Matt
I kind of like it I think we're gonna
leave it I will swatch this one just so
if you guys are curious you could see
this is the shade three-way does look
really pretty yeah it's like a metallic
cranberry and then I'll swatch this one
- this is flitter oh heck yeah this is
so pretty I feel like you could put this
on the eyes that's like a metallic
shadow look at that rose gold alright so
this is the final look I hope you guys
like this video if you did make sure you
give it a thumbs up if you want to see
how I did my face today like I said I
will leave that link down below also in
the little eye thing somewhere over here
love you guys thanks for watching see
you on my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
