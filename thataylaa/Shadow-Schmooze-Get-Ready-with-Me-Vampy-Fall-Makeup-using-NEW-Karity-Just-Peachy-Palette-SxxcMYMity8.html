all right so today we are doing a shadow
and schmooze who is new to shadow in
schmooze let me know down below if this
is your first shadowing schmooze fear
new burrito welcome like I usually start
off videos after 15 days of foundation
with shadow ninja moves because we can
just chat catch up talk about actually
didn't talk about the series at all in
this video I just realized I guess we'll
do that in the wrap-up video or
different shadow in choice I am feeling
full-on in fall mode ready to do this
put me in a pumpkin patch right now if
you enjoy shadow and schmooze videos
don't forget to give this a thumbs up Oh
totally had something I actually had to
tell you I see wrap-up video for 15 days
to Foundation which is where I rank all
of them I've been trying them out this
whole time since those videos were
pre-recorded it gives me more time to
try out the foundations I was supposed
to be on Monday the 25th and instead
that videos gonna be going up Friday the
29th I believe as of now just to give
myself a few extra days to try
everything out I feel like there are
some that I haven't gotten to yet and
others that I've like tried out multiple
times alright let's jump into it if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching it
feels so nice to be sitting down and
just chillin we're gonna film the shadow
and schmooze it's my third can of
coconut look what today I despise this
flavor when I first drank it it tasted
like sunscreen now I'm good as long as I
don't have it with food it is so good I
actually have a ton of new products that
I'm going to do in a first impressions
video a separate video so this stuff
most of it isn't gonna be a first
impression there's some stuff that
actually is but for the most part I'm
just gonna kind of play around with
products I'm probably not gonna hold up
and mention and talk about each product
since we're gonna be talking about other
stuff so be sure to check the
description box if you want to know what
I'm using cuz everything will be down
there I'm gonna go into Smashbox primer
water oh that was not my face I hate the
smell of this stuff but it actually
works and this looks amazing if you have
foundations that look really matte and
cakey so when I'm filming this today
it's actually September 9th 8th
September 8th so that means I'm still
trying out foundation combos so I'm
going to be mixing the Catrice HD liquid
coverage like I just said I'm not gonna
be explaining what I'm doing and here we
go anyways I'm gonna be mixing this with
the Josie Maran vibrancy foundation and
rg5 I feel like this one might help add
some do enos to it and lighten it a bit
so we'll see how it's combo goes I just
went to the dermatologist this morning
and had my
accutane consultation which went really
well I got approved for it so basically
what happens now is there's like a
30-day period that you have to wait you
do a lab test and then they have to get
your results back and then you can go
there again and actually start that
means I'm gonna be starting accutane the
first week of October I do feel like I'm
at the point I'm in my mid-20s now and
I'm just ready to not have acne on my
face like I would love to just go
outside with no makeup on at all no
concealer be able to jump in the pool
for all the pools I jump in whatever go
to the lake whatever it is and just have
no makeup on and not have acne and
scarring and everything so I'm excited
to not have acne and be able to focus on
the scarring and hyperpigmentation
everything once it's gone
you've been on accutane I would love to
hear what products you used for the
dryness and everything like face creams
lip products
whoo that looks nice I've started doing
some research myself as far as what
products to use but I know a lot of you
guys have gone on accutane okay I
definitely put way too much foundation
on this fella I feel like now even when
I'm not doing foundation reviews I
automatically just do half my face what
are you doing out there yesterday I was
at a museum and this piercing that I had
a little gold bvl a piece that totally
fell out like it's totally gone he
changed the bar size on that and I don't
think he snuck it in all the way but
that's okay it happens bro what is going
on up there this person does this at
literally 1:00 a.m. I can't figure out
their timing or what they're doing first
I thought they were going at it and it's
definitely not that because it's at like
weird times when I was living in Israel
at this random dudes apartment that I
found on couchsurfing the people next to
us in that apartment I've never heard
anyone have louder sex in my life it was
like to the point where you're like are
you okay in there like should I actually
go knock on your door and make sure
everything is okay people's bodies are
alive everyone's functioning in the
world oh yeah
pass in the forehead tests with flying
colors also today when I was at the
dermatologist actually had a
consultation for laser hair removal
which I didn't realize you can't do on
accutane because your skin is so
sensitive it would just like fall apart
so if I want to do laser I have to wait
like a year this concealer actually
tried in a different video this is the
Lancome ten Idol ultra where ultra where
yeah holder work but this isn't the show
you
zero nine zero before I use the one hunt
one ten shade I think it was and that
was way dark so I'm hoping ninety ivory
is better Oh feel super creamy very
moisturizing has a nice coverage too
it's funny the longer you have lash
extensions on the more reckless you
become like the first few days I'm
always so cautious and I'm just like
putting concealer all over everything I
think I'm gonna get a fill right before
I leave I also need to get my eyebrows
waxed desperately okay that concealer it
looks very beautiful if you like kind of
a dewy moisturizing creamy formula this
is really pretty I'm curious how this is
gonna set though because usually with
ones like this when I put a powder on
top it gets kind of too cakey I might
actually let it kind of set down a
little bit before I set my under eyes
not bad actually oh that actually looks
really nice I like that concealer use a
cargo blue-ray powder
I'm taking the pure nada contour palette
palette powder and alluring this was in
the etsy video and I ended up ordering
the full-size I freaking love this such
a pretty shade I'm trying it with a new
brush I haven't used it with this
brushes by Smashbox oops wait this is
really pigmented I just forgot that you
need like a dab of this this is kind of
like a duo fiber brush but like a little
bit more stiff such a good color I'm
also gonna try this brush with the same
powder and see if I can like dust this
on my temples I'm going in with a makeup
forever blush I've been obsessed with
this shade this brush is kind of
surprising me like this is not a brush I
would typically reach for since it's so
flimsy but it's blending everything
really pretty the one you guys are
seeing this yeah I'll be gone and it'll
be fall maybe when does fall officially
start I don't know but it'll be like the
end of September so I feel like I kind
of want to do like a fall I shadow kind
of look oh I wanted to try this out so
this is the girl on meteorites pearls
I've heard so much about these over the
years I've just never tried them because
they're so freakin expensive I ended up
sending these this packaging is really
pretty whoa
it's like ceramic or something no it's
not certain like it's like a kid I'm
just gonna dig into these balls kind of
powdery very very subtle but like is
anything on my face it's like not even
knack next to nothing powder subtle this
is like actually can't tell if
anything's don't know much ace I don't
see anything
this is how my grandma's bathroom used
to smell I don't know how I feel about
those I don't think very good instead
I'll use this highlight I've also been
really loving this another makeup
forever ones is light pink one this
highlight are actually any highlight
with the setting spray I'm gonna use
makes it freakin pop where is it this is
one of those products that I really
couldn't tell how I felt about it for a
few weeks and I've been using this for a
while now this is the Too Faced hangover
RX three and one primer spray I think I
use this in a first impressions or
shadowing schmooze or something and I do
like this for underneath my makeup but I
love it for over my makeup I feel like
it may
my skin look dewy it definitely makes
your highlight pop and it actually makes
your makeup stay on longer I feel like
it really does whoa look at that
concealer I just noticed that it's
probably been there this whole time I
also like mixing in a little bit of the
gold one which it's weird because I
usually don't like gold but this one
actually it works it looks way lighter
on the face I'll have the exact color
down below cuz I can't get this thing
out right now but I'm just gonna like
add a little bit of that gold in there
like that watch the magic happen
hopefully this shows up on camera just
like imagine yourself on a tropical
beach while this is drying because
that's where I'm going with the lash
extensions I've been just using the same
brush that I use for the concealer to
get around my nose ring this is Kat Von
D number 40 by the way I don't okay I
like how I totally shot on this brush
when I first got it and now it's like
actually kind of useful since I'll be in
London I was debating doing a trip right
afterwards from there since flights are
so much cheaper but it just didn't work
out with timing of stuff cuz I'm
actually going to one of my best
friend's weddings from college in
October so it just would have been
cutting it too close with working and
traveling and everything but I'm super
excited for her wedding I need to get a
dress I already have her present figured
out I love present scheming shaming I'm
excited for her to see it she's probably
watching this yes this one is actually a
first impression I've never used this
but I did just swatch it and it looks
beautiful so I'm excited to put this on
my eyes this is the caridy Just Peachy
palette look at all these fall colors
hate when I have to pee so bad during
filming if you didn't know because I
haven't mentioned them in a while but it
still holds true caridy eyeshadows are
one of my favorite eye shadows they're
beautiful formula they're very similar
to Mac actually did a whole video
comparing Mac shadows to Keira D and the
only reason why I haven't been using
this lately is because I was traveling
with this like that says something if
you travel with a pellet or whatever
this one actually totally broke so I
need to clean this i swatched yummy
which was like actually the last one i
swatched because I just wasn't drawn to
this one at all but out of all the
shimmer shades this shade yummy right
here was like whoa it looked so
beautiful swatch so I kind of use that
actually first as a transition I'm going
to
the P Renata same contour I'm gonna put
warm-and-fuzzy into the crease it's not
super orange shade who that is pigmented
guys the amount of stuff that I edit out
where I'm like what the heck did I just
talk about for three minutes that
probably no one on this planet would
even understand what I'm saying I'm like
procrastinating by just blending because
I still don't know what I'm doing wait
think I got it I think we're gonna go
and with sliced up on the lid what else
is new I've been obsessed with Quantico
I watched Quantico first finish that and
then started watching blacklist and if
you're gonna watch those shows
definitely watch blacklist first because
it's kind of like my Portland Seattle
comparison if you're gonna visit Seattle
and Portland go to Portland first
because Seattle's so much better it's
like that with Quantico and blacklist I
feel like by watching blacklist after
you can predict everything the main
character is kind of an idiot she's no
Alex Parrish still like it like I'm
addicted to it too if an average human
being watching can predict what's gonna
happen before a supposed FBI agent
there's a little something wrong there
I've also been watching bachelor in
paradise when you guys are seeing this
it will be over bright now there's just
the season finale left dude I have so
many thoughts I could do a whole
Bachelor Paradise like word vomit thing
because as much and as horrible at
the show The Bachelor is like I'm
totally on the same page with you there
i watch it for entertainment value not
for like believing you know a hundred
percent of the things are not scripted
and all that good stuff
but it is entertaining and there's
actually some interesting lessons that
can be learned from it I feel like by
the way I'm taking organic I'm just
blending that into the crease and
bringing it down into the inner corner a
little bit and I'm gonna take Atlanta
just blend that right on top a little
bit higher I think ooh that shade is
pretty
I want to wet that same shade and go
back in and like Pat it right on the lid
again this wet and wild brush is sitting
right here so maybe I'll use that I'm
gonna blend that Atlanta shade I've been
really enjoying lining my lower lash
line lately with black liner like really
smoking it out and I'm gonna go in with
organic
okay let's do some liner there's a lot
of dry shampoo of my hair right now
can't find my normal waterline eyeliner
so I'm going to try the colour-pop one I
can't remember if I like the black one
for my waterline or not I'll smudge that
out but it's not the blackest black but
doing the job so to blend that out I'm
going to take the shade fruity right
here just like a deep purpley brown glow
up in here swatched super pretty so I'm
excited to use this I'm gonna put this
on the waterline not the waterline the
inner corner oh hell yeah okay just to
get fall vibes in full force I'm gonna
go on with the wet and wild don't be a
plum plum liquid lipstick hey this is
the first time you guys are seeing
lipstick put on without the lip ring in
I probably should have used a lip liner
with this one because I forgot this
applicator is a little bit tricky with
the dark colors I feel like I need a
little something like right here so I
think I'm actually gonna use an orange
shimmer shade from this palette or like
one of the coppery ones maybe princess
could be pretty okay actually going in
with totally sweet there we go alright I
think this is a final look but I hope
you guys enjoyed the shadows mousse
I had fun whenever 15 days of foundation
is over it's always fun for me because I
can start filming different kinds of
stuff again if you enjoyed this video
and you want shadow and schmooze to
continue don't forget to give this a
thumbs up I love you guys thanks for
watching
see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
