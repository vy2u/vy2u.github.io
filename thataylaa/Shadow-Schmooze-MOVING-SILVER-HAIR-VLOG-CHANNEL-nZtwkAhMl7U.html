challenge okay nothing over the light if
you're new here this is where I put on
makeup and talk about life this is also
apparently where we have half an eyelash
hanging off the entire video so this is
me realizing it at the very end of
filming I tried out a new eyelash glue
which clearly went really well so here
we go whoops last few shadow and shmooze
videos which I have a whole playlist if
you want to go and watch them last few
ones I've done kind of like Q&amp;amp;A style
this one I just have a shit-ton to talk
to you guys about life updates and
things going on so just kind of rambled
this video is probably going to be how
long so grab snack grab some coffee
let's do it I am so excited for this
video it feels so frickin good to be
sitting here and filming a different
kind of video I love 15 days of
foundation and I know you guys are sad
so I feel bad being happy but actually
for a month
I've been focused on that kind of
content so if we've done in my office
space which I'm going to tell you guys
about but I have everywhere in my
room in my apartment right now I didn't
think about the metal thing being a
frame but actually it's really cool
right there I'm kind of feeling it I've
already washed and I moisturize my face
using this product I haven't used this
before this is the new urban decay rehab
makeup prep I wanted to put it on
off-camera because I gave it a few
minutes to set into my skin but this is
super lightweight it's a gel formula
totally set into my skin in about a
minute really don't want to pin back my
hair right now because I'm having a good
bangs day you know people throw out
their hair in a ponytail or bun and then
take it out and it looks perfect mine
has like 5,000 kinks in it all right
what am i doing so I actually want to do
Wolfe falling over in the strip I'm
actually going to do my eyes first today
I don't know why I posted a poll on
Twitter to see what kind of look you
guys want to see in this shadow inch
mousse and surprise me one so thanks for
that but few of you guys and the replies
wanted to see the royal blue makeup look
that I wore in my last revision rejects
video there's also the look that was in
the intro of all my 15 news foundation
videos so I'm going to attempt to
recreate that I'm going to go in with
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot alright where
do I even start right now I have so much
to talk about
let's start out with what's going on in
May so when you guys are seeing this I
will be leaving for China I'm going to
be in China from May 1st to the 15th
we're actually going to China and Taiwan
for those of you who don't know those
Media is not easily accessible in China
the friend I'm staying with has a VPN so
when I did this look originally I used
the urban decay naked ultimate basics
palette I've been using that so much
lately that I figured I'd try out the
tartlet palette today it has really
similar shades super cool tone shades
and I've used this a few times now right
now I'm still leaning towards the Urban
Decay palette I like it a little bit
better and we going to shoot for some
nature right here after I filmed this
today I'm actually going to get eyelash
extensions so I think I'm going to vlog
that but anyways China so don't think
I'm going to have easy access to my
social media in China my friend said I
could use his computer if I needed to
but I guys will still see videos going
up because I'm pre-recording them right
now
I'm just not gonna be able to respond to
comments all the brushes and products
I'm using will be down below so if I
don't mention something check the
description box I'm going to go on to
shade power player right here so when
I'm filming this video right now it's
actually April 20th so I have 10 days
right now to pre-record 8 videos and get
them all edited and uploaded kind of
stressin going to China because my
friend's getting his master's there and
I figured that's one of those places
that China's not really on the top of my
list of places to see so probably
wouldn't go right now if he wasn't there
so I figured I know impromptu trip to
China why not doing like kind of a halo
I am bringing this into the inner corner
bit and then Taiwan just looks unreal
I'm really excited for Taiwan I think I
am gonna vlog China I don't know we'll
see I kind of want to just unplug and I
feel like I really need that right now
but at the same time I want to document
China so I wrapped up 15 days of
foundation in my time yes I yesterday
yeah the 19th whoa so this is the day
after nice thing about using tape is
that you don't even have to think I'm
literally just blending on top of the
tape right now you get back from China
to Taiwan on May 15th and then I have
two days in Seattle and then I go to
Portland I'm super excited because
Mallory
Keegan and I are taking a trip to
Portland I get to be a third wheel story
of my life Mallory and Keegan are
actually really fun too third wheel with
though if you don't know who I'm talking
about you should all be subscribed to
Mallory's channel it's Mallory 1712 I
was like my best YouTube friends she's
just an amazing person in human being in
general I went to visit them in Houston
a few months ago and we were like we got
to plan our next trip I've been to
Portland
I love Portland but it's kind of like
the less great version of Seattle
everyone says if you want to live in
Portland you have to live in Portland
first and then Seattle because if you go
backwards so yeah it was just the best
just kidding again if Portland has
really good food I will give it that I'm
gonna go with the black shade in here I
haven't used this black shade yet it's
like it has some fallout not going to
bring it up super someone use a
different brush to blend that out we're
going to be in Portland for a few days I
need to come back here and work and then
Mallory is actually going to come back
to Seattle and then her and I are going
to something super exciting that we got
invited to I don't want to talk about it
yet just because I haven't gotten the
full confirmation things in my hand I
don't want to mention it if it falls
through for whatever reason but I'm
pretty sure it's a go pretty much in
Seattle for a total of like three or
four nights in May so May is going to be
freaking crazy it's going to be really
fun I'm stoked so I'm a ton of work
to get done before then ooh I like this
black okay so I'm going to use that same
brush to blend for me the cubes black
eyeshadow when you do a smokey eye is to
not overly blend because it can look
really muddy blending it's like taking
my full concentration right now here's
someone who has fitted eyelids a bit
like I do I like to just let my eyes
relax so I can see how far to bring this
up when I'm just looking normal not like
this Mallory also just launched her own
jewelry line which I'm so proud of her
for if you haven't visited her shop yet
you should go do it at 1712 shop calm
man tape does make life really easy just
to make the blue shade really pop I'm
going to go with this NYX white
eyeshadow base and I just use my finger
and put that right on a center where I'm
going to put the blue okay so let's talk
about the office when I post it on
snapchat showing you guys moving out of
there and on Twitter I got a defendant
questions about why I'm leaving the
office already and if you haven't seen
it I did a full office tour which I
explained in that office tour video that
I was going to be moving out of there
for a few different reasons main
reasoning for getting an office space
was to have a place to film outside of
my bedroom I have a roommate in this
apartment and I film in my bedroom we're
currently in my bedroom
hence the bed I do YouTube as a job I
also do freelance digital marketing
consulting I basically wanted a space
for work that was outside of my room it
gets really exhausting when you work in
the same place that you sleep for the
blue shadow I use this shade from the BH
Cosmetics foiled palette
look at that blue this foiled eyeshadow
palette
is totally underrated the h-has medics
have some good products I feel like
they're not talked about as much okay
this is one where shadow insurance
videos they're like 45 minutes long
because I can't talk to do this shirt at
the same time and basically what I
learned is that with filming you guys
don't see this because they never really
show it on snapchat or anything but
being on YouTube for almost five years
now get a lot of PR packages there are a
lot of products to go through and put
places is basically having to move boxes
and stuff back and forth every time I
filmed the time I got over there set up
the lighting everything whole filming
process would take an extra two to three
hours to film which I don't have that's
valuable time for me on top of it being
just an extra pain in the ass and taking
longer there was major construction
going on now I think it's ending anytime
soon so I would literally have to stop
in the middle of filming
I'm not kidding probably thirty to fifty
times I could have done what I did in
five hours or six hours in the office in
two and a half hours here so it just
didn't make sense
I loved the actual space I had a
ton of room it was great the rent was
fairly good for Seattle just didn't work
out which is fine because I think that's
something that I would have tried at
some point getting a different office
space now I know for filming especially
it is so much easier to have everything
just in your apartment yesterday in my
time I actually moved everything I was
office space I still need to like go
there and what's called speckle speckled
the walls filling out the holes
never speckled before so that'll be fun
so I got the drill took everything down
movers came all the stuff is in my
apartment right now so my apartment is
like stacked but it won't be going to
waste because I'm actually other new
news moving apartments hold on what am i
doing right now when I go back in with
power player that like topi kind of gray
shade and just blend out that blue but
it was going to be how long until
already or as I just going with what I
was saying what was agent things I've
been in Seattle for almost three years
now I've been in this department for
almost two years basically what I
realized is with what I do for a living
I need to have a bigger apartment I need
to have a space where I can work in my
apartment so after weighing out all of
my options and I really love having a
roommate I like having someone to talk
to since I work by myself for space and
everything it just didn't make sense so
I'm actually getting my own apartment
moving into a one-bedroom apartment in
Seattle in a different area and I'm
really excited because it's really close
to where a couple good friends live base
is going to be in walking distance from
Rach which will be really
is my best friend we were roommates in
college it'll be really good to be in
walking distance to her it's gonna be
super fun pretty much going to be using
the living room space as like my filming
and office space and she doesn't have a
couch and everything but it's going to
be mainly used for works as long as I
can keep my bedroom for relaxing in the
living room for working I think we
should be good really these eyes are
taking me ten times longer than usual
because I'm talking if you want to bring
actually a tiny bit of the black on the
inner corner I feel like I need a little
more something-something so moving out
of this apartment and into the new
apartment I actually don't even know
when it's happening right now I'm pretty
sure it's going to be end of June or
beginning of July let me know if you
guys want to see like moving vlogs or
something do you have an apartment tour
on the place I'm in right now we need to
wrap up these guys going back in with
that force of nature shade blending that
up into the crease just add some warmth
so this new apartment is new it's
beautiful it's in an awesome area and
I'm just excited for a new journey I
guess I didn't think I was going to be
living by myself for a while do I want a
detail yes I'm doing my foundation so is
so satisfying seeing the crisp line I
just really need to pluck my eyebrows we
all know I'm horrible at that it is what
it is some more important things to
worry about in life oh look at that line
nothing like it alright that was one of
the more satisfying things I've ever
done I still want to use tape every day
it's almost fallen over this chair ten
times now I'm excited to show you guys
this primer because I've been using it
in and out of filming for 15 days I've
been really liking this someone
recommended this to me in the comments
it's the high mode matte twelve twelve
hour visible oil blocker it has a really
interesting feel to it it can kind of
get bali if you use too much or if you
put it on right after your moisturizer
so you really have to give your skin a
few minutes i just use a tiny amount i
don't put this all over my face i just
put this right where i get oily i don't
know i think it actually does something
wait this is going on nicer than usual
on top of that moisturizer i feel like
it's a totally different feel to it you
get this on Amazon Urban Outfitters also
carries it for some reasons but it was
cheaper on Amazon so that's where I got
it I also want to use this Urban Decay
rehab makeup prep lick love just like a
lip primer the shea butter and coconut
oil so I'm selling a bunch of my
furniture oh my god smell the balm but
it smells like the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer I usually hate scented
lip products if it's not minty but
coconuts like the
the other cent I can do on my lips ooh
this feels nice you've seen my decor
right now in my living room probably
just from snapchat I don't think I have
any videos in there so like Gray's was
kind of like darker in there with pops
of green I want to do white more
bohemian bright I feel like my apartment
right now is a freaking cave because not
a whole light comes in I was one of my
main things and I was looking for
apartments was like I want something
with a ton of natural light not only for
filming but I really feel like since I'm
in my house so much it just just really
affects me not having light since I'm
filming this right during the middle of
me trying out the foundations for the
wrap-up video you guys will have already
seen the 15 days of foundation wrap-up
video but I'm going to try out the
dermablend smooth liquid camo today and
I'm gonna try mixing it in with the
Urban Decay all nighter because this is
light and it's pink and it has good
coverage this one is too dark yellow but
it has a really nice skin like look to
it I don't really love this one on its
own at all I need to watch this bunch
I'm going to try out the Stiletto Beauty
sponge my morphe this has like a super
pointed thing on the end you know tried
one or maybe two of the other morphe
sponges and I haven't been totally in
love with them but I'm gonna give this
one a go and go go and go what this okay
I got way squishier this feels really
nice and squishy
does anyone else think of Finding Nemo
when you say squishy I'm just mixing
these half-half whoo this sponge feels
really nice way better than I was
expecting
I'm not a huge fan of the Beauty Blender
I don't get the best coverage from the
Beauty Blender I love my Real Techniques
sponge I also love the pure cosmetic
sponge I wouldn't be putting concealer
obviously underneath my eyes so I'm just
going to bring it up to about there I'm
liking this combo looks still really
skin-like because the dermablend I'm
getting vom coverage I actually haven't
used that Urban Decay foundation in
forever looking really ghostly right now
but it all looks normal once I have
everything else on yesterday unpacked
all the makeup and stuff from the office
base feels so good to have everything in
one place I can actually use different
products now and see everything easier
into this sponge I'm going to try and
use this point outside I think for
concealer I don't usually like blending
out concealer with sponges because for
some reason on my skin it takes away the
coverage shade is still looking a bit
yellow that dermablend foundation is
super yellow but sitting on my skin
beautifully okay
that's what the foundation concealer me
is my
heart shape shape something is already
oxidizing because now my face looks a
little bit dark so this might look a
little bit like the concealer that was
too masculine I don't have a lot of
control with this point though we can I
got a maneuver it like I still prefer
blending out my concealer with my morphe
G 38 brush set the under eyes I've been
taking a mix of stargazer and my Laura
Geller double take baked powder I don't
know if I want to set my face I really
like the finish right now if I do I'm
probably Musa Laura Geller since that
one's more pink toned I'm looking a
really yellow right now so I think I am
going to set my face with the lor Geller
I'm gonna do brows off camera because I
can't do that and talk at the same time
I'll be right back with Brad Zaun
alright browser on I use my normal two
brow products will be down below I think
I'm going to try out a new liquid liner
today this is the Catrice glamour doll
super black liner never try this it
looks like it has a nice fine point on
it so this could go really well or
really not well I've been loving the
Catrice ghoulia Mendell mascara I've
been putting it on after the Too Faced
for uh born of a two-phase breath and
sex mascara and it is amazeballs
the nice thing about using Cape is that
you already have that line there so you
can literally just follow that with your
winged liner so far so good with this
eyeliner I'm going to try out a
different eyeliner for my waterline -
this is a Smashbox always on gel liner -
my favourite black liner for the
waterline is a couple bucks it's by la
girl to glide on gel liner not super
easily just consciously to not open my
mouth when I do this very well using my
9:04 brush by sturdily so I'm going to
blend down some black shadow so
something I want to get your guy's
opinion on that I've been thinking about
is I know for a fact that I want to do
more travel content I want to do other
types of content besides makeup it's
because I feel like there's a lot of
other stuff that I'm also passionate
about I'm just been trying to figure out
do I want to put that on my main channel
or do I make a separate vlog channel my
main hesitation with making a second
channel right now is that I feel like I
would be really hard on myself to keep
up with like normal posting I really
just don't have the extra time to do
that with a second channel I do really
want to make other kinds of content too
so I'm gonna go in with that first shade
force of nature again and blend this
right under that black I kind of figure
if there's ever a video that you don't
want to see that's posted to this chain
you just won't watch right and I don't
know that's what I do when I watch
YouTube before I do falsies and finish
up my eyes I'm going to do the rest of
my face I've been really liking this
bronzer this is the MU a bronze
perfection matte in sunset tan as a
perfect color not to oranjee not too
deep I picked this up when I was in
London but I'm pretty sure you can sign
this online love it let me know if you
guys are interested in seeing vlogs
travel blogs local kind of content I
want to do like Seattle stuff like best
places to see in Seattle to put that on
this channel or make a separate channel
let me know the Sigma X 15 it's going to
put a little bit of this on my temples
one of my favorite blushes which I
rediscovered when I was organizing all
the makeup yesterday is the L'Oreal True
Match blush missin flush guys I need to
definitely throw this away like I've had
this star since I started my youtube
channel
don't tell anyone I got some Dollar Tree
years ago just has the prettiest plush
it really is like a slush one of my most
asked questions is what happened to
silver hair am I still trying to go
silver no that is a lost cause guys my
hair was so dead long story short I
actually didn't know I was going to be
dyeing my hair back to black on the top
when I went into the salon to get the
extensions I thought it was going to be
like a black at the roots - great -
silver kind of thing but it ended up
being like my whole head of real hair
went back to black so that was kind of
unintentional but I actually loved it
and feel like so much more myself with
black hair I would have tried gray
silver hair at some point never made it
to silver hair after all that my hair
was just so damaged so fried it was kind
of like the point of no return I think
I'm going to try this elf baked
highlighter and moonlight pearls I'm
remembering correctly this is one of
those that kind of to wipe off the top
layer to really get to the product
typically with baked products like this
it's better to do that
I do have extensions they're like dark
blue right now but the great thing about
extensions is that you can change out
the color as much as you want because
it's not your real hair so it's
highlight very subtle one of my favorite
highlighters of life is the elf
illuminating palette very subtle I don't
know if that's the look I'm going for
right now with blue eyeshadow actually
going to take a mix of these two shades
right here to top off my highlight and
get it really pop in there
go not playing around now that's what
I'm talking about
think it's lost last time but in that
video with the blue eyeshadow look I'm
pretty sure I was wearing pure bombshell
lashes the pure lashes have been my
absolute favorites past couple months
but I wanted to switch it up and use the
aisle or number 121 switch it up I
always use these two these have one more
use to them it looks like and I kind of
just want to finish them off these have
a pretty similar look to the bombshell
lashes I like the band better on the
pure cosmetics ones these ones are
pretty sick Tyler lashes so I'm going to
a thin coat of mascara pull up on these
lashes put on some body mascara and I
will be right back okay so lashes are on
I freaking love these lashes every time
I put them on I forget how much I love
them these are beautiful drugstore
lashes for prom or if you have any kind
of special events coming up or she can
do my bottom mascara on camera because I
have ridges with I have this new mascara
I want to try out it's a triple threat
slim line mascara I haven't looked at
the one yet and spoke to your cosmetics
but by the name of it I'm thinking it's
like a lower lash kind of mascara I
usually use my Wet n Wild mega length
mascara it's my favorite who is a really
skinny tube look at that wand I feel
like it doesn't grip the lashes quite as
well as the one will make length but it
gives you kind of like a feathery
natural look like it
milos feel really nice and moisturize
from that lip priming thing but not to
the point where I couldn't put like a
liquid lipstick on it feels like it
absorbed into my lips which is good this
is the lip combo is wearing in that
video this is my favorite nude lip
combination Sephora probably stop
talking Sephora liquid lipstick in 32
mixed with wet and wild nudie patooty 32
is a little bit more pinky toned and
then putting nudie patootie over top
gives it like a cool toned look and then
just to define the outside of my lips a
bit more I'm going to take the Rimmel
0:32 innocent liner this is perfection
with this combination I'm a more of my
putting this not on my eyeballs I think
some of the highlight that I use like
fell onto my lips are something I
actually liked how that looked so I
think I'm going to go back in with that
pink eye shadow right there and just dab
a little bit of this on my lips oh yeah
I think that's everything
are we done
that was not quick I've been filming
this for two hours time flies when
you're having fun
