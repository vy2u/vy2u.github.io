essentially take a shower when I put on
my setting spray personal preference all
right so today we have a shadow inch
moves on look I'm wearing right now if
you're new to my channel these are where
we sit down and put makeup on our face
and just talk about whatever I'm feeling
I feel like it's been a hot minute since
I sat down and filmed a challenge news
video shatters news videos are my
favorite videos to film so if you guys
also enjoyed them and you want to see
more of them let me know by giving this
video a thumbs up or commenting down
below hang out a ton of new products in
this video some BH Cosmetics stuff a Too
Faced holiday palette talking about my
current favorite foundation routine and
yeah some good stuff
I finally filmed a tutorial on my curly
hair routine so that'll be up after this
video I think so if you want to see how
I got this look and hear my thoughts on
these products you're in the right place
just keep watching all right I'm very
excited for today's video we have tons
of exciting products and I'm just like
in a good filming mood right now let's
do this I always use a body shop teacher
you pore minimizer I swear this stuff
helps with my acne as well and then on
top of that I put the Laura Mercier
foundation primer I am like where you
falling in love with this stuff this is
one of my favorite primers and it just
helps to like completely smooth your
skin and make your makeup stay on all
day so I put that on top of the body
shop one still getting over this cold so
if I sound stuffy that is why so this is
going to be my like I go to kind of
foundation routine lately I'm going to
be mixing the a cosmetic CC cream this
is Bill luma nating one in the shade
fair and this is too dark on its own but
this is such a great CC cream full
coverage it does have like I don't
personally notice the sparkles in it but
some people do say that they see like
full-on sparkles I don't notice that in
this but they do have a non illuminating
version if you don't want to be
sparkling then I'm mixing it with the
brand new Make Up For Ever Ultra HD I
was not a fan of their HD foundation at
all I don't get the hype about it
lightest shade was like pure orange on
me way too dark and the consistency of
it and everything I just like didn't
understand but this guy I really like
mixing with other foundations because it
is super pale if you have pale skin and
you're even lighter than me
it you could use this on its own it is
light coverage so I don't like using it
by itself I'm going to be doing a whole
review on this foundation coming up but
my favorite ways to mix it in with
foundations that are too dark and I just
put one pump of each on the back of a
pallet and just mixing it up I'm just
gonna dab it on all time favorite
foundation brush you guys know is the
Sigma f80 - I might have a coupon code
I'll leave it down below if I do but
this just gives the best coverage out of
any foundation brush it's super dense
it's just my favorite I've had this same
brush for years now four years five
years still doesn't shed they just last
forever and they're really great quality
so that's one thin layer I usually go
back in and just dab on my spots that
need extra concealing afterwards it just
cleaned my foundation brushes last night
for the first time and I don't even want
to tell you how long why is that always
like the dreaded task it's like folding
your clothes but worse I just filmed a
tutorial on my curly hair that you guys
have been asking for that'll be up after
this video you can see how luminous and
dewy the skin looks I love it I'm going
to go in just on a couple spots to give
a little bit more coverage I tried to
turn the brightness down for you guys it
actually isn't like the settings on my
camera aren't too bright
I'm just so pale but under the light and
with my camera on sometimes you can't
actually see what I'm doing so let me
know what you guys think of the lighting
here and I'm throwing it back to like
freshmen or sophomore year of college
this is the covergirl and Olay simply
ageless eye concealer in the shade 205
so you should be my favorite under-eye
concealer I use this every single day
and I just found it in my drawer again
this is what I've been using every
single day again lately and god it's
just freaking great but nor heard any we
went with going too much I've never
heard anyone talk about this before and
it gives good coverage it doesn't crease
at all if you have a problem with
creasing
try this stuff out I don't know if they
discontinued the 205 shade but I went to
double-check at the drugstore and I
couldn't find this in 205 I don't know
if mine was just out of it but 205 is
light enough for me they might have it
on eBay or something but yeah this is
from like years ago which is probably
not great to put on your face but
whatever look at the difference anyways
this is from years ago so I don't even
know if they make the same formulation
of this anymore
I'll buy a new one to test out for you
guys before I like mention it and razan
rejects video just make sure that you
can purchase it my concealer has never
looked like so flawless at the end of
the day just to brighten up the rest of
my face I like to put a tiny bit of this
on the center of my face down the bridge
of my nose and on my chin next step you
can probably guess Physicians Formula I
mentioned this in every single shuttle
schmooze video and I just like to set
the under-eye with this especially with
this concealer it literally looks like
flawless mostly going to put this on the
center of my face to lighten it up a
little bit and then my 10 today I'm
going to be using a setting powder for
the rest of my face I don't do this
every day but I actually have a long
freaking day ahead of me today so I am
going to set my foundation this is the
Too Faced primed and poreless powder I
don't think I've ever talked about this
in a video this is one of my favorite
powders it really does work makes your
stay makes your stay on makes your
foundation stay on so I just put a
little bit in the lid and I'm going in
with my a cosmetics powder brush we're
just going to go to town
it does get everywhere but it's just so
finely milled that you can see it
doesn't take away all the luminosity but
it just helps to set everything problems
don't want to be like taking a big
breath as you put this on your face like
a lot of translucent powders it does
cast a major white cast and photos so
I've been thinking about doing like a
drugstore Bridal makeup tutorial let me
know if you guys would want to see that
I know how many of you guys are getting
married let me know down below if you're
getting married soon or if you're
engaged and how you guys met so I can
just creep on all of your stories okay
brows what are we doing
so I have this new brow product that I
want to try out this is the BH Cosmetics
Studio Pro brow palette for back shades
and then eight powder shades and this is
like ridiculously cheap so I want to try
this out as like a drugstore or like
cheap alternative played around with it
last night a little bit but just when my
makeup was like all off and I just
wanted to see how it worked
nice spoolie through I don't think we're
gonna use brow gel today just because I
want to see how it works what so there's
a black shade and a brown shade so I'm
gonna start out with this brown gel one
see how this works
usually with gel products like this you
kind of want to wipe off the waxy top
layer and really get in there too many
things on here I think I might have got
too much we'll see
OOP I usually clean up the brows with
concealer so don't worry if we're
getting out the lines a little bit the
shade has some red in it but not like
too much I feel like I think we're going
to go in with this taupey brown shade
for it just because I feel like those
colors always kind of pull a little bit
darker I'm just going to run this
through let's go in a little rogue brows
are done I'm definitely happy with this
thing so far we'll see how long it lasts
throughout the day but so far so good
the wax shades were really easy to work
with creamy but not like too creamy
where there's light and all over the
place a shade I really like actually
it's not too red I'm gonna prime the
eyes with Mac's painterly paint-pot mine
is almost fully gone / dried up so I
just ordered the soft ochre one it's my
favorite eye primer ever invented if you
don't have a Paint Pot by Mac you need
it I was going to put a little bit of
this on the lower lash lines at a
contour i sculpt a face palette it's
just the best guys it's just the best if
you haven't gotten this yet and you have
pale skin what are you doing I go in
with this shade every single day and
it's amazing a good a little contour
going for blush I'm going to be trying
out the BH Cosmetics pink perfection
this was a breast cancer awareness
product leave a link for all the
products down below this comes with four
super pretty shades I've used
one of these so far and it was super
pigmented since these are really
pigmented I'm going to be taking a
stippling brush this one is by eight
cosmetics and it's like an angled
stippling brush which is great for
applying blush I think we're going to
take this peachy ish one right here I've
been feeling the peaches lately go to
town well super pigmented even with the
stippling brush I'm just going to put
some of the product over here oh yeah
can't tell if it's too dark right now
guys the struggle that goes into making
a YouTube video like if you guys saw the
behind the scenes for what happens
before you even turn on a camera it's a
little cray God bless people who have
boyfriends or husbands to like autofocus
on their face you are a lucky woman for
highly I'm going to be using the Luke
see Beauty bombshell highlight and I
haven't actually used this one before I
thought it might be a little bit too
dark for my skin tone because it's this
like kind of row I'm not even rose gold
like a gold highlight shade then I
swatch it on my hand this morning and I
think it might work you would need the
tiniest bit of this highlighter because
it's super pigmented and why are you
getting dark I'm right here
cheekbones ooh heck yeah super pretty
gold highlight oh man you guys see that
oh yeah it's like a highlight gasm right
now
okay this is beautiful I don't have
champagne pot but this is how I imagined
it I'm gonna run a tiny bit of that down
the bridge of my nose and Cupid's bow as
well alright so before I make up is
usually the point where I apply my
setting spray this is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro makeup setting spray is
my favorite setting spray ever invented
on planet earth I like to essentially
take a shower when I put on my setting
spray personal preference it just helps
to make the powder look less powdery
your makeup lasts all day
all right so for eyes today I have a
couple different well this is like
magnetized on my table okay so for us
today I have a couple different palettes
I want to try out BH Cosmetics nude rose
is basically supposed to be like a ah I
don't know
look at it I tried this out last night
just like playing around but I wanted to
try it with like a primer and like
actually do a look with it and then be
two-faced this is their holiday palette
I'm not actually sure what this is
called there's no name on it own you're
pretty maybe this is what looks like
beautiful beautiful colors I've been
using this one almost every day and
dreams up here which is like this matte
mauve color super pretty time I start
with the Too Faced palette and use the
shade reindeer as a transition shade
and just blend that all into the crease
I have a video call later so I don't
know how intense this look is going to
get X I'm going to go in with the BH
Cosmetics palette and use the shade
there's no shade on here oh yes there's
numbers we're going to shade 4 which is
this trade right here on the top row I'm
just gonna use my finger these are super
soft which is nice put that on the lid
with my finger whoo I'm sure they're
pretty I'm gonna go back in with the Too
Faced palette and take the shade dreams
which is that matte a mauve color and
just blend this into the crease a little
bit more good some definition to the eye
you know I'm saying I'm going to take
that same shade Reindeer and blend it on
the lower lash line all right camera
just died but we're back has there ever
been a video with battery hasn't died i
just ran that shade on the bottom
lashline i'm going to wet this shade
locked a by luke sea beauty this is so
freakin pretty i think there i shadow
czar pretty affordable I'm gonna take
the brush it came with the Vice pala
dip this in and then I'm going to spray
it with a setting spray you'd also use
water or Mac 6 plus whatever you have
we're just going to put this right on
the center of the eye to give it some
shrine oh yeah how freakin pretty is
that for an inner corner highlight I'm
going to go back in with my sculpted
face tell it and take this light
highlight shade right here which is
beautiful this helps make you look so
much more awake and put whatever is left
over on my Cupid's bow because why not
I'm gonna go in with the H&amp;amp;M precision
eye marker it's just a liquid felt tip
eyeliner that I've actually really been
liking actually got complimented on my
eyeliner when I was wearing this so
that's a good sign it's super black
super matte stayed on all day I did a
whole first impressions video on the H&amp;amp;M
makeup line so I'll link that down below
or if you're on mobile you can click the
little eye over here and it'll open up
it goes over shimmery eyeshadows really
well too you know how some eyeliners
they just don't fully cover over like
glitter or shimmer so I just create the
base and then we're going to look up
ladies and gents
and there we have it I don't know if
we're going to be putting on falsies
today just because I want to trap the
falsies pushup drama mascara from
Maybelline I think I posted a picture on
Instagram of this in like the Ohi
opposite downtown Seattle got this crazy
new Walgreens it's one of the like
boutique Walgreens and you know it's
called they're insane they have like
high-end brands they have boots the balm
but then they also have their normal
drugstore stock and it's just super
pretty and it's like organized really
well so it makes it fun to shop this is
a cool tube
oh this totally looks like there would
be two different ends on it but it's not
so it doesn't have a curved brush I
usually go for curved brushes has a
little comb the comb wand
not bad it is a pretty dry formula it
feels like to me or maybe just because
I've been using two-faced for so long
the better than sex mascara this is
definitely one of those mascaras that if
you go over it too much you're going to
get the like sticking together kind of
lashes so I'm just going to let dry a
tiny bit and then go in for a second
coat
oh yeah we're getting a lot more action
on the second coat definitely liked it a
lot better with a second coat overall I
would totally use this again I'm happy
with it it feels a lot different than
what I'm used to but I do like it's very
separating and I've like in the look
that's giving my lashes right now so I'm
gonna go in with my favorite Wet n Wild
mega length mascara for the bottom
lashes I feel like we didn't talk about
life that much today I'm basically just
working trying to find time to film my
parents came last weekend which was fun
but I was sick the entire weekend I
rallied because we were eating very good
food and I wanted to see them obviously
um what else is new you know just live
in that bumble tinder life I think for
list we're gonna go with like a nude
combo thing I don't really know I'm
gonna go with this strip lipstick by
Urban Decay this packaging is so freakin
classy it has a magnetic closure or
something the way it closes is very
satisfying just such a nice formula I
really like the formula of this the way
that their lipstick is shaped do you
like really don't even need a lip liner
it's pretty easy to get in the lines of
your lips I think I'm going to apply a
tiny bit of a lighter shade to the
center this is Maybelline 920 nude lust
take down the clip right so this is what
the finished makeup looks like I like
how it turned out there weren't any
products that I used today that I
wouldn't recommend actually like the way
all these turned out if you guys liked
this video and you want to see more
shadow and schmooze videos give it a
thumbs up so I know that you like shadow
