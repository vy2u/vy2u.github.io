schmooze I don't like I'm wearing right
now I used some new makeup brands I've
never used before and I don't know which
just feelin the neon yellow today kind
of feel like what's-his-face from Sesame
Street but I'm also kind of loving it if
you're new to my channel shadow inch
moves are where we do a full face of
makeup and just chat and get ready and
it's a good time I'll leave a link to a
playlist down below if you want to watch
more shadow trans videos if you guys
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
getting over a cold right now so I sound
real great I'm gonna go ahead and prime
my face first this is the ultimate in
prime it's a really nice drugstore
smoothing primer I wouldn't say it's
super mattifying or anything but it does
help smooth out those pores my skin is
pretty bad right now I had a good week
or so and now it's back to this so I
have this Marilyn Monroe and I don't
even know how to say this but I have
this foundation from them this is the
celeb ray HD pro foundation in the shade
lt1 which I'm assuming is lighter shade
we're going to try this bad boy out says
to apply using a sponge or foundation
brush apply more liberally for greater
color density alright well we're going
to need some major color intensity to
cover this shit up so I have two
different sponges here I'm going to try
this is their brand this is the brown
brand and I had to literally like trap
open this container to get this thing
out couldn't get the top off this
actually feels really nice I have damp
in both of these this is my pure
cosmetic sponge
I think we're just going to sponge in
here this thing is actually pretty big
so let's just
ooh this feels interesting on the face
that's sponge
it actually might be this is pretty pale
I think this may actually be a little
bit too light that's okay we'll just
warm it up with some bronzer later on
but good to know if you're paler than me
this is pretty dang pale I think we're
going to do this sponge on one half of
the face and the other sponge on the
other definitely dewy finish I would say
this is like medium coverage covered all
my redness but some freckles and acne
scarring and acne is still showing
through okay I'm looking pretty wild I
think once we have bronzer and
everything on my face I'm not going to
look like as much of a ghost right now
so let's go ahead and use the other
sponge for the other half of my face and
just see if there's a difference
this sponge usually gives pretty good
coverage a little bit of this goes a
pretty long way so went into the
dermatologist last week to talk about
going on accutane and I got approved for
it or whatever decided that I'm not
going to start it until August I think
because it's such a big commitment like
you have to go in to get your blood
drawn once a month and then actually go
in for an appointment so it's literally
two doctor's appointments every month
and I'm going to be out of town I should
time coming up so I'm starting accutane
in August probably I think this side
actually gave a little bit better
coverage it does look a little lighter
on this side so anyways I think I'm
gonna go back to the dermatologist and
just have her put me on something else
in the meantime to try this acne
situation not cool I definitely don't
think my like stress levels right now
and diet are helping I have been eating
so crappy I wouldn't say this is like
buildable to a full coverage but I think
that it's got a solid medium coverage
going I could see this being good if you
have dry pale skin this has a super nice
luminous finish so for concealer today
I'm going to use that Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD I'm I like this I'm not like as
obsessed with it as some people are I
think it's a good concealer but I don't
know I'm just not wild about it not as
much coverage as everybody
naked gives me or my collection
concealer think I'm actually going to
run a little bit my collection whoa look
how dark that looks compared to my face
you guys see that this is how pale this
is right now we're gonna be using a
darker powder so this is fine it's
actually crazy because usually when I
put on my foundation this concealer
looks like pretty pale wears I'm going
to set the under-eye and i've been using
the stargazer powder that i've talked
about before this is a white pressed
powder I'm going to take the e48 brush
and set the under eyes okay let's get a
powder going so I can be brought back to
life think we're going to go with the a
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination in the shade fair this is a
tad dark so I think this will help make
me look more alive this is a Coastal
Scents BR one ten brush is one my
favorite powder brushes at the moment
and oh there we go there's some color
this powder has a really nice finish to
it if you're looking for a powder that
makes you look a tad bit dewy this is
beautiful you can see compared to this
side we're looking like a human being
again
and I like that this is still showing
through a little bit like you can still
see the finish to the foundation coming
through I'm actually liking how my skin
looks right now so from bronzer I want
to try out this super BB by Physicians
Formula this is the shade Universal
filter this is the in sturdy bronzer
favorite contour bronzer brush lately
has been the morphe for do a little
swirl No
it's actually nice like subtle bronze
color doesn't smell super strong like
their argan oil one whoa that one is so
fricken intense literally smells like
Grandma perfume blending out really
easily - I am using quite a bit put tiny
bit of this around my temples do we want
to do eyebrows or highlight first let's
do brows I have tattooed brows on right
now and I have a whole video talking
about that process and my experience and
everything so I'll link it down below
but what I've been doing in the morning
is like literally taking 30 seconds and
using this color pop pencil this is one
of our new pencils beggin brunette and
this is just a really nice pencil for
being like five dollars or whatever they
are I'm going to do a little bit more of
an intense shape today than I usually do
like on a daily basis just because we're
going to be having some bold eyes
alright we've got the brows on did a
little bit more intense than I usually
do I don't know was just feeling it so I
think I'm doing a right ass bold yellow
eye boo got his knees you don't have a
yellow base so I'm an attempt to use
this eyeliner by color pot this is just
their punch liner no idea how this is
going to go we're just having fun
I don't think I've ever done in yellow
high this weekend is like my major
filming weekend if you guys saw my
livestream on strobe last night I talked
all about this but basically like the
last few weeks have been freaking insane
working on something new job wise and
also just my whoa that looked a lot more
orange than it did in the pan I've gone
over the morphe 35o palette okay not
what I was envisioning but we're going
with it I think I went in with a mixture
of this and that we're gonna be adding
more Browns and things so it's fine
we'll make it work anyway so on top of
the new job and work and everything I
went home to San Diego two weekends ago
so I wasn't able to film then and then
last weekend my friend came to visit
from out of town which was really fun
but my weekends I usually want to get
all my YouTube stuff done so I've just
been behind on YouTube and it's been
like majorly stressing me out so this
weekend is my weekend to get back on
track before we go in with the yellow
shadow I'm actually going to do my like
outer crease blending I think I want to
warm up a brown because I don't want it
to look like you know so I'm going to
take this shade right here by the way
this is the Coastal Scents so8 brush and
this has been one of my favorites it's
like the perfect size to pack on color
but also blend at the same time um so
life I feel like we haven't done like a
sit-down actually talk about shit shadow
in shoes in a while work has been pretty
much taking over my life lately still on
tinder back on JDate I'm actually not on
tinder anymore I'm on bumble I deleted
tinder a while ago because it's hopeless
like on top of work my social life has
been busier too which is nice but I'm
just by the time the weekend comes I'm
just freaking exhausted I am like a
total introvert which I feel like a lot
of youtubers actually are seems like
what you're doing is really out there
and like social but really I'm like
sitting in a room talking to myself
right now on the weekend I need my me
time to just chill and like be by myself
okay it's all time my girl's mug has
been chillin in the back of our what's
that word shelf right now it's just I'm
so horrible girls used to be such a good
show just not funny anymore
I feel like I still need to watch it but
every time I'm watching it I'm like why
am I wasting a half-hour of my life
right now so going back in with that
yellow pencil so I have this which is
like a super neon yellow I also have
this vh1
but this one is shimmery and I'm not
sure if I'm feeling the shimmer I also
have this sit on a lace palette Pretty
Little Miss grace this yellow I could
use this one feels super nice I'm feelin
the Pretty Little Miss grace
going to go on with that we take my
Coastal Scents s20 brush and go in with
the shade twinkle star which is that
yellow shade oh yeah perfect actually
like that this has a tiny bit shimmer to
it and I'm blending it tiny bit into the
gray brown color we're going to be
putting a little bit more of that in
outer okay
taking the BR 250 from Coastal Scents
I'm going to go in with a mix of this
and this shade oops
I'm just kind of playing around and like
packing on different shades of brown
right now I don't want it to be too warm
okay let's blend that out a little bit
go back in with the yellow just to blend
into the brown alright when I put a
black liner on the waterline which I
think I need to sharpen this now I'm
going to go back in with that deepest
cool brown shade that we took this is
like the tiniest brush of life this is
the m5 one five kind of feel like I'm
going to like break this brush in half
right now I'm going to go in with that
transition shade that we first used and
blend that right below I'm use the
yellow pencil to put that right on the
inner corner I'm going to try out this
eyeliner I've never heard of this brand
before this is the grand liner lash
boosting will promote longer and thicker
thicker lashes in four to six weeks rich
black color waterproof formula and this
is like beautiful look at this packaging
looks like it's a felt-tip hope this is
good my attempt to make a little wing
with this
so when you have it on its side it's
pretty black and it goes on okay but one
of my issues with most liners is that
when you actually use the tip to create
the wing none of the product comes out
on the tip and that's kind of what
happen with this liner so I'm going to
create the base with this same liner
just so you have the same effect and I'm
going to go back in with my Physicians
Formula
eye booster to like fix that wing this
guy just never lets me down like not
even comparable to anything if you get
this make sure you get the ultra black
version we got our wings on let's go in
with some false lashes I think I'm just
going to go in with my good old violet
boss just slaying lashes are on so I use
the just layin lashes and I put some
bottom mascara on so now I'm going to go
in with my highlight I'm going to be
using this thing by city color this is
the highlight trio I think they have two
different shades of this this is the
collection one this middle shade is
gorgeous so we're just going to go in
with that look at that
my face is already pretty doing someone
keeps a nose highlight to a minimum for
blush I'm going to use this Bobbi Brown
shimmer brick this is from glambot I
think I got this for like 10 bucks or
something this isn't a shade rose for
lips I think I'm going to do like a
darky nude I'm going to try out these
two by color pop this is from their kpop
collection this is the shade cheat try
let's just line in my lips have been
like cracking like crazy lately blistex
has been the only thing that's been
working for my lips
haven't tried this open this not to
brownie
