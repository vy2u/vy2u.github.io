Friday night
all right so today we're doing an
old-school shadow in trades video if
you're new here this is where I put on
makeup and talk about life and answer
any of your questions I realized there
are a lot of new baby rose on board and
we haven't done the shadow into this
video in a while and if you haven't
watched any of my blogs or shadow
insurance videos I feel like this is the
best way to get to know each other the
comments section on shadow and choose
videos are my favorite because I feel
like I get to know you guys a little bit
better and if you are new here let me
know down below let me know where you're
from what's your name what do you do
let's jump into it I'm just going to
answer some of your questions we're
going to chill do some makeup so if you
like shadow and shows videos and you
want them to continue make sure you give
this video a thumbs up so I know if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
alright it looks like I'm wearing a bib
or something shadow and schmooze time
let's do this this is the second video
I'm filming today I'm gonna try this elf
blemish control face primer it's as it
has salicylic acid in it I love anything
with celso's acid in it feels like it
like a gel like aloe or something feels
really nice and cooling my skin feels
like it has a little bit of tackiness to
it which I like so for foundation I'm
just going to do a random combo I think
I'm going to mix the NARS sheer glow in
Siberia with the covergirl clean matte
be Beach this one is a little bit yellow
for me and this one is way too dark so
hopefully my cream you will work I
haven't used a NARS sheer glow in
forever I don't know why I don't think I
have a foundation review on this yet but
I'm just going to mix those 1 to 1 and
we're going to jump into the questions
in a second and just need to start
putting make bow of my face whenever I
edit these videos back I literally just
talk for 10 minutes in between doing
makeup and then I literally have like 4
hours of footage to go through so I'm
just going to use my pure cosmetic
sponge to stipple this on I like this
color combo actually that looks like
perfect I wish they made the covergirl
BB like 3 shades lighter this product is
completely underrated I have a whole
video on this it is amazing it's medium
coverage but buildable it lasts amazing
throughout the day doesn't get oily I
usually makes a difference foundations
when I need it to really stay all day
I'm actually really liking this combo
right now so it has been a hot minute
since I've done the shadow entrance
video there's always just so many new
products coming out and video ideas and
stuff
I want to do that Chadron schmooze kind
of take the backseat south the
expression has a nice satin matte finish
the shave is almost perfect so let's get
some questions going I have to go back
and find this tweet so Carolyn asked if
the makeup world was ending and you
could only save three products what
would they be so I'm going to go in with
the Tarte shave tape concealer kind of
on just use my sponge right now feeling
lazy
whenever I blend with a sponge I get way
less coverage underneath my eyes three
makeup products well my current favorite
foundation is the pur cosmetics bear at
all it just does everything I can use it
by itself it doesn't make me a li so
definitely save that one right now face
we're going to stop making makeup for
forever I'd probably pick an eyeshadow
palette probably like the Urban Decay
Naked ultimate basics palette I love
that thing actually we're gonna be using
that today maybe that except then I
won't have any shimmery eyeshadows and
then probably the Too Faced better than
sex mascara mozzie says how do you fix
liquid liner when you mess up without
messing up the rest of your makeup kind
of tricky to not mess up the rest of
your makeup when you have to redo it but
what I do I'm going on a stargazer
powder but what I do is just take some
liquid makeup remover on a q-tip and
just try and clean up the outer wing and
not totally redo everything just fix
where I messed up I usually have to
clean it up with like concealer under my
eyes so I want to try out the Maybelline
mapmaker powder again is this in the UK
makeup first impressions video and this
is just the second time I'm using it so
I'm going to try this out against
YouTube rush anyone else just think of
beauty this is a good question Naomi
says do you have any tips on time
management I'm a full time student and
doing stuff for my channel is always a
struggle so for those of you who are new
here or you haven't seen any of my other
shadow in his videos I started my
channel when I was in college so I was a
full time student and I've been doing it
ever since and I had a full 40 hours a
week full-time job up until about 6
months ago and now I do freelance
consulting so I've had to learn my fair
share of time management and just how to
do YouTube at the same time as having a
full time other commitment whoops I was
totally going to try out this elf under
eye setting powder next time okay so
this I'm really excited to try out this
is the Burberry light glow earthy brush
watch blush number 7 got this in London
and this was one of the things when we
were playing with all the makeup this
is what I was most excited to try out
because look at this shade it looks like
it's going to be a really nice kind of
cool tone to almost contour shade so I'm
going to try to use it as that will see
don't wanna do my eyebrows first mmm
so time management so I plan everything
out I could not survive without a
planner literally could not thinking
ahead at least a week and planning out
your days so you know exactly when you
have to do what is you have to do it I
usually figure out work wise what I have
to do at least a week in advance I
usually have about a week and a half
planned out just so I know what my three
days are when I'm going to have time to
do other things like go grocery shopping
go to the chiropractor and all my
doctor's appointments and all that so
what I basically do is plan out my
content first what I know I need to film
that week and then figure out when I'm
going to do what so for example when I'm
doing foundation Friday videos know that
I'm going to have my makeup on the full
day so I probably don't want to be
wearing a full-on smokey eye that day
and that's probably a day when I can go
run errands and do that kind of things
in between filming check-ins and
sometimes you have to either wake up
super early or stay up really late after
your other commitments to film okay and
you start doing this oh heck yes do you
guys do that color that is perfection I
don't like the smell this smells like
old lady makeup I think the biggest
thing to realize is that you have time
for anything that you want to commit to
is up to you to make time to do those
things that might be on the weekend that
might be after hours when you're super
tired and you just got home from work
but you need to film a video those are
just sacrifices that you have to make if
you want to get it done for years I
would film every Saturday on film two to
three videos spend my entire weekend
filming and then Sunday was editing so
that was just a choice that I made to be
pretty frank I don't really believe in
excuses I think if you want to do
something you'll make the time to do it
of course life happens and stuff comes
up but for the most part if you want to
be successful at something you're
excited about it and passionate about it
just love doing it you're going to make
time to do it kind of torn what I want
to do for blush because I have this
Rimmel blush here I want to try out this
is in the shade ten Santa Rose but I
also have these two pixie palettes I
haven't tried out yet these are kind of
more like highlighters and contours but
this shade right here I feel like might
be a nice blush kind of topper but
whether you're making videos
or you have a side business and you're
in school or you just have a hobby that
you want to dedicate more time to I feel
like scheduling out and literally making
yourself think about when you're going
to do what and actually plan it out is
so helpful for saving time before I go
to bed at night I know exactly what I
have to get done the next day and just
kind of keep yourself in check the other
thing is that I'm going with this Rimmel
blush like and if it's open when you're
doing YouTube or running your own
business or whatever it is there's no
one telling you when to do what and
forcing you to do it you're your own
boss so it really is up to you to get
 done this is pretty this actually
looks a lot more pink than it does in
the pan this I am super excited to try
out this is by Becca this is our new
highlighter look at this packaging on
the inside of this is super exciting so
this is like very purpley I'm going to
add a tiny bit of a white highlight on
top to tone it down a bit but this is
pretty if you're going for that for the
bridge of my nose and just add a bit
more white I'm going to go in with the
London luster glow powder this is the
Aspen no vard pixie highlight and I'm
just going to add that right to the top
we're going to be really glowing today
and then Cupid's bow and down the bridge
of my nose fun to browse and we need
another questions Jocelyn Jones says are
you a cat or dog person a hundred and
fifty percent dog person Sadie says are
there any languages you want to learn do
you speak any other languages than
English I speak relatively speaking I
speak Arabic and a little bit of Hebrew
I thirties Arabic in college for four
years and then Hebrew I kind of wrapped
in Hebrew school but misspelled that and
I also took a Hebrew class and I was
living in tel-aviv after Jordans and are
there any languages I want to learn yeah
I love languages I definitely want my
kids to grow up speaking a second
language
I have permanent brows so I kind of just
go in and outline them with this because
sometimes my foundation just covers them
up a bit and then I'm going on with my
older brow gel so I kind of want to try
this Becca under eye brightening
concealer as an eye primer it looks like
it might be a nice kind of salmon color
for that oh yeah this actually is pretty
tacky feeling bredda says how do you
deal with people that negatively comment
on your
again does it bother you love your
personality and your face thank you the
skin comments oddly enough don't bother
me at all
I think the ones that do bother me is
when people assume that they know
everything about your health whether
it's what you're putting into your body
or what you've done for your skin or
they assume that you've never gone to a
dermatologist or a doctor so really
quick and then we're going to get back
to that topic I'm going to go in with
the Urban Decay Naked ultimate basics
palette when I was in London I was
snapping in a bunch of you asked to see
a video on the look that I was wearing
them so I figured we would just do that
in this video
I'm start out mixing in shades commando
and tempted and just putting that into
the crease and what I did was mostly
like a cool toned look I just added a
tiny bit so I have some left over on the
brush whoops I think just as someone who
has lots of health issues those comments
where people just assume they know
everything about your bodies just drives
me crazy so skin comments and mostly
just like comments on physical
appearance those ones never really get
to me I don't really care what you say
about my face my body and at the end of
the day if I'm happy with it that's all
I really care about Tara a has a couple
good questions she says what are your
pet peeves with people what do you look
for in a guy future boyfriend so my pet
peeves with people and by the way we're
going to go in with I'm pretty sure I
use face maybe a little bit of instinct
- there's like purple one and I'm just
going to start to like smoke out this I
bit my pet peeves late people definitely
late people it drives me crazy like all
you got to do is set your alarm 20
minutes earlier so I got to do I don't
get it and I think my other pet peeve is
people who constantly make excuses for
why something's not happening like I
just don't want to hear it just get it
done I'm going to take instinct that
purple color and do kind of a halo I
definitely have other colors on this
brush right now which is not helping
these matte shades in here just blend
out so easily urban decay killed it with
this palette this is probably my
favorite palettes they've come out with
what do you look for in a guy people
that are adventurous funny intelligent
and determined those are probably my top
ones honest loyal all that kind of stuff
but I think those are my top my top
qualities so I'm going to take lethal
which is this dark purple shade and just
smelt this out a bit I'm only adding
this to the outer corner I'm not going
to bring this in so Katie says favorite
photo slash video editing
we're by the way Thank You Katie for
always tweeting me and snapping me she
rocks so I don't like any video editing
software I really despise the whole
editing process I use Final Cut Pro now
I just made the switch few months ago
like I've had more glitches on Final Cut
than I did on iMovie but I don't know
could just be me photo editing software
this is actually a question I get asked
a lot on Instagram what apps I use we
might as well answer that in this video
so my go-to apps for editing Instagram
photos vsco cam and pics LR are like my
go-to if Co cam just has the best
filters and then I'll go in with color
pop I think it's called and gray out
some of the backgrounds I have like a
gray Instagram theme going got to keep
the theme up you know in the past couple
months I've kind of started posting more
lifestyle II stuff on Instagram rather
than just makeup photos I just love
taking and editing those kind of photos
so much more oh God
Leslie come in and strong with this
question she says if you had to give up
either face mask coffee or Foundation
which would you choose
definitely not coffee I think I would
give up face mask yeah Foundation just
brings me too much joy in life face mask
I would just DIY my own face mask and
make it work right I don't even know
what I've been doing on my eyes I'm
going to go in and blend with the e27
brush Maddy says what piercings do you
have I have obviously a lip piercing I
get asked all the time if this was fake
now this is this is real this is in my
lip I used to have my nose pierced
before I got my lip piercing and then I
took that out when I got my lips I used
to have way more piercings on my ears
like I had them all the way up the side
I also have my bellybutton pierced
I've got my bellybutton pierced in
college and I just kind of kept it okay
so the lid shade that I used that day
was Vermeer by Anastasio Beverly Hills
this is the prettiest lid shade ever you
could use this on your inner corner too
if you wanted to but it's just super
look at that I mean that's without a
setting spray or anything it's just
gorgeous and I'm just putting this right
on the center and then I'm going to use
a brush afterwards to blend into both
colors but with the halo I am NOT going
to bring this all the way inwards I'm
just literally putting this on the
center going back in with the morphe r39
I'm just going to blend the purples into
here then I'm going to take my finger
with Vermeer again and put it
back in the center it just gives it that
extra pop so I've been really liking the
Catrice liquid metal gel eyeliner this
is what I wore and it lasted all day on
my liquid on my liquid liner on my
waterline and it doesn't burn my eyes
which is tricky for me to find I'm going
to bring this a little bit below my lash
line because we're going to be smudging
it out we're going to go in with
blackjack I did a pretty smoky bottom
lash line that day Amy says what's your
favorite book slash movie of all time
and why did it speak to you so much so
if you follow me on snapchat you know I
am obsessed with Colleen Hoover she's
pretty much all I've been reading lately
negev read like six or seven of her
books now I just finished hopeless it
was amazing I still think I like too
late and November 9th better so you want
to get into reading and you like kind of
romance but a little bit dark Colleen
Hoover never disappoints every single
book is great I'm gonna go back in with
instinct that purple color just blend
that down underneath the black for the
inner corner I think I'm going to try
and just use that same highlight that I
used we are going in for liquid liner
I'm going to use my Physicians Formula
eye booster ultra black there are some
random questions in here Kayla says do
you like boba do you like boba I find it
really appealing I can feel like I could
sit there and just chew boba all day
moment of silence while I do the
eyeliner okay we got our wings on so the
first time I wore this I do not wear
false lashes because I tend about an
hour of wearing false lashes my eyes get
totally red and itchy and I have to like
take off all my makeup I've tried 30
different kinds of lash glue if you also
have this issue and you found a lash
glue that works let me know what it is
down below because I feel like I've
tried them all
but for today so you can see what the
whole look would look like with falsies
I'm going to put on some false lashes
these are the peer lashes in the kind
the kind in this style jetsedder
I haven't tried these ones yet they look
nice and separated so I'm going to coat
my lashes with some Too Faced present
sex and then go in with those falsies
and I will be right back alright falsies
are on and I can confidently say that
these are my new favorite lashes what
the heck perfectly separated not too
long not too short the band feel
comfortable on my lash lines so on that
day I was wearing the Too Faced melted
matte liquid lipstick and cool girl
because these stay on me so well I feel
like these are really underrated I don't
hear a whole lot of people talk about
this liquid lipstick but these are bomb
they're not the absolute most
moisturizing liquid lipstick formula
I've tried but I'm kind of compared to
like Stila stay all day maybe a tiny bit
thinner but on me this looks like kind
of a muted brown color but I want to try
out these new pure velvet matte liquid
lipsticks of the shade obey here I also
have SBS it's not the shades fef is more
Brad toned this one's kind of like a
mauve can I want to go with the mauve
one does it smell like whoa okay this is
way too pink
let's try FBF and wipe this off well
that's just like stain my lip it has
like a triangle applicator okay this one
is more of like a brick red not really
feeling this color either alright let's
give this one a go this is the morphe
liquid lip in the shade Sasha I'm not
super impressed by these but for the
price I mean formulas remind me almost
exactly of colour-pop they're very thin
whoo I like to color it smell good they
smell like cake it's actually making me
really hungry right now oh how good does
funfetti sound fun fact they make
gluten-free funfetti cookies and I
ordered them on Amazon okay so I do
really like this color the formula this
one is a lot less patchy than some of
the darker shades I've tried it seems
like the colors aren't very consistent
in this line some of them have been
great and some of them have been kind of
a total disaster a super patchy but this
one is really nice I think that's
everything feel like I'm forgetting
something so hope you guys like this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know make sure you're
following me on all my social channels
because that is where I do Q a kind of
things love you guys thanks for watching
