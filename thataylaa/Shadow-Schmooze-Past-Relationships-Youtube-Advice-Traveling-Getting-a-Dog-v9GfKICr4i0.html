brutal reality let me give you a tip
all right so today we are filming a very
impromptu shadowing schmooze it is
actually 11:30 p.m. right now
I don't know got a second wind felt like
talking you guys I asked you on Twitter
to ask any questions you want me to
answer in this video so this is just a
chill putting makeup on my face and
talking to you guys in the middle of the
night that's what YouTube is for right
so hope you guys enjoy this video if you
do while you're watching don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the bay Rito family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time
let's do this
10/10 what am i doing I've already
washed moisturize and primed my face
with jojoba oil never thought I would
say that sentence in my life but my skin
is starting to get a bit dry from the
accutane so I'm gonna go in with two
kind of more moisturizing foundations
and try mixing the josie maran vibrancy
foundation and rg5 with the covergirl
vitalists health elixir in 705 this one
I love but it's so friggin dark so I'm
gonna mix the two shades okay I've only
actually used this once it looks hella
dirty but I want to try its pressure
again despite a cosmetics skin smoothing
complexion let's try it out about 5
minutes ago I was wearing a leopard robe
North Face egg boots and my hair is like
half full and out right now the
extensions looking great so we're doing
the beanie my roots are also like an
inch grown in right now you know when
you book your hair appointment like way
far out so you just have ratchet here
for two weeks I've gotten a lot of
questions to do a quick accutane update
and I'm still trying to decide if I'm
gonna do a one month update cuz it's
coming up like next week or if I should
just do a two month update but like I
don't have enough to talk about to make
a whole video on it so maybe I could
just give you guys a quick almost one
month accutane update check my most
recent vlog if you want to see kind of
the first week ish but since then so far
so good I am only on thirty milligrams
right now so next month
it goes up to sixty and I think that's
when a lot of the dryness and everything
is gonna kick in I only started noticing
my skin starting to get dry a few days
ago right now I'm on day 18 I have been
taking notes and stuff for when I do do
update videos I like this shade I was a
good shade mix a bunch of you guys have
said you see
skin are you starting to clear up and
it's hard for me to tell I don't know
you know when you can't really tell on
your own self but you can tell on
someone else from day one though pretty
much I was majorly moisturizing and
making sure my skin is super hydrated
and my lips and everything my lips have
been getting more dry than usual and not
horrible yet but so far I think taking
care of it since the beginning has
helped I'm gonna go in with chart shape
tape this has actually been looking
pretty dry under my skin lately so I
need to try and find a more moisturizing
one that I like I think is kind of fun I
mean it's not it's not gonna be fun when
my skin is like peeling off my face in a
couple months but right now it's kind of
fun like switching up my products and
finding new stuff that I liked it
doesn't make me super oily it's great so
far not gonna would I need some serious
wet in here ok I feel like I have some
life updates for you guys the next few
months I'm very excited for there's some
really fun things happening I already
told you guys about one of them I'm
going to be doing a meet-up on Sunday
November 19th I'll have the link down
below for tickets 100% of the proceeds
go to project beauty sure it's in
Spokane so that'll be down below besides
that one of the things I'll be
announcing really soon like I think when
this video goes up probably within a
week or two yeah you guys won't know
about it it's not the most obnoxious
youtuber thing ever let me tell you
about something that I can't actually
tell you about yet hold on do I need
more concealer I feel like I'm not
really thinking about my makeup right
now I kind of just wanted to sit down
and talk with you guys I don't know if
I'm gonna do like a full-on makeup look
I just want to just want to chat you
know tart shave tape doesn't work very
well to spot conceal it like doesn't
actually cover that well I like the
Maybelline instant age rewind a lot
better I'm gonna go on Twitter because
some of these ended up tying in to the
updates I wanted to tell you guys
anyways I'm trying to answer as many as
I can so Kim Coleman says any new travel
plans what's happening with work etc so
basically the next November December
January three months are gonna be kind
of insane I think I'm gonna be in
Seattle a total of not even three weeks
or about three weeks between those three
months so the rest of the time I'm going
to be completely gone which means right
now like these two weeks in November are
kind of crazy slush stressful because
I'm trying to get three months somebody
was done I'm gonna try my best to get
the normal three videos a week up I'm
also gonna be bringing my camera on some
of the places I'm going so hopefully I
can film some videos when I'm gone too
I'm gonna need to I think I was looking
at my calendar trying to plan everything
out tonight and that's part of the
reason why we're sitting here right now
filming because I got slightly
overwhelmed with everything I still have
to film this nose-ring just keeps
popping out I think the bar is too long
but the guy said I can't change it for
like six months
use this booboo bronzer buy time this
video goes up you guys will have already
seen the first impressions but I want to
try this again
this one had potential you know I'm
gonna take that cool tone shade again oh
I like that tone this is like three
bucks or something so basically I go to
Spokane for the Meetup two days later I
go to Oregon with my dad for like five
days which will be really fun and then
December is the holidays my side of the
family in San Diego celebrates Hanukkah
so I'm going there for Hanukkah like the
first part of December and back for a
few days and then I go to North Carolina
to celebrate Christmas with my other
side of the family let's do brows oh man
I'm so not in the mood for brows right
now we're gonna make it happen and I go
to North Carolina I'm forgetting some
trip in between here I've been really
liking the messier like combed up look I
just need to get my brow hairs grown out
a little bit I think and then I'm back
in Seattle for I think three days to do
my accutane lab test cuz you have to do
monthly lab work and it's kind of strict
the dates you have to do it you have to
do within like four weeks or something
the exact week so I have to be in the
states beginning of January to get the
lab work done and then I'm going to
Europe for a month surprise I actually
just figured this out two days ago
getting the tickets and everything in a
couple days but it actually worked out
perfectly because I don't want to say
anything about part of the trip yet
because it's not 100% confirmed but when
it is I'll let you guys know but
basically part of the trip is like a
YouTube work kind of trip which is
really exciting and then the other three
weeks I'll be traveling Europe with my
old roommate because she's gonna be over
there for something anyways never I
travel I want to travel with people
people usually just can't get it off
work or the schedule doesn't line up or
whatever so whenever someone want a
buddy to travel with I'm down
I love solo travel I'm totally down for
solo travel as well but it's always nice
when you have a friend to go to
especially somewhere like Europe where
it will probably be like going out at
night and stuff so we have like a rough
outline of where we're going but I think
right now we're gonna be going to
Budapest Prague where else Amsterdam one
other place I can't remember Wow I
didn't even think about my brows and
they turned out better than they usually
do when I think about them maybe I
should try that more often so that's
gonna be super fun I'm so excited
traveling is like what I live for
honestly I don't know I just feel like
most my self when I am traveling I've
I'm in the bush I've been really feeling
this BH floral blush this is in the
shade Caribbean coral so I need to
figure out what the plan is for videos
and how I'm doing that if I'm going to
be gone for literally a month in January
15 days of foundation is shortly after I
get back so it's just gonna be complete
chaos majorly working on everything for
the next series with Project B to share
a lot of moving parts have to come
together I haven't decided if I want to
vlog the whole trip it might be nice to
look back on and just for you guys to
see let me know if you guys want to see
that I did vlog parts of my Taiwan and
China trip the last two trips I took a
few months ago I'll link those down
below in the description box if you
missed him I don't know I might do a few
travel related videos both filmed while
I'm there and ahead of time we're gonna
be staying in hostels and stuff I'm
pretty sure so probably won't be like
filming in a hospital room but you never
know I like that this is the new
physician's formula butter highlighter
which I used in last week's foundation
Friday video but my foundation looked so
shitty that it was hard to see what this
product looked like on top that looks
nice it's like a nice sheen but still
intense ooh I have tea right now can we
talk about this tea quote I got today
life is a flow of love your
participation is requested I don't know
about you universe but I'm all here for
love I'm ready to be taken off tinder
any moment now I would like to request
your participation back world
seriously though someone asked what the
pros and cons of living in Seattle is
let me see if I can find the person
Mathis and the only con I could think of
honestly was the dating scene pretty
horrible everything else about Seattle
is freaky
amazing okay let's get some questions
going so he says can you update us on
your helix mattress how do you like it
PS I love you I love you too got a bunch
of questions about this so let me just
give a ten-second answer still love it
very comfortable I have no qualms with
it that's a great great word nothing bad
to say about it I still really enjoy it
iris says how to maintain friendships
when you're swamped that's a good
question and that is something that is
really hard because it's almost like a
trade-off if you're really trying to
pursue something maybe you're working
two jobs or you're doing one full-time
job and pursuing like your passion
project on the side or whatever it is
all of those extra hours if you want to
make it happen really for me they went
to YouTube
knocking alive for me it was really hard
it was really hard to prioritize
friendships for me because I'm sometimes
too career-focused I feel like I don't
regret it because without putting in
those hours I wouldn't be able to enjoy
time with my friends and do what I love
right now this kind of goes in with the
planning stuff but I literally instilled
to this day carve out time for friends
so I have like certain days when I know
Rachel has a couple hours free fand I
can plan in to not be working then so I
guess just planning ahead there's so
much less you everywhere everyone
has the exact same amount of hours in a
day it's not crazy so it's literally
just how you prioritize it Oh Rach Rach
B is the one that said what's it like
living in Seattle pres and cons I'm
actually gonna be doing a what to see in
Seattle video I started filming it last
weekend and this is gonna be a freaking
beast let me just say that we only shot
two locations like one to two places out
of about six or seven that I'm gonna be
mentioning in the video and it took us
five hours it's just crazy cuz it'll
probably be like a ten minute video I
thought about just doing like a sit down
one telling you guys everything but
that's not very exciting and I want
people to be able to see how beautiful
and amazing Seattle is because you guys
don't get it
Seattle is the best Wanda says I've been
curious what happened to your lip ring I
actually talked about it in a 15 days of
foundation video because during the
series is when I took it out what am i
doing
get some makeup going over here I'm
gonna use that you had me at hello color
pop palette the packaging of this is so
nice and it has a nice weight to it I
use this one time before but I just went
in with some of the matte shades I think
what was I talking about
Oh lip ring yeah I talked about it in
that video but I don't know just ready
for a change you know one sometimes you
don't connect to your own body does that
make any sense oh no I just wasn't
feeling the lip ring I just wanted to
change and I can always go back that's
the great thing with piercings everyone
has an opinion on it though which is
funny because I don't remember asking I
knew that was gonna happen it's all good
but I want to switch to all gold jewelry
I've been like slowly getting new gold
rings and stuff and when I can in a few
months I want to switch it out to really
thin against the nose kind of gold hoop
I love the look of those she doesn't
have anyone here says are you more of a
cat or a dog person
definitely dog person I don't understand
the cat thing don't murder me I don't
get it I don't know I'm not a cat person
at all like I can appreciate a cat but I
just don't want one in my life them more
exciting life news I've actually been to
buy time you guys are seeing this all
been to my second training two foster
dogs there's two trainings you have to
do before you can start fostering and I
won't be able to actually get my first
dog until February since it would be
gone all January but I'm so excited and
fostering rather than adopting because I
just don't feel like I'm at a place in
my life where I know I'm gonna be here
like even in the u.s. I mean know how
I'm gonna be in the US for I feel like
I'm gonna move sometimes in the next
couple years but there are so many
animals that need fostering and adoption
Adriana says what's your favorite
holiday coffee definitely peppermint
mocha I'm a fan of the peppermint mocha
not so much pumpkin spice latte though
without that in my life but I love
peppermint mocha season yes when's the
last time you finish a bottle of
foundation because you're always trying
so many actually pretty recently I am
almost out of the cosmetics CC
illumination but it's been a while come
in and I'm also almost out of the milk
makeup blur liquid it's like down to
here I could probably squeeze a lot more
out Julia says if you had to choose one
high-end makeup brand to collaborate
with which brand would it be one
high-end
brand I don't know I feel like I use
more drugstore makeup what's the
high-end brand that I use a lot I don't
know I feel like if it was drugstore
brand I could easily say a physician's
formula just because I feel like I love
so many of their products or BH
Cosmetics I've had a lot of BH Cosmetics
stuff that I really like lately I don't
know comment down below what you think
the brand would be Daniella says current
favourite TV shows I'm currently hooked
on blacklist I gave it at the
beginning I will admit I retracted
statement because season I think it's
the last one on Netflix that season in
the season 4 I've seen 3 it gets good
I love Quantico - I still think I like
Quantico a little bit better and like I
said I'm not doing an actual makeup look
in here we are Kyra says do you plan on
calling Seattle home forever or do you
consider moving around again I
absolutely love Seattle I think I could
see myself coming back here at some
point I'm in my 20s like this is the
time to move around and travel and go
live other places hard because I love
Seattle like I love my life here and I
love my daily whatever my apartment
everything and it has been the first
place that I've really felt like is home
to me like when I come back from a trip
it just feels like home so I definitely
think I'll be back here but I do want to
live somewhere else in the next couple
years a rep says long-distance
relationships any advice helps or just
tacos those help do tacos Mexican food
helps everything I don't know if I ever
had talked about this I'm I probably
have years ago but I've been in two
actually serious long-distance
relationships one was for three years
we're still friends to this day I just
saw him a few months ago and the other
one was more recent after I was living
abroad actually met him in Israel but he
was Canadian I was living in Tel Aviv I
had an internship there and everything
he was back in Canada that was like
major long-distance what does that time
difference I think 9 hours 8 hours the
Cameron Bure so not only are you not
with each other but you're in totally
different time zones and I was like that
was the hardest here's my opinion on
long-distance relationships having been
in a couple I don't know how
end up in long-distance relationships I
personally feel like people who haven't
been in long-distance relationships
don't really understand I think
especially when you're younger you get
kind of a lot of for it but don't
get it they don't think they're as
serious when in reality a lot of times
you actually get way closer because all
you really have is communication and
Trust because you're not there and all
you can do is communicate the other
thing is that I feel like both people
have to be a hundred percent on the same
page because if you're not it's just
it's not gonna work long distance is a
lot of freaking work so if you're not
willing to put in that work and effort
both people then it's gonna be really
hard to maintain
I know long distance isn't for everyone
but personally if someone's not willing
to kind of do that short term to be with
each other at long term then I don't
know I just I probably wouldn't want to
be with someone like that long term
anyways you know I'm saying but as far
as if you are in a healthy long-distance
relationship just maintaining it I would
say we always used to know exactly when
we're gonna see each other next just so
you could have something to look forward
to and kind of count down I will say and
you know what I mean if you're in one or
happen in one when you do finally see
each other it is the best thing ever it
is so special and just I feel like you
value your time together more oh this
Brown is pretty dude that is so
pigmented and matte Ali says are you
going to release any Spotify playlist I
swear we have the same taste in music
PSP Ella Seattle burrito here um
actually I was thinking about that the
other day I might do like a blog post
with some of my current favorite songs
or something I don't think I want to
make my Spotify public just because I
like having some things private in my
life you know just give me Spotify
sometimes it feels like everything is
out there I know why my eyes are so red
right now probably cuz it's 11 p.m. now
Ashley says hair update I haven't talked
about this in a while actually so might
for those who you don't know tried to go
to grey does the total fail hair fell
off got totally fried ended up basically
accidentally going back to black but now
I'm really happy that I did so I've been
wearing tape and extensions for the past
has it been like six months now neva no
I think
as maybe more than that actually all of
the totally dead hair has been chopped
off thank god it's finally grown out
enough that we've been able to chop it
off and my real hair now you can see
right here it's actually it's getting
pretty long it's down to here now before
you guys it was like up to here I think
I'm gonna keep the extensions in until
it grows out maybe an inch or two more I
hundred percent prefer tapings over
clip-ins over fusions tapings are the
best in my opinion and I yell e and I
gaily that's a really pretty name
probably butchering it she said how did
you manage to find a job so soon after
college actually have a whole video on
that I'll link it down below it's really
old but it's titled how to get a job
after college goes in-depth about that
process Amy says favorite song at the
moment oh I have like four pills and
automobiles post Malone I'm really into
post Mon right now congratulations is
amazing random but Atlantic City by the
band this is actually playing in the
vlog one of the moving vlogs when I was
in that huge antique store and I ended
up finally finding it I think because
one of you guys commented randomly and I
had been like hardcore searching trying
to figure out what song that was now
it's my favorite like nighttime wind
down song it's so nice I don't think I
want to do a winged liner should I put
on lashes I mean just gonna tear them
off to go to bed Samantha says would you
consider moving to Houston absolutely
not
no offense doll the Houstonians lash
update my eyelashes have almost grown
back after the lash extensions I am
gonna be getting them again for the
January trip hoping hoping that my skin
at that point will be okay enough to not
wear a foundation the whole time that
would be friggin amazing that's only in
like two months though right
yeah so who knows watch my local boot in
the purge phase Miranda says what are
some good tips on growing a youtube
channel slash Instagram I would say
number one especially for people going
into it right now is be passionate about
it have the right intentions and be
ready to work your butt off because a
lot of people just want it to happen
overnight and they don't realize that it
takes literally years I mean I was
making videos for solid five months
where I think I was
like under 50 views on each video that's
just how it works you do it because you
love it that wasn't really a tip that
was just brutal reality let me give you
a tip if I was doing YouTube tomorrow I
would say test a bunch of different
kinds of content see what resonates with
people see what you're most excited
about making and then hopefully you can
find a combo of both because you
obviously want to be excited about what
you're creating but you also have to be
creating content that people are going
to click on and want to watch and want
to subscribe another tip especially in
2017 the year of the friggin iPhone X
you do not need to invest in the super
expensive camera even like an actual
camera
there's 4k video on iPhones now the
normal video is good enough as well you
really just need natural light sit in
front of a window film on your iPhone
maybe get a little iPhone mic that you
can plug in so the sound quality is
better as long as you have good lighting
you'll be fine filming on your iPhone so
test it out and make sure you actually
enjoy filming videos so many people
focus on the editing software and the
equipment and all this stuff and it's
like just freaking start just start see
if you like it as long as you're not
like sitting in a freaking shadow in
your faces blurry
then it'll be good enough to start on
like I said there's not gonna be a lot
of people likely landing on your channel
when you first start anyways so just get
used to it and see if it's something
that you want to continue doing and want
to invest in most youtubers who have
been doing this for years now started on
this super shitty camera did not have
setup and everything that they do now
and I know it's hard to watch his videos
and feel like that's what you have to do
but when you're starting out you don't
do just do it have fun
stop making excuses for why you can't do
it if you have an iPhone you have no
excuse and some kind of computer that
you can edit on Windows Movie Maker in
the Apple iMovie are included in free
software on the computer so if you have
those two things you're good to go just
get started and do it this is the rimmel
32 innocent liner and I'm gonna put the
B hue natural nude on top still one of
my favorite liquid lipstick formulas
alright so I think that's everything I
answered but if you guys enjoy shadow
and schmooze don't forget to give this a
sup so I know it helps me out any time
you guys leave a comment like whatever
it basically tells YouTube people are
liking it and they can recommend it to
other people to watch so it really does
help us out any youtuber that you engage
with so thank you to those of you who
take the time to leave comments I really
appreciate it it's my shadow music
playlist will be linked down below in
the description box if you guys want to
go back and watch any others the
exciting announcement video will be
coming in the next couple weeks so stay
tuned I love you guys thanks for
watching see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
