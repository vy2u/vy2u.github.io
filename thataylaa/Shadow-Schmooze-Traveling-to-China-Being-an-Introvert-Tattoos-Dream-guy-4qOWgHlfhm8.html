now sounds so
all right so today we have a shadow and
schmooze video on the look I'm wearing
right now just on my favorite videos to
film and I asked you guys in les know
two weeks ago to foundation Friday
videos the wet and wild one to leave any
questions that you want answered in the
comment section so I'm literally just
pulling all my questions from that video
it's a weird day I've had every
technical tech I've had every
technological issue possible happen
today if this is your first shout
entrance this is where we put on makeup
and talk about life and I answer any of
your questions I love getting to know
you guys as well in these videos so if
you're new or if you just want to say hi
leave a comment down below with where
you are from and what do you do what are
you do in life let me know if you want
to see how I got this look you're in the
right place just you watch him alright
it has my chin reflector today I was
picturing like a tiny ass triangle this
thing this thing is giant hopefully my
chin is mellowed up it actually makes a
difference if I hold it right here
this is without if you look at my chance
darker and then with this is reflecting
the light so it's like an equal amount
of light so I can't fit it here on my
lap because it's freakin huge so I have
on the source kind of makes a difference
maybe I don't know I have had
technological issues from hell today
hoping my mics plugged in we're back in
my room obviously I've already washed
moisturize and I prime my face with the
hard candy sheer envy poor defense
primer serum silicone free oil free
alcohol free my skin is majorly breaking
out on my chin right now and pressures
from the face are chilly a foundation
that I did on foundation Friday are you
doing here a hair is a shitshow right
now this day is just a show I
usually film first thing in the morning
like right when I wake up and it is the
reap iam in the afternoon right now I'm
going to jump into the questions in a
second but let's start out with
foundation so I can start putting that
stuff on my face someone you just
released a brand new shade in their
conceal imperfection H is zero zero
light natural this is the new lightest
shade it is still not pale princess
friendly it's still pretty dark and
super yellow I still have to mix in the
lightener with this for sure I do a
whole old review on this product but
because it's too dark and it's pretty
matte and it's pretty yellow I'm going
to mix it in the Josie Maran vibrancy
our nation fluid I have a whole video on
this lovin foundation it is super dewy
it is also
a pink toned so I think this might be a
good combo what we actually just found a
clean brush hallelujah all the products
will be linked down below I'm not going
to mentioning exactly what I'm using is
time probably let's start answering
questions so Ashley s says when are you
going to fill in pale shades contour
video so that is still coming that's
where that line foundation is still be
able to still come through imma know if
it's yellow it's almost like a weird
orange tint to it
bizarre Emma Castillo Costello says you
mentioned you booked a random one-way
ticket to China why are you planning on
going there one enter the new lady on
snap that I booked a ticket to China
it was super random and super like
spur-of-the-moment which tends to be how
I both most trips I would just totally
play rather spend my money on plane
tickets and traveling then cars and
clothes and bags and things like that
there's a couple trips last year went to
Iceland and normally and actually
blogged it so if you miss that I'll put
the blog over here but I just realized
like what am i doing I want to travel
more this year I have the flexibility
which really no excuse not to and there
are really affordable ways to travel you
don't have to spend a ton of money
traveling you can volunteer you can use
world world keeper what's it called you
can like exchange skills for staying and
work in hostels you can stay places for
free through different websites I'll put
a couple of them down below if you're
curious but anyways off topic so I'm
going back to Jordan this summer and I
was trying to get my friend to come who
was also enjoying when I was there and
he is currently getting as masters in
China which is very cool very proud of
you Arbor he watched my videos China's
on the places I probably just wouldn't
go to if I didn't know someone there or
if I have like an excuse to go there to
be totally honest it's not at the top of
my places that I want to see but when
you know someone in the country is
pretty much fluent in Chinese it's just
so nice to be able to see a country that
way versus just being a complete tourist
and going so I haven't booked the plane
ticket back yet because I don't really
know what I'm doing I think we may be
going to Taiwan afterwards and then I'm
looking into doing Spain afterwards just
because I'm like 150 or 200 dollar
ticket from China to Spain and it's on
the way
obviously but I'm super excited that's
in May totally pull this down my neck
because this color still it's off I'm
not liking this Milani heart-shaped tape
in G 38 by Murphy China will be in May
pretty sure Jordans going to be in July
and I'm trying to figure out my
apartment situation I really wish I
could air B&amp;amp;B out my room or something
that's a whole other topic I think there
was actually a question about that okay
let's move on splitter M says for your
shadows freeze video what are your goals
in 2017 either personally or career one
of my super I guess attainable goals is
to write in my as a five-day journal
session my bed not Sunday one line a day
five year memory book and I actually did
it for an entire year one time printed
them out before so these pages are like
huge right now but this is super cool
it's basically for five years you can
fill in the year you write an entry just
one line every single day and I have a
pretty horrible memory when it comes to
certain things and whenever I look back
on my year I remember like the main
things that happen but there's just so
many things that I feel like I forget so
I just want to start jotting down every
single day one line something that
happened or something that I did or
something that stood out I feel like
it's just a good way to remember the
small things not every day is like a big
you know event for most of us so that's
the small goal and you can get that off
of Amazon for like 10 bucks a link down
below yeah traveling a lot this year is
goal continuing to focus on my health I
feel like I've made major improvements
the last year so continuing to try to
put my health first and I don't mean by
like eating healthy and stuff or like
going to the gentleman and I guess as
part of it that's your probably be on
the list
I'm gonna take my stargazer powder that
I used to set my under eyes and then
career I definitely have separate goals
I don't really want to talk about Sarah
Petrillo says non Beauty question do you
have any tips on moving to a new city
yes I do
let's go in with the laura geller
balanced and brightens no double shake
baked powder to set I would say the
hardest time I ever had living and
moving to a new city was after Jordan
when I lived in Israel first summer I
was totally by myself I didn't know
anyone there at the time which is weird
because I usually know like someone
who's living in the Israel at a certain
point just because if you're if you're
Jewish
it just happens but I knew no one I was
completely on my own and so what I would
do was go to like the hostel kitchen
doesn't apply as much in the US but if
you're International when you're trying
to meet people go to hostel kitchens
even if you're not staying there they
have like events and stuff and kitchens
are just a place where people always
like hungry and it's really easy to meet
people there but as far as like in the
US or wherever you are I would say it
force yourself to go out and do things
especially when you first move there and
you start talking to people and you can
say like oh yeah I just moved here a
couple weeks ago it just like opens
bridges that you don't get the longer
that you've been in the place does that
make sense
I will say it is so I need bronzer it
isn't hard to meet people as an adult
way harder than it is in college just
because you have like your circle at
work and then it's basically up to you
to form those other circles where they
meet them at you know the gym or coffee
shops or wherever like friends of
friends and if you move to new cities
you really just need one person you need
one person and that can open up their
whole friend group if you have one
person it is so much easier to go do
things I mean when I was living in
Israel I did everything by myself so I
didn't know anyone at first and then you
just meet people and it gets easier and
sometimes it's really discouraging
because you feel like you're not meeting
anyone especially if you're like me I'm
actually an introvert I'm an extroverted
introvert which is a thing google it I
can force myself to be extroverted after
I do that it is mentally exhausting to
me I love being alone so it can be hard
like I definitely have to force myself
to do those kinds of things I'm
traveling and when I'm just in Seattle
to just went in with the MUA eyebrow kit
that I used some hidden drugstore video
I've been loving the shade of the
contour it is perfect but that's one of
the things I feel like that traveling
alone taught me how to do yeah I think
it's funny because a lot of people think
if you do YouTube you're like super
extroverted you love being the center of
attention you love being around the
camera and all this stuff and for me
it's actually the opposite right now I'm
sitting in a room by myself distance it
feels like you're not talking to
thousands of people if I had to get up
in front of even 15 people and like do a
toe
or something like I hate that I
don't like that at all I've never
enjoyed having attention on these but
sometimes you just have to suck it up
and do it especially in work situations
I had to learn how to talk and furnace
people just kind of have to fake it till
you make it if you try and exude
confidence when you're talking in front
of people people don't know that you're
internally freaking out how did we even
get started talking about that I feel
like I could make a whole shadow and
schmooze video just about introverts and
extroverts I find it so fascinating
rachel says how long does it take you to
edit a video what's your least favorite
part about editing is that weird
watching yourself to edit a shadow in
shmoop it takes longer because I have so
much footage to go through and cut out
and I just get totally sick of hearing
myself talk think i'ma try out this moon
play cosmetic stroboscope it says hyper
flash or foot powder this is a lady
goldfish it's quite the name i unbox
this on snapchat and this I think is my
favorite packaging I've ever seen I do
not know what shape is going to be but I
might shine use it as like a highlight
slash blush topper or something whoa
this is like straight-up gold okay this
might be really pretty
I don't think packaging of this is very
possible for a highlight looks kind of
an electronic Apple is out anyways it
takes me longer to edit a shadow in
commune's video shadowing schmooze it
usually takes me about at least three
and a half hours usually four hours to
edit other videos like foundation Friday
videos cake I would say minimum two
hours the quickest I can usually edit
any videos two hours and that is if I'm
like totally in it to win it going as
fast as I can
very pretty on my skin tone it looks a
little bit yellowy
and what does she say what is your least
favorite part of editing with your least
favorite part about editing I would say
editing itself I think my least favorite
part of YouTube is editing to be honest
I really don't like editing I like every
aspect which is a thing I think editing
creatively is different like if you have
a fun video that you're working on or
like sometimes I like editing routine
videos or try and hauls and stuff we can
get a little bit more creative with it
but you're just editing like a
foundation review or something it's
pretty repetitive I already primed my
eyes before when I was putting on my
foundation primer so I'm just going to
go in with a shadow creases would you
ever consider blogging not necessarily
daily just random vlogs here and there
you
a really chill person and I think a lot
of people would like to know a little
bit more view outside of makeup
obviously you don't have to if you want
to keep stuff private but it might be
interesting if you're up for it well
thank you yeah I like vlogging I've
never would a leave log ever I just
don't want that much of my life on the
internet for forever this is new this is
the elf matte format - palette I love
the matte format palette and this one is
like super pretty warm tones so I'm
going to go in with these and then I
think as a BH Cosmetics palette that
we're going to use I feel like I put up
vlogs once so every month and a half
once every two months maybe let me know
down below if you guys want more
frequent vlogs I don't think I would do
like weekly vlogging but maybe like once
a month or something it's funny because
when you make videos you assume that
everyone watching your video has seen
every video but there's tons of people
all the time who are new who don't
actually know you Beyond makeup videos
or whatever so they feel like vlogs are
a good way to show more who you are away
what am i doing to address so it's not
the brush this pencil is too light for
me now that my top of my hair is dark
again but it's all I have here so reason
it makes around the home front which by
the way thank you she did a review on
1548 I'll link it down below what is
your absolute absolute go-to foundation
the one you reach for most I'm going to
be having a whole video coming out about
that so I'm not going to talk about it
now but she also asks you ever plan to
move out on your own
I'm assuming you mean without a roommate
I personally really enjoy having a
roommate and I also just like having
someone like tonight we're just going to
the movies together it's just night time
or someone to like do small things but
sometimes top five beauty gurus you
watch not just watch the federer but
gurus Shan EXO definitely one of my
favorites for years so good maybe we
should focus on eyebrows Mallory 17 12
Mallory's one of my good friends I love
her to death she is great she's great
person but she also makes really good
content
Katie Holmes I watched her for years and
I still really love her videos to watch
a lot of makeup videos but my favorite
favorite bloggers or YouTube content
creators but most part I don't think
really makes Beauty content Shannon says
does your dad know how much the baby
read have family loves him seriously his
voiceover was hilarious and he seemed
super sweet in your blog he texts me
every couple days being like we're up to
60 K up to 8,000 like you so stoked on
it he's just loving it I'm going to ask
if I
I have tattooed eyebrows and I do I have
a whole video on getting permanent
eyebrows I'll link it down below bag I
go to carry at fine line studios in
Pacific Beach in San Diego
she is amazing I highly recommend her
she's just super talented and if you
guys go to her tell her that I sent you
I'm super happy with my permanent brows
I students do still fill them in a
little bit just because a lot of times
when I wear full on foundation it covers
them up but I love but when I just like
running out the door and I just want to
put on concealer or something it is so
nice having your brows done it's like it
changes your whole look and shape of
your face so I am very happy with them
Tiffany says question for your next
shadow move how do you normally respond
to people who think makeup is frivolous
or shallow I love makeup and often find
the act of applying it calming but I
think makeup often gets dismissed as
being shallow I totally agree with you
as much as you can if you if they're
someone like closer you can educate them
on how it is an art form for a lot of
people just a form of self-expression
I actually haven't had a whole lot of
people tell me that in real life but you
can tell sometimes especially when
people ask what kind of videos I make
and I say Beauty videos that is when I
feel like I get some kind of oh just
Beauty videos something about thank you
to your makeup just makes people kind of
dismiss it going in with the shade third
over but my answer to that what do you
do I would just honestly say them
like who cares people are going to think
what they think you enjoyed wearing
makeup then so be it do it kdg says what
have you major in college what is your
full-time job I went in depth about my
career and college and like a whole
motivational speech basically in the
last shadow in truth video so I'll put
that in the I which is on this side I'll
put it in the eyes but if you haven't
seen that foundations I'd go watch it
because I'm not gonna touch on that
since I did a whole thing on it last
time taking this second shade right here
which is a little bit darker Shani Raimi
says what is your fate Romney probably
what is your favorite of both genre to
read favorite book series lately my
favorite book genre has as corny as it
sounds in like romance but Colleen
Hoover is amazing Colleen Hoover is on
my favorite authors I don't know what
you would technically call it it's
romance but it's there's a lot more
depth to it than just that November 9th
and too soon are my two favorite books
by her that I've read so far I've read
about five of her books too soon I
almost think might pull ahead of
November ninth but November 9th is a
good one if you're like not into reading
and you want a book to get you excited
about reading read November 9th
it is so addicting and it's so good mjd
luck says what is your dream guy like
Taylor I think my main must have is
smart I'm like really attracted to
really smart people and really motivated
people there's nothing more attractive
to me than someone who is super
passionate about something and just does
it and then also a big must on the list
is like to travel I don't know if I want
to live in the u.s. for the rest of my
life I kind of want my kids to be raised
at least for some portion of their lives
in a different country just to be
exposed to it and as far as like
physical stuff I really don't have any
besides tall I usually more into tall
guys which is ironic because in 411 but
I don't really have any specific like
physical things if you know someone that
fits these qualifications hook a sister
up take on I think this warranty shade
maybe this deeper one to kind of mix
them what is this brush this a scratchy
otech sense thing with a pause on me
I'll tell it and let's go in with this
BH palette this palette I'm pretty sure
is under 15 bucks I think I've seen as
well as like 10 bucks when it's on sale
and these are beautiful beautiful foiled
shimmery shadows I don't want to do
something wild what if I did this super
bright purple to this kind of like Bruce
is this Bruce what is this it will do
mint yeah let's do that
Lindsey cheater says how long do you see
yourself continuing with YouTube and
would you ever consider starting a
foundation makeup line I'm going to
continue doing YouTube as long as I'm
still enjoying it which I don't see that
changing in the foreseeable future you
never know but right now I'm really
enjoying youtube or also would be doing
it I don't know if I would ever do
full-on makeup line but definitely
thought about looking in till doing
foundation and mixers and concealer and
everything so she goes up what I'm most
excited about Nicki says my question is
I just started a channel but it seems
like it's taking forever to get
subscribers makeup is my passion do you
think
I keep up on it that the subscribers
will come so if you just started your
channel but it's taking forever to get
subscribers welcome to YouTube it takes
years it takes years folks
a lot of people don't understand that I
think it's easy as I think you just
upload content and it appears overnight
no that's not how it works
it takes a long-ass time and you just
got to keep doing it I would say think
of creative ways that you can get your
videos out there for example on like
different forums or reddit or tumblr or
like responding to thread Amazon reviews
whatever it is think about different
ways that you can get your content in
front of an audience without being
obnoxious there's the right way to do
that and a wrong way to do that please
don't spam people's comment section with
your channel not only is it annoying and
half the time it does go into YouTube
spam filter so it's a waste of your time
to begin with but a lot of times it just
is a little bit disrespectful to be
promoting your stuff on someone else's
comment section it's just not the best
practice unless you do it in a way where
it's related and you think it can
actually be beneficial to people so yeah
it just it takes years it takes a long
time so you're not going to see
subscribers right away and you're just
gonna have to keep doing it and if you
love it enough you will that was the
shade right here I'm going to take a
tiny bit of this one on my finger and
just put it right on the center so I'm
going to take the white right here
misspell it all so back to that question
I talked about this before but if you're
starting out right now start out on
Instagram do not try and full you just
start out on YouTube especially with
Instagram video it's just way easier to
be discovered right now than on YouTube
ooh that's pretty
so I'm taking what I should take this
shade again this orange shade and just
kind of blending out that top creates a
little bit this reminds me of like a
winter mermaid so like that's something
I would have made one of my tutorials
when I first started youtube I'm going
to take the second hour shade and blend
this on the lower lashline I'm like an
adult shadows blend out easily take a
tiny bit tiny tiny bit of this purple in
here and just blend that down eat more
cake says what's your thoughts on
eyelash extensions I would love to get
our last response
if I didn't film so much just doesn't
make sense for all the eye makeup stuff
I do like it would just be a pain in the
ass and they were just fall out but I
love the way they look I love that you
can just wake up and go my eyes though
are super sensitive to lash glue I
should take my lashes off after like two
or three hours I'd be a little bit
worried that if I put them on it would
totally irritate my eyes so liquid liner
I'm gonna use the Catrice liquid liner
waterproof don't leave me pen I did a
full one brand tutorial using Catrice
product wing moves are on I'm going off
some Too Faced better than sex mascara I
think I am going to put falsies on today
but I only have literally one pair here
so I'm just using whatever I have
desperately need to wash my hair I know
so what's up so I have to argue
Omega volume to 50s those are the only
ones I have here actually I'm like
slouching right okay T Williams says how
old are you I'm 24
Jerry Lynn 86 says do you have any pets
what kind I do not have any pets at my
house my parents just got a new puppy
named Parker he is a mini Aussie and he
is the sweetest saying I miss him every
day our old dog was super not social and
like not a normal dog he like hates
everyone but this dog is perfect to you
so I love him so much I really want a
foster dog but my roommate is fed into
dogs at all but I love dogs they're my
favorite I can appreciate cats from far
away I just like don't want them in my
life what is your natural hair color
Miko says my natural hair color
strawberry blonde cut it black for over
10 years now oh my gosh like 12 years
Melissa sighs do you have any tattoos if
not what would you get I do not have any
tattoos if I did get something I would
get one in half Hebrew half Arabic I
have a quote that I would get I just
feel like in the next few years there's
got to be someone who comes out with a
more temporary ink and I'm just holding
out for it I actually saw one was like
going through it almost as relief I love
the way tattoos look I just don't know
for me personally if I would want it the
same thing on my body for the rest of my
life nothing against people who have
them I think they're beautiful
Caitlin roll estrela's which by the way
she always smacked me and I feel like
girl so she has three questions first
you do you think you'll be moving
anytime soon and I kind of talked about
this and the last one I kind of do I
kind of do think I'll be moving soon I
don't know even though both of my jobs
are something that could technically do
remote it is trickier with YouTube just
because of product releases and like
getting products right away when they
come out and reviewing them especially
foundations are a big part of my channel
so it would be a little bit tricky to do
that from another country or like
without having a permanent address we'll
see I've been thinking a lot about it
though then she said three boyfriend yet
no boyfriend Sandra says what kind of
music do you listen to and do you plan
in any instrument I grew up playing
piano I actually played piano for like
10 years I'm a favorite 20th oh yeah I
hardcore played piano by hardcore I mean
my parents forced me to practice every
single day throwing up what kind of
music do you listen to I would say my
favorite artist is Odessa I love it at
that it's just like always put me in a
good mood but they're still chill but
they're also pump up Kelly Walton says
favorite restaurant in Seattle I just
want to say thank you for all the hard
work you put into your channel it
definitely shows thank you I really
appreciate that and favorite restaurant
in Seattle that's hard but I think list
in Belltown is definitely one of my
favorites
they have unreal happy hour food you can
get steak in no pee for like under ten
bucks and it is bomb is really tiny
though so you have to go earlier out
there's going to be five billion people
in line you go in with bottom mascara
I'm using my Wet n Wild mega length
cherry red three one four says what is
the hardest thing about being on YouTube
hello must ellipse so Lancome came out
with use metallic lip gloss things look
this is brush gold - the purple one is
lavender patina and then this Rose kind
of shade is mirrored - nude so you want
to put on like a basic nude lipstick
underneath and then go in with one of
these I'm going to try Kylie Malibu I
can't remember what this looks like
I use this in forever how that works
hardest thing about being on YouTube
for me personally is actually that I
feel like it affects my relationships in
real life because people in my realize
that I'm friends with know everything
that I'm doing they know everything that
I'm up to and they don't feel the need
as much
reach out and ask and toss because they
already know when I don't know anything
going on in their life unless they're
posting about it I feel like it's
affected some relationships in my life
where it kind of made some of them like
more one-sided I think that's the
hardest thing for me it kind of like
just a matte look right now with this
super shimmery eye but I'm really
curious about the whoa this is like
straight-up
gold super sticky so these smell like
straight-up chemicals and I can taste it
I think this is the most intense
chemical scent I've had on my lips ever
I feel like I am drinking a bucket of
chemicals right now I'm working that off
sorry Lancome not a fan of that one when
you use some Urban Decay all nighter
before we wrap this up I also want to
let you know that when this video is
going up on Monday I'm actually going to
be in Spokane with Project VD share
which is super exciting they're flying
me out there to meet them and look at
the warehouse and everything and I think
we're actually doing like possibly a new
segment thing if you want to follow
along with that you can follow me on
snapchat all my social media handles are
right here I'm remove snapping on there

the organization that the proceeds of
the 15 is the foundation t-shirts went
to it get send in gently use makeup to
them and they distribute it to women
