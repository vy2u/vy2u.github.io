fake hair to my eyeballs smells like a
buttered croissant to me
all right so today we're doing a
Valentine's Day themed shadow and
schmooze I asked you guys on Facebook to
ask any Valentine's Day related
questions or topics you want talked
about relationships dating the single
life everything we're getting into it I
wanted to do a Valentine's Day look that
you guys could wear for Valentine's Day
obviously and the eyeshadows I used are
all very affordable so I hope you guys
enjoy this video if you do while you're
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the BAE Rito family and subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time I have lots of shadow
inch mooses telling the playlist down
below if you want to watch any others
but I did a major like life catch-up in
the last shadow mousse which was only a
couple weeks ago this one's like less of
a life update and more of a dating
therapy session for myself it felt like
I have my Valentine's Day themed mug
here going all out so I wash and
moisturize my face I actually tried this
pixie Rose flash bomb instant skin
booster it says that you can use this as
like a moisturizer a treatment primer or
a face mask which is pretty cool
three-in-one I'm going to do some pore
filling though with my favorite Revlon
pore reducing primer a lot of you guys
have been loving this primer so that
makes me happy there's a few different
versions of this Revlon ones so make
sure you get the pore reducing if that's
what you're going for it totally works I
mean look at the difference between that
side in that side so have a bunch of
topics lash questions that you guys
asked on Facebook relating to love my
spray my face with the coconut mac fix+
some as in like half the bottle not
quite awake yet today I have like 5000
appointments so I'm trying to get
filming done I have like literally 3
eyelash extensions left on neither eye
right so while that's drying we need
more coffee ok my skin feels nice and
perhaps I'm gonna try out this
foundation this one I think I got in
Vienna it's the look by Biba liquid nude
serum foundation this was the lightest
shade 10 ohh
just little beads in there I picked up a
few foundations while I was there and I
was gonna do a foundation Friday on this
one but then I looked it up and I can't
find this online at all I have fresh
clean brushes right now I'm so excited I
show you guys how I clean my makeup
brushes in my latest
vlog that one up last week as a bonus
video I also showed my nighttime oh wait
I want to try this this is the Becca
under eye primer I'm very curious about
this looks like it's just a solid kind
of bomb thing I don't know how much
you're supposed to put on but I'm gonna
prime the under eyes with this I already
have on the sunday Riley autocorrect
under there
it just feels super thin it doesn't look
like it's really filling in the lines of
a lot smells like candy cotton candy
this actually feels pretty thick much
thicker than I thought like it's not
moving on there what was I just about to
say oh I showed how to clean my makeup
brushes in the blog that went up last
week and in that vlog I also kind of
showed what my nighttime skincare
routine has been I swear this smells
like cotton candy - nope maybe he's my
brush nope I'm just smelling me i primer
so it's like clinging a little bit yeah
weird on my chin what the heck oh that
doesn't all look good
clinging around there - I might just put
this down on the other side to even it
out and then go in with something on top
of it oh no okay this is a no I'm I
switch to the NARS radiant I've been
liking this it's kind of growing on me
but I feel like I do still need to find
a really good primer slash setting spray
combo with it because my forehead looks
a little bit funky but House Beautiful
coverage concealer I want to try again
the Estee Lauder Double Wear concealer I
use this in a first impressions or
something a while ago and I have not
tried it again since so I don't even
remember what I think of it so this will
be like the first impression all over
again okay we need to get these
questions going every time I reopen
Facebook it exits out of all the
comments sweet okay so as I guess I'd
want to know what is your ideal guy in a
definite deal-breaker in a partner slash
relationship my perfect a guy would be
someone who is funny smart motivated and
just has a good heart
and would be a good dad I'm definitely
more introverted so I really like guys
who are more extroverted and social and
funny and just have that vibe to them
every guy I've been in a relationship
with in the past has definitely been
more like that alright that concealer
doesn't like the best doesn't look the
worst
my mom and I actually did the mom tag a
while ago like a couple years ago now so
I'm gonna link that down below because
we talked a lot about this kind of stuff
in that video but she actually answers
what she thinks my perfect guy would be
and it was pretty spot-on
pretty good looking really sweet guys
with sense good sense of humor very
comfortable with themselves Callan
Kaelin says that's a really pretty name
Kim says what's your best and worst
Valentine's Day dates I think my best
Valentine's Day day was actually in high
school dating this guy in high school
there's just one of those people who was
really creative and like thoughtful with
the things that he would do I like came
home from school and there was a sign
like a little banner thing over my bed
saying I love you and then there were
chocolate-covered homemade strawberries
in there and like something else and I
just don't know that one for some reason
like really sticks out to me I would
much rather prefer someone doing
something that is just more thoughtful
and like handmade then going to like a
hell a nice dinner and doing all that
stuff I don't know my worst Valentine's
Day date I want to tell you guys but I
don't think I'm going to because I'm
pretty sure he watches some of my videos
maybe I don't want to make him feel bad
it wasn't horrible it was just wasn't
the best Allison says do you get any
weird or creepy DMS from guys and how do
you handle it yeah not like a not a huge
amount but when I do I just ignore it
there's a couple guys who comment that I
keep meaning to block you can't block
people from your phone and like your
cell phone so you have to do on the
computer so every time I'm checking
comments and I see someone I just forget
to go in the computer and block them I
kind of want to try using the j-cap
pearl Luminizer as an all-over face
powder just with this huge fluffy brush
this I've been obsessed with as a
highlighter this is like six bucks and
it is amazeballs you guys I might need
to mix it with another powder but I also
I'm just feeling too lazy to do that
right now so I think I'm just gonna pour
it in the lid of this for
I'm a powder and just kind of makes it
good with a big fluffy brush that kind
of looks like the cover effects
illuminating setting powder you just got
to be careful they don't get any it's
kind of like sticking to certain spots
so if you just blend it looks pretty
nice amber says you recently made a
comment about how you're so much better
at long-distance relationships is that
because of your very independent nature
I truly appreciate indepence berries
thank you I'm going to try out the
Maybelline total temptation brow product
wow that's an interesting spoolie okay
this is like diamond shaped that's
interesting probably I like a lot of
aspects of long-distance relationships
honestly I feel like what I've talked
about in other videos you just learned
to build communication I really enjoy
like the anticipation so like doing your
own thing having your own time but then
being really excited to see each other
it just makes you appreciate the time
that you have but at the same time the
goal of long-distance relationships is
to be in the same place together right
my friend I always say like my ideal
marriage would be someone who travels a
lot for work because then I would have
that like independence factor and time
to myself and everything but then if
you're really exciting when we see each
other and also I travel a lot and I've
gone a lot so I don't know I just feel
like that would work out I'm gonna cut
that out I just went way on a rant about
Erin says what are the best non
transferring lipsticks to wear on a date
check out my best red lipsticks video
because all those are formulas that are
bombed that won't transfer Luisa says do
you think you'll ever get married does
Ray slash ethnicity matter to you in a
suitable partner so race and ethnicity
does not matter to me at all I feel like
you're attracted to who you're attracted
to
it's not like I go out seeking one type
of person if you're feeling it with
someone you're feeling it with someone
you know and do I ever think I'll get
married man I hope so this brow is a
little bit too pigmented for me you have
to do really light strokes and also I
think that's not this bully I think the
color is a little bit too gray for me I
think it's something like warmth in
there a little bit I'm gonna go through
my older brow gel something that a few
years ago whenever I heard women talking
about this I
always kind of just rolled my eyes but
it is true that as you get a little bit
more up there in your 20s there's a lot
of pressure not really from my family at
all that was one of the questions
actually if my parents like asked me and
my family asked me they asked me if
there are any new guys but it's not like
pressure to get married and start having
two kids and stuff at all honestly the
pressure just comes from knowing that
you kind of have to have kids by certain
age and then looking at that timeline if
it weren't for that I don't think I
would feel nearly as much pressure as I
do right now I'm gonna try this circus
champagne beach as kind of like a
bronzer I use this a long time ago don't
remember what I thought of it I don't
even know if Walgreens still carries
they're good do they well definitely
quite a warm tone but that's pretty if
you're in your mid twenties comment down
below let me know if you're feeling it
too because especially in the last year
if you only have one friend who is
single I don't mind being single I'm
just in a place where I'm ready to be in
a relationship and I'm ready to have a
relationship that I know is going
somewhere I don't run s acerra ly feel
the pressure to like get married and
have kids within the next two or three
years because I just don't feel like
that's really my timeline I don't think
that's necessarily something I want in
the next few years but I do want to be
in a relationship that eventually those
things will come with I do believe that
everything you do leads yet to something
else for some kind of reason because
there are just so many things in my life
that I could not have planned and things
that happened led me to different places
where I met different people and end up
doing totally different things and I
thought I was gonna be doing so I
totally believe in just timing doing
your own thing and hopefully that'll
attract the right people into your life
and so far I feel like it has but not
gonna lie it is very hard to meet people
it can be really frustrating so I'm
gonna go with mac free soul blush this
is such a pretty like glowy light pink
shade I've been in love with this it
gives you like a glowy highlight too
this is so pretty
whoo sarah has a couple good question
she says what are your biggest
deal-breakers in a relationship and what
are some relationship lessons you have
learned from Mama and Papa burrito I'm
gonna start with the second question I
feel like a lot of
I expect out of relationship comes from
my parents obviously I think that's
pretty normal and I was very fortunate
to grow up with two parents who might
from what I saw have a great
relationship
what highlight do I want to use I guess
we'll just use the same Jake at once and
sorry out I love how it goes on you
think it's gonna be like way too intense
and then it just totally melts into your
skin and you can really build this thing
up to I feel like I'm reading questions
and then they literally just go out of
my brain I think something that I always
admired about my parents relationship
was that they it seems like they always
try and find things to do together that
they both really enjoy which seems small
but I feel like when you're with someone
for that long you probably do have to
make an effort like my dad taught my mom
how to surf so that they could serve
together by the way this brush I always
get asked about this is a Kat Von D
brush number forty I need to add this I
don't think this one's in the
description box but this was on those
brushes when I first got where I was
like what in the hell am I gonna use
this thing for and it's actually balm
for applying eye primer if you don't
like digging your finger in the pot this
is great for that in just the shape of
it since its kind of tapered down you
can just place it right in your inner
primer in our inner corner caffeine
levels like negative 20 right now and
they just have fun together like my
parents do a lot of things with they
have a lot of friends and they do a lot
of things with their friends together so
I think that's cool
they have like a few different friend
groups my parents literally party more
than I do I swear they have something
every single night the other question
was what are your biggest deal-breakers
in relationship obviously someone who I
can't trust trust is like number one for
me I'm gonna go with the BH Cosmetics
zodiac palette I did like a light blue
kind of wintery look with this in a
different shadow run schmooze actually
that might might have been the shadow in
schmooze where I talk about
relationships and everything
can't remember here's the palette I'm
gonna go with this tan shade and then
probably the pink actually now I'm gonna
start out with that pink and put that
into the crease
I don't know how bold we're gonna get
with this look so pretty if the trust
wasn't there that would definitely be a
deal-breaker cheating I have a really
hard time getting over cheating because
I just think you're in that mind space
just end the relationship
don't cheat just end it and then go go
to
thing with the other person because I
would personally have such a hard time
trusting someone after that that I think
if the trust would just be gone and that
would be really hard to repair
I think another deal-breaker for me is
someone who's really pessimistic I just
can't handle that I just think as of
right now in 2018 at least we only have
one chance at life you only get one
chance to do this thing so why not make
the best of it given what you're dealt
so people who don't look at life that
way I think would be really hard for me
to have a long lasting relationship with
I really love people who just make the
most out of every situation that they're
in you just blend out so fricken easily
like that 2 seconds so I'm taking that
tan shape now we're kind of going in
Reverse I mean obviously like
deal-breakers that should be
deal-breakers for anyone like someone
who doesn't treat you well please leave
now I'm gonna take a woo sliding off the
table it's not like a darker pink or red
in the BH palette so I'm just gonna take
the shade from the kathleenlights
palette which I haven't used yet having
a shade palette alright Rua asked a
question kind of like what we were
talking about early she said how to deal
with and your friends are married with
children you're and you're just they're
getting lots of sleep alone of course
girl I feel you I feel you something I
do is listen to podcast I really like
the I don't get it podcast podcast that
talked about this kind of thing oh my
god heck yeah that just brought it all
together scrubbing in with Becca Tilly
podcast it talked about dating and being
single and all that because you just
realize that you're not the only one and
it's freaking hard to date in 2018 these
are all blending together so beautifully
right now there's some stuff about like
anti Valentine's Day and you know I get
that but I also feel like what I try and
do on Valentine's Day is do things to
Hallmark holiday whatever we all know
that but I try and just think of it as
focusing on love not necessarily
relationships you know so be with people
you love and try not to get into a
depressive hole about being single that
is the goal Valentine's Day I'm putting
Leo which is that pinkish purplish shade
right on the lid okay I think I just
need to chug this cup right now
I ordered this it's like a Yeti knockoff
the kind of thing I guess or just
different brand called beast I got this
off of Amazon this thing keeps your
drinks cold for hours like I put ice in
at night with water and the ice is still
floating in it in the morning it's
pretty great I want to wet my brush and
go back in with that same shade just get
it to really pop I'm gonna take mac fix+
oh my gosh what these are insane Oh a
little accutane update i think i'm gonna
be doing a four month update which will
basically talk about months three and
four so I'm not sure if that will be up
before this video but it'll be coming
got my bloodwork done yesterday and my
accutane appointment is tomorrow to go
over it so I'm gonna go over the results
and stuff for you guys in the four-month
update so I want to keep the waterline
pretty bright and open so I'm gonna go
in with a nude liner on there nicole
says are you planning on doing any
wedding makeup looks in the future slash
pretty recommendation that you would
pick for a big event event such as a
wedding I do definitely want to do a
wedding video for so long I still have
like the fake what's it called veil and
everything in this IKEA drawer in front
of me from like two years ago that's how
long I've been planning on doing this
video but I've been putting it off
because whatever kind of routine I
recommend for you guys
I want to thoroughly test it because I
wouldn't want you to go out and get
those products and then have it not last
all day and not look amazing because
it's your wedding day so that's why that
video is taking so long I need to just
nail down the products figure it out and
test it it's just I test things almost
every single day so it's just finding a
chunk of time to do that as far as what
foundation I would recommend that's
really hard to say whenever you guys not
me saying what foundation do you
recommend it's so hard to say because I
don't know your skin type I don't know
what kind of coverage you like I don't
know what you're putting underneath it
and on top of it and I feel like those
things are what really makes or breaks a
foundational all the time so it's really
hard for me to say one foundation but I
would say just try out different
foundations go to Sephora and get
samples of different ones see what you
like see what you don't like on myself
right now what I would probably use is
the dermablend smooth liquid camo I have
to lighten this so I probably mix it
with the CYO long-lasting because these
two lost forever on my skin
look beautiful they smooth out the
texture and everything and they just
look Bom oh wait you know what I might
take back my answer to the best
Valentine's Day one I had a Valentine's
Day thing in college that was totally
unexpected it was this guy was really
good friends with that showed up with
like roses and stuff I feel like that's
the kind of Valentine's Day where you
hear things like that happening but
you're like oh that's never gonna happen
to me it was just so surprising and so
sweet we kind of dated after that I'm
gonna put on a thin coat of mascara I
want to try out this the Maybelline
total temptation keep in mind my
eyelashes right now are very short and
slightly non-existent I've heard this
smells like coconut and it doesn't look
good it smells like a buttered croissant
to me oh I'm excited to use this when
all the extensions are out because it's
actually making me look like I have a
few lashes there I'm gonna use pure
divas these are one of my favorites oh I
like this okay so Jessica says are you
ready to find your person oh why do you
think you plan to settle down I wanted
to be married with my child by 25 but
things didn't work out that early I'm 35
and married expecting a child and at
this age kind of glad I didn't settle in
my mid 20s I I kind of totally agree
with you I mean I think that it just
depends on the person I think settling
down means different things for
different people for me it just means
finding that one person that you want to
live life with I don't really want to
settle down in the sense that I want to
have a house and I want to be in the
same place forever not that there's
anything wrong with that I think
different people just want different
things out of life so I don't know on
one hand I have friends who have been
with the same person since college and
they're clearly like that's their person
and I think they're great together and I
think you know that's like a case where
if they waited till they're 30 what they
have met someone else that they would be
more compatible with who knows like you
really don't you don't know I don't
really have the answer this I just know
for myself it's just a kind of thing
where if I meet someone and I know then
I know and if they want the same things
out of life then great let's do this and
whether that's when I'm 25 this year or
if I'm 30 then happens when it happens
but hopefully it happens I totally don't
you mean though I think even in the last
year my thoughts on marriage and just
what I want I think I've changed and
just truly if you really think about
what you need and want out of a partner
is getting real deep as I'm gluing fake
hair to my eyeballs what do you order
for food on first dates some food just
wipes makeup right off and then salad
can be awkward to eat gracefully I love
your videos so much Thank You Myra I
really don't think too hard into it I
just order whatever sounds good I love
food I love eating so if someone can't
appreciate that I'm not gonna order
something dainty to put in my mouth then
you know peace out
there's a lot of questions about if I
have online dating profiles if I use
apps all that stuff yeah I totally use
tinder Bumble I have Jay swipe on my
phone but in Seattle it's pretty
horrible
I honestly swipe right probably one in
like a hundred people and then out of
those people people don't freaking talk
on apps anymore it's such a waste of
time I'm like why are you wasting your
time swiping and matching if you're not
gonna say anything and sometimes I'll
just message and say something and then
even then there's no response like bro
just delete the app if you're not
actually gonna use it for something
think everyone's kind of getting sick of
the dating apps when I first moved to
Seattle they were popping and now it's
like everyone's either off it because I
found someone or they're just over it oh
I hate when you missed a little corner
of glue great yeah my watering so the
glue is not sticking this sucker does
not want to be on my eye right now
all right 500,000 years later I went to
put on some bottom mascara wet-and-wild
Magelang I don't even know if this lash
is on my face your lips I think I want
to try this pixie liquid lipstick and
pastel petal I haven't tried this yet I
want something like a dark nude but with
a little bit of pink in it so I'll
probably end up layering this I think
whoa very bendy brush like look at this
not the best for a liquid lipstick so
I'm not a fan of the scent of this
really pretty color though and it feels
almost like buttery going on in a way
the tip is really hard to control
because it's so flimsy just into
Valentine's Day spirit you know super
pretty color I don't even know if I want
to layer anything on here I think I want
a little bit gloss like a light pink
let's try the Mack Patrick Starr glass
this looks like a really pretty color oh
yeah that goes perfect with this shade
all right so I think this is the final
look if you wanted this to be a little
bit more nighttime dramatic you could
easily just add a winged liner and I
feel like that would definitely spice it
up a little bit or you could do a deeper
lip color like a deep dark purple you
pink shade I feel like would look pretty
with this but everything I used on my
face today will be listed down below
this dress by the way is from Target I'm
not sure if they still have it I got it
I actually got it in winter I don't know
why they were selling a dress like this
in the winter I probably still have it
I'll link it online if I can find it but
it's like an off-the-shoulder or you can
wear it up here super cute velvet rosy
kind of flowers on it but I hope you
