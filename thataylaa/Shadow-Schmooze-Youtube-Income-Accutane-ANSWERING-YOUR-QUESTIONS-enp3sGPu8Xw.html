all right so today we're doing a shadow
and schmooze on this look I'm also
answering guys's questions from Twitter
no idea has happened wasn't really
anticipating this kind of look this look
up pretty intense pretty quick 99% the
products I'm using today our first
impressions I'm also trying out ton of
brushes from BH Cosmetics I have to
brush sets here so if you guys enjoy
this video while you're watching don't
forget to give it a thumbs up that was a
really high pitched up I am going to go
eat a burrito alright guys it has been a
day but I'm really excited to just sit
down and talk to you guys and try out
new makeup got my matcha tea here it's
actually pretty late in the day I
usually film first thing in the morning
but it's 3 p.m. right now cut a crazy
morning a little bit stressed a little
bit overwhelmed but I'm feeling the
chill just shadow and schmooze Sports
broad tanked up for Day here right now
after guys on Twitter to send any
questions that you want answered someone
answer a few of those fissured all just
to set the foundation I'm going to be
using is also first impressions so this
should be a good time let's go started
off KS TIFF is going to be a boozy
schmooze I think that would be an utter
disaster today if I tried to combine
this with alcohol but maybe next time
let me know if you guys want to do that
this is brand new I'm pretty sure I got
this on Sephora it's the Too Faced
hangover RX three-in-one primer and
setting spray so you can use this to
prime your face and set your makeup do
like the original hangover RS primer but
I've never been like a die-hard fan of
it or anything but I like the smell I
love coconut that just went in my ear
good on the faces Tim shall we it's
super coconutty but not like overpower
this is really wet or maybe just put on
too much mmm kind of smells like
sunscreen but in the best way so you
guys asked some really good questions on
Twitter - holy see that just burn
my eyes would not recommend opening your
eyes until this is dry add some nice
tackiness to it which I like in a primer
so I have these two brush sets I want to
try from BH Cosmetics
one looks like it's more of like kabuki
and then the other is a carnival brush
set Misskelley lien says what's been the
best and worst thing about living
without a roommate now nicely so far
it's freaking great that is going to be
kind of like too quiet maybe it's just
as I've only been in here for a few
weeks so far I'm really enjoying it of a
couple close friends are really close by
so I actually see them more now than I
did in my other apartment if you live in
apartments you know you never really get
like totally used to it because it
like you're never totally done
decorating and you know you're going to
like move in a year or whatever and I
don't know this is the first time where
I've just felt at home right now I'm
mixing the milk blur Foundation which I
did a foundation Friday on with the
makeup forever matte velvet plus in the
shade in the lightest shade this one
oxidizes a lot so I'm hoping this won't
be too dark mixed together I've been
loving the milk foundation I'm just
trying to find the best way to keep me
matte throughout the day so I want to
try mixing this in the apartment or is
definitely coming when you guys are
seeing this I don't think it'll be up
yet what's going down right now is that
I'm basically pre filming a shit-ton for
my normal three videos a week because I
need to start pre filling for 15 days of
foundation like tomorrow a lot of videos
I'm like in the foundation brush by the
way you guys will be saying in this
Friday's foundation Friday video the
next 15 days foundation dates I know you
guys love this series and I love making
this series kind of just like a
two-month period of video chaos for me
because the amount of pre filming to
even start filming so can do at the
foundation intense but I love it it's
fun and I'm glad you guys like it it
looks like there might be kind of a
maybe a concealer brush in here there's
this one it feels a little bit flimsy
for what I usually like for concealer I
just use my sponge or something but I
have a new concealer want to try out
this has been so freaking hard to hold
off of this video to try this this is a
Clinique beyond perfecting super
concealer in the shade very fair super
time YouTube well this is kind of runny
this super yellow feels extremely
lightweight and a little bit runny
actually like a little bit thin for
concealer that looks like light coverage
to me
you can still see freckles and darkness
coming through I still have tried to do
a red liner with liquid lipstick last
night just for fun and it's like still
on my lash line you want a light
coverage super natural looking and
sealing concealer you might like this
because it feels very thin from you this
concealers not my favorite I'll probably
be returning this because I don't see
myself reaching for this ever trying a
new under eye setting powder to I think
I might actually layer a little bit of
concealer just to get more coverage I'm
just going to add a little bit of shape
tape bottles like totally empty it's on
Twitter today that one cup of matcha is
equal to like 10 cups of green tea as
far as antioxidants and everything
reliable sources I don't know why I've
never tried this it's been around for
years and it's got
pretty like rave reviews for yours I
think I've been kind of hesitant to try
it just because I usually don't like
loose powders for my under-eye all the
times it takes away the coverage I feel
like I've said that in every video like
last 10 videos whoops Atmos etruscan my
ELF brush that I use for underneath my
eyes Daniela Montero which by the way
Danielle you're awesome I always see
your tweets thank you appreciate it she
says who are you rooting for on the
Bachelorette
god it's a weird season let me preface
this by saying I was never someone who
was into The Bachelor before like a year
ago or been season two years ago I know
I've been listening to the been and
actually I podcast and I have a newfound
respect for actually I and Ben I don't
know he just seems very humble and
mature and I like what he's using his
platform for I think it's awesome this
season on The Bachelorette I like Peter
the best just not for Rachel I don't
think Peter is for Rachel at all out of
all the guys I do like Peter the best I
think for Rachel herrick no no he just
seems like a genuinely good person I
don't trust the other guy with the other
guy's name if you have that just
darkened it looks white this is almost
always what happens with loose powders
with me and my undereyes ones not
working for my under eyes to brighten it
back up a little bit I'm gonna go in
with my normal sufficient formula okay
this is the nicest tweet Beck's logic
says I don't have any questions just a
general thank you I love how driven you
are to better both yourself in your
community you are so appreciated that's
so sweet I think it's the nicest thing
when you guys take the time to write
things like that I really appreciate it
and I always see you on Twitter and
everything so thank you
Lexus Bennett says graduating college in
a year and I'm my pants lol how
did you transition into the workforce
after graduating that was a major
process for me not the actual transition
just like landing an internship and
making that stuff few years ago and I
was going through that I actually did a
whole video on it I'll link it down
below it's super old but it actually
goes really in-depth about how to
actually land your first job or your
first internship and just things I
learned and want to start looking and
all that kind of stuff so link that down
below because I actually think it's
still applicable and helpful so this is
the Mack next to nothing new powder and
the shade light I think this is like an
illuminating powder it looks beautiful
when you swatch it it has like a little
bit of a sheen to it you guys know I
love my a cosmetics illumination powder
so this is anything like that sign me up
this powder brush feels too flimsy for
what I like someone use on
for less cb4 brush this must be an
all-over face Connor looks nice it gives
you a little bit of a sheen not as much
as a cosmetics cutter kind of like a
translucent powder just with a little
bit of a sheen to it I have a lot of BH
because they send a huge-ass package so
I'm going to try out the studio pro
contour palette the shade right here
looks promising ooh that one looks like
it would be a good eye shadow
what brush drilling is put these kind of
brush is going to make me cringe too
flimsy and this hair hmm not one might
be nice okay let's share that sometimes
not blending that well can't tell if
it's the brush or the product so I'm
going to switch I use this flower Beauty
brush it is so friggin soft I'm going to
try this yeah look at how much better
let's just apply it and blend it up
Rodie says are you going to tune into
Celebrity Big Brother to see how Trisha
Paytas gets on in the house have no
interest in either of those topics it's
a great question miss em break says
what's the worst unsolicited advice
you've ever gotten about your skin I get
them daily on YouTube probably to wash
my face or a drink distilled water think
I've never tried washing my face I do
read every comment sometimes I do get
really good advice about asking me but I
would say like 9 out of 10 in the
comments are just things that are
absolutely absurd or that I've tried for
like years but while we're on the acne
topic I have an update in accutane
department so this is actually going
down now figured out the timing and
everything I basically had to time it
between 15 days of foundation series as
regulus as that sounds this is what I do
so once I was able to figure out the
next two series I'm timing it between
the two basically so your skin gets
super super sensitive and drying
everything on accutane so I'm probably
not going to want to be doing a ton of
foundation videos and stuff call me
Claire says can you do an updated
tanning routine now that you started in
using self-tanner again your girl needs
tips and tricks yeah let me know if you
guys want to see that I've been thinking
about doing a full video on it because
it is hard to find a self-tanner that
doesn't make you look super orange if
you're fair what do you use for acne
scarring slash hyperpigmentation
nothing because at the moment I'm just
trying to get rid of the acne then also
this on the scarring and
hyperpigmentation getting rid of that
and it says what inspired your new
apartment decor
I don't know mix up things I guess I saw
a lot of home people on instagrams is
the HD brow pencil those the questions
Oh
decor I just wanted it a little bit more
eclectic I guess so there's just bullion
here whoops
these shadow and cheese videos I
literally have about two and a half
hours of footage every time that I try
and chop down to like under 25 minutes
so I'm just cranking through the brows
right now but I'm actually really liking
how this is going on nice fine tip and I
like how it's not overly pigmented has a
little bit of like drag to it which I
like my monitors over on the side now
it's actually hard to see exactly what
you guys are seeing like the angles
everything because I'm not looking
straight on if that makes sense
I cannot tell you how friggin amazing it
is to film in this space it's a
different world okay actually want to go
in with my makeup everything I picked
this back up again the other day this is
their brow liner in the shade 0-4 this
thing is awesome for drawing on like the
fake strands of hair that just got a
little crazy over there I'm going to use
some concealer and clean those brows up
and try with this brush like a nice
concealer brush yeah what is that bro
doing can't tell if these are getting
better or worse as time is passing I
haven't tried the stencils again since
that video but I kind of want to wet
them out again because struggle with
pretty much be a vh1 brand tutorial
right now but this is the BH blush in
Bahama bronze use this yesterday and I
really like this it has like a nice
sheen to I just got way too much with
this brush there's a little bit of a
sheen to it but it's nice and kind of
like a peachy but still natural I just
applied way too much I'm back to my
normal brush this is from the Amazon
brush set love this brush I'm gonna hold
off on highlight for now to prime my
eyes I'm on tried the flower Beauty
ultimate eye primer I'm like half asleep
right now guys need like a little bit
more energy for shadow and schmoozers
because you know there's questions and
you gotta come up with answers and
things oh this is like a clear eye
primer not really down with the use but
we'll try it only because they usually
take away any eyelid coverage that one's
not for me this on the other hand I'm in
love with us an eye primer this is the
aqua XL makeup forever
in m-52 this rocks as a base gives you
coverage and you'd like the tiniest
amount go super far Sara nicole says do
you feel like you could rely solely on
YouTube for income and if so do you plan
on doing that in the future I know this
is a topic that people are always really
curious about which I understand because
it's not one of those jobs where you
know exactly how much someone is making
like a doctor or a dentist or whatever
so I totally get it when you're not in a
space it's really difficult to know how
much people are making but my income
from YouTube has been enough to be a
full-time thing for probably about the
past year I would say it's in last year
pretty much I went from like full-time
job and full-time YouTube to as I told
you guys doing like 20 hours a week of
freelance and kind of just tapering it
out all right now I'm at the point where
I do YouTube full-time if I have a
project that comes along that I'm really
excited about and I want to take I do it
just for the stimulation outside of
YouTube YouTube ended tomorrow I would
100% be able to have a full-time career
but right now it's like the ideal
situation because I get to do what I
love and I'm passionate about if I want
to I can take on other work outside of
YouTube as well so I'm just really
satisfied right now I feel like this is
the first time I really had a life
outside of work which feels amazing I
didn't know what it felt like I never
had that is always working like 70 hours
a week doing YouTube and my full-time
job I don't know I feel like I've worked
my ass off for so many years that it
just feels great to finally bet this
point Pierre came out with it sois right
so all right
what can I say Lord I know Diaries look
at this marble packaging marble and rose
gold this is their new eyeshadow palette
you like I've been doing a lot of like
bronzy kind of eyes right now but I
really want to try out this palette I
might add like a pop of color with the
trolls palette it's one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes by the way I don't
know how I feel about this set the
carnival brush set it feels very cheap
II like the handles and everything so
I'm in charge of brushes but I think I
like this set a little bit better these
definitely feel like they have more
what's that word to them I'm gonna start
out with this one though because this is
the bigger blending brush this set
doesn't have like a bigger eye blending
brush I'm gonna start out with the shade
gala right here feel like it's hard to
test out brushes and new products at the
same time because I can't tell what's
the brush and what's the product should
I be doing this I just use a mix but I'm
going to go in with my normal brush for
this there we go
John Adam says this may seem weird but
what toothpaste do you use your teeth
are really white oil I use the Colgate
optic white I love that toothpaste I
have a whole video on my teeth whitening
routine what products I use I'll link
that down below
Mackenzie Brighton says what big trip
are you planning next slip your travel
vlogs last week I actually
a super exciting opportunity for trips
in different country and I think since
I'm going to be over there I'm going to
plan a second trip like on that trip I'm
trying to figure it out I'm not sure
where yet that's in September probably
that Oh miss Liz says when you were a
kid what did you want to be when you
grew up according to my mom if you saw
the mom tag video I wanted to be someone
who sold cotton candy at SeaWorld very
ambitious child but once I got over that
life's goal wanted to be a photographer
at one point I was always really
interested in video and photography
which is funny because if you talk to
any youtuber too much every youtuber
I've talked to about this one of those
kids who would make those like bizarre
home videos think I wanted to be a
pharmacist at some point actually my
freshman year of college for a minute I
debated switching going on like the med
school track I don't think I've ever
told you guys this and then look at that
shape that night my roommate and I which
was rage in college when I went to Panda
Express and I literally got a fortune
cookie that said to reevaluate my life's
plans
Thank You Panda Express needles and
stuff don't bother me I wouldn't say I
get super super squeamish with blood but
I'm definitely not the doctor type tell
you that much I've been in college I
didn't think I was going to be going
into business and marketing and all that
it wasn't till senior year when I
decided that I wanted to work in the
Middle East be an interpreter or work in
the NGO world which I still want to do
to some degree I'm trying to figure out
a way to combine all of this with that
this is the issue of Shadowrun choices
I'm literally not even thinking about to
make it that I'm doing right now I'm
just putting things on my face how nice
would it be for one day to have super
symmetrical eyes like makeup would be so
much easier Emily says are you a Harry
Potter fan and if so what house do you
consider yourself to be in I am actually
like the opposite of a Harry Potter fan
I don't not like Harry Potter I've just
never been into it I think I saw the
first movie and read the first book and
then that was kind of the end of my
Harry Potter journey Brittney Lisa's
what are your biggest worries when you
travel out of the country and what kind
of research do you do I get a lot of
travel questions I still want to do a
whole video on travel tips and all that
I don't know I feel like living in the
Middle East kind of prep you for some
 I don't know I don't really worry a
whole lot about things that can happen
because why worry about a hypothetical
situation I think it's good to be
prepared and always be like cautious the
one thing that does worry me when I
travel is what would happen if I got a
really bad migraine like wearing
- usually go into the ER and I'm like
puking if I'm traveling by myself I have
no idea how that would work is knock on
wood
there's no wood in here I've not had to
deal with that yet and although I think
about the entire year I was in Jordan I
actually never had an ER migraine which
is interesting
I didn't Israel that's different when
you're living somewhere versus when
you're just traveling there like I was
just on like a week trip somewhere it'd
be different than if I was actually
living in a country I need to stop
blending the same damn shade
I've been doing this for like 25 minutes
what am i doing there's my dilemma right
now guys I can use a pop of color on the
eyes but I also kind of want to do like
a fuchsia lip sync I'd rather do a
bolder eye shadow look right now let's
go in with this palette pretty sure you
can still get this pure palette to lay
down the color I'm going to take this
brush and I'll probably give my finger
just add some more I'm really drawn to
the pink again right now even though
I've already done a pink matte look with
the same palette ooh what if I did pink
and orange okay I've no idea how this is
going to go but I want to do the orange
shade right here and like fade it into
pink look at the pigment this palette is
so great oh it's so good I'm like having
an eyeshadow gasm right now I think I'm
going to take this halfway right up into
the crease Alessi says how do you pack
your makeup when you travel I have a
whole video on what's in my travel
makeup bag I'll link that in global eye
over here and download in down down
below in the description box see our
glam inspired says what are you wishing
you before starting YouTube helpful tips
okay I'm going to go in step pink shade
and blend it in I'm not going to wipe
off this brush because I kind of want
that orange tool on there I think what
did I wish I knew before starting
YouTube I gave a lot of YouTube advice
and I think that one of those in the Q&amp;amp;A
video link that down below too but I
really went kind of more in depth on
YouTube advice and stuff in that video
to give you a short quick answer right
now you really just need to dive in and
do it and use Google it's really
interesting me when people say they
don't know how to do something and
that's their excuse for not doing
YouTube because no one knew how to do
those things
research it you learn it you figure it
out really tough to start actually I
think a good lesson that I've learned
from YouTube is that it really teaches
you how to without like over analyzing
everything you say how to think how
everything you're saying is going to be
perceived like every sentence that comes
out of my mouth when I'm on camera I
think about how that would affect
someone if it could be taken a different
way if it's offensive if it's whatever
it is all these things you have to take
into
federación which i think is actually a
good tool for life not really something
I wish I knew but I feel like that's
something that YouTube has taught me
ever is on this brush I'm just blending
with that a little bit this is the color
payoff with just a brush so just a brush
to really get wild I'm going to take it
on my finger now oh my god I'm going to
go back in with this towel and take the
shades lurch I think so I'm gonna put
this right into the crease kind of like
a little tiny cut crease is so hard to
make a cut crease on my eyes because
they look totally different when I
relaxed my eye than when I'm like this
Kendall says how did you get started
with your freelancing consulting not the
decision to do it but actually getting
out there and getting clients so first
it actually wasn't intentional I was
working full-time at a company and had
someone reach out to me who wanted some
freelance work done for something
started doing it extra this is when I
was literally working like 70 80 hours a
week because I'm still doing YouTube I
was doing the freelancing and I was
working full time I had no life anyways
kind of started from there it was going
really well I was making a lot more
money doing that because you can charge
basically double freelance than what you
do if you're working for company
in-house and I just kind of realized
like bending I could do this why aren't
I doing this so from that point I
started getting more clients kind of
just through like word of mouth and my
network here in Seattle is people I've
worked with in the past and everything
they definitely would recommend building
up your resume and portfolio for a few
years before doing freelance because
that's really what you're going to be
showing your future clients what you've
done in the past why don't I just
breathe I want to say you can't go
directly into freelance but you kind of
need the skills and experience in order
to do that alright I really want a boom
highlight for the inner corner I
remember correctly the white shade in
here is like blue yeah it's like a
purpley blue I think I want to take my
whatever face highlight and up using mu
maybe we'll do a glitter okay I don't
know if I want to do glitter first I'm
gonna try the Catrice liquid metal cream
shadow yeah super pretty this is a nice
little small shadow brush right here I'm
going to try out this blue liner this is
by Urban Decay and the shade of vivid
this one I'm really having to layer on
my waterline to get it to show up I'm
going to take this little liner brush
thing I'm going to take that warm brown
shade again calli Cal says ëi for
shadow and shmooze question how do you
feel about online date
Garan a and why I'm all about online
dating because your girl needs to meet
someone the dating life especially in
Seattle is pretty rough there's a thing
in Seattle called the Seattle freeze
which is very real no one talks to each
other it's very bizarre
especially in bars so you kind of have
to rely on online dating as sad as that
is it's just sad that people don't talk
to each other and realize anymore to me
so yeah I'm all about tinder Bumble do
what you got to do I'm just lining this
really closely to the rule lu4 brow bone
highlight thing going to take a shade
Bridgette right here
Davina Zi says how do you push yourself
you already told us that you plan with
your bad times in mind but how do you do
that I really need to acquire that skill
to planners planners are the key to life
I want to give this line or another go
this is the ultimate felt tip liner I
tried this in the Ulta one brand
tutorial time management planning
pretends like is to do tomorrow because
if something comes up or doesn't happen
you still have a few days to make it
happen well that looks janky I also will
incentivize myself with like small silly
things like going to go get coffee or
going on a walk or whatever it is for
some reason when I tie myself to get
something done or like challenge myself
to get it done within a certain amount
of time I'll do it I want to do a little
bit bigger of a wing though
holy seize that wing just got
intense you guys are having one of those
days at the liner you keep getting
bigger and bigger and bigger debating
actually like smudging this out think
I'm going to do it because I don't like
how the lines are looking right now he
needs a black pen more because Lee and I
saw it because this is like the best
black eyeshadow I just want to like
soften up the edges a little bit I think
that helped a little bit I think once I
have lashes on there it'll help hide the
wing a little bit I'm not sure out these
if they're not too intense for this look
because they're the d30 too by BH just
like when those looks I'm just like
hoping comes together at some point
that's great oh my god you've got
full-on like gulp of the matcha powder
not solved like a chaser right now but
it's not a highlight yet
oh now are these lashes too intense
right now well that lash glue is drying
let's pop on some lower lashline mascara
all right cool let's do lips okay
actually putting on clothes now I'm
actually in your highlight before I
forget
use one that never fails me this is the
elf illuminating palette again love this
shade right here my foundation is not
looking good right now I don't really
like that combo much prefer the milk one
on its own or it could have been the
finishing powder the fairy lipstick I
definitely just want to do a nude
because this is happening so I think I'm
going to try the NYX high voltage
lipstick in 21 that'll work
I'm gonna need a little bit darker on
the corners let's give this L'Oreal
liner ago has a shade 112 mastermind
mastermind got it I'm just going to
outline at this I like that L'Oreal
color that liner this is our D major Lee
transferring to my teeth so I never wear
actual lipsticks just with the lipsticks

sure how I feel about the lashes but
just fun just makeup I'm sure you guys
