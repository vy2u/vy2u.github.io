all right so today we have an old-school
style shadow and smooth on the look I'm
wearing right now feel like I need more
caffeine right now if you've never seen
a shadow missionary's on my channel it's
basically where we put on makeup talk
about life I actually asked you guys on
snapchat and Twitter this time around to
ask any questions that you have we have
a ton of new people in the burrito fam
so if you're new comment down below let
me know if this is your first shadow and
schmooze figured this would be a good
time to do kind of a Q&amp;amp;A type of thing
if you want to ask any questions in a
future of shadow insurance videos make
sure you're following me on social media
so that you can ask your questions so
this is the look that I wore in the best
and worst of 15 days of foundation video
if you missed that I will link it in the
little icing which is somewhere over
here still don't know the side I kind of
just use a mix of new products new
products to me new releases if you want
to see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching all right
we got the coffee
we're shadow and true isn't it up today
it is 8 o'clock in the morning so I have
already washed moisturize prime my face
today actually tried a different primer
this is a dr. brandt pores no more pore
refiner one of you guys commented saying
that this is awesome at erasing pores
and i'm trying to erase my pores lately
so we'll see hopefully this doesn't
break me out a lot of primers break me
out but so it looks like it has a little
tint to it but it doesn't actually show
up when it's on your skin it looks
really dark when it comes down the tube
so you guys asked a ton of questions on
Twitter and I have some from snapchat
too so I think I'm just going to go down
the line start answering them as we put
on makeup since I'm going to be talking
answering questions I might not be able
to say exactly what I'm using every
single time so everything will be linked
down below in the description box like
always
everything is always down there that I
use so when you guys are watching this
I'm actually going to be filming the
best and worst of foundations video
today right after I film this so I want
to be wearing one of the foundations
that I talked about some to the mix of
the Clinique continuous coverage with
the LA girl Pro HD white mixer now we're
trying out some of these more feet gold
brushes these are brand new I believe
they launched on Black Friday so they
should be out when you guys are cygnus
it makes leather it will give it I'm
gonna take the y-7 whoops totally just
forgot to say before photo and I'm not
wearing earrings so even with the mixer
this one covers really really well you
need earrings
they are alright let's start answering
Casey Anderson on Twitter says what were
your favorite things to record when you
first started YouTube and are they still
the same thing now or is it something
else
so when I first started YouTube at least
good some of you guys have told me that
you have been following me for this long
and actually met someone in Seattle the
other day who said that she watched
these videos but when I first started I
did a lot of rant videos they're called
Taylor rants I think there's still a few
up if we are looking back on those I
feel like I'm a hundred percent
different person now but that's kind of
the crazy thing about putting yourself
online is it you do see those changes
and those changes happen to everyone in
real life they're just not documented on
the internet for everyone but it is
crazy seeing how much you change and
grow over the years I started YouTube
when I was sophomore in college so a lot
has happened since then a lot has
changed since then
Kimberly Dewey's says an on makeup
related favorite movie makeup related
favorite drugstore product favorite
maybe I'm not a big movie person at all
I'm more of a show person I also have a
weird memory like I cannot remember
movies for the life of me if I saw one
last week I couldn't tell you what
happens this week that wasn't the
question
favorite movie the island I really like
I really like kind of sci-fi one
favorite drugstore product I think I
would have to say the Physicians Formula
shimmer brick those are just unreal at
the highlight and the eyeshadows they're
beautiful
so there's a lot of questions about what
I do for my job how do I know that's
what I wanted to do let's start with
this one Kylie and he Alyssa that is how
did you get started in digital marketing
or marketing in general so I did not
major in digital marketing in college I
did international relations learning
Arabic it was in the Middle East for
years I've always been really into
marketing I just didn't know looking
back I did a lot of things growing up
said I think I just didn't realize what
I was doing
forced out of youtube I did a bunch of
weird stuff I had like a glitter high
heels business in college where I would
go to thrift store and then make these
glitter heels and sell them had a few
weird things like that I think I
realized when I
Ben Jordan I was kind of looking at just
how they marketed culturally which is
what I studied in college was like
cultural anthropology International
Relations and I just got really into
business and marketing and I decided
Sierra College to do a business minor
and so that's really when I started
taking business classes marketing
classes was my last year in college
which I think happens to a lot of people
you kind of get on this track and then
senior year or junior year you realize
like wait this is actually what I'm more
interested in and that's what happened
to me and my kind of whole philosophy on
that was just because I haven't gotten a
full education and what I want to do
like that's not going to stop me from
doing it so I basically taught myself a
shit-ton my senior year of college I
knew if I wanted to get a job in what I
wanted to do I was going to have to have
some kind of experience pulled out my
hair so I got myself an internship with
this dude
where was he who's in like Kentucky or
something he had this weird online
business and I was like I'll do for
free for you I'll write editorial
content I'll do your social media as I
basically did all that for free just to
put on my resume in college so just
turning into a really long story
I just went in left stargazer powder and
I'm gonna use my cover effects
illuminating setting powder and I think
do I even want to yes this one needs to
be set for sure we use my marquee one so
this what was the actual question so
long story short taught myself a lot
ended up getting a really amazing
internship right out of college I think
I literally applied for over I don't
know 400 internships one just happened
to fall into place and it was the best
thing I could have asked for was in
Seattle it was a startup that just kind
of like took off and the people that
works there or incredible is honestly
just the best experience I could have
asked for so I really learned a lot in
that internship and then I got a
full-time position there afterwards now
looking back I would say if there is
something that you realized you want to
do whether in college or not when people
see that you're determined to do
something and you've taken steps to show
them that I think that speaks so much
more than a degree not saying that you
don't need a degree I definitely
wouldn't have gotten the job I have
without a degree having that on top of
the degrees I think at
speak louder than words you know the
sands Victoria Dominica Dominguez sorry
fencing that on says exactly what do you
do at your job and how did he know
that's what you wanted to do first of
all I didn't know I didn't know what I
wanted to and I took that internship I
didn't know what I was going to be doing
I had never done any of it before and I
just learned a lot and taught myself a
lot I'm going with the country's prime
and fine contour kit and I'm taking this
more for you why for never use it for
contour so we'll see okay what's going
on mark so what is what is not the duty
of your job I probably won't tell you
guys exactly what I do just for privacy
and I just like to keep certain things
off of youtube but basically after that
startup job I had a few other jobs and
without an agency as kind of all over
the place as working to help build a
company after that and then now I've
basically taken what I used to do for
other brands and I built my own
consulting business so that's what I do
now
so I have two different clients so you
guys see obviously me on YouTube it's
been about 30 hours a week on YouTube
and then about 30 hours a week doing
consulting so I still work a lot I work
about 60 hours a week which you did
don't really see any I don't show that
on snapchat or anything this is a good
question so Kristy Beauty says for new
youtubers is it better to have a
management team person or be standalone
what is your opinion on it so I have
lots of thoughtfulness and networks
management everything here's the thing
everything is a business management
companies our business networks our
business they're going to spend their
resources where it pays for them to do
so meaning if you have twenty thousand
subscribers and then they have another
client or youtuber who has five hundred
thousand subscribers
obviously they're going to invest their
time in the person that has five hundred
thousand subscribers because that's
who's going to make them money most
management teams take a commission off
of sponsored posts it'll basically get
you brand deals and take a commission of
it some of them work on like monthly
retainer but most of them just pay
Commission I take the y5 in this wet and
wild color icon blush in mellow wine I
haven't used this blush in forever but I
remember correctly it's super pigmented
so for some reason people have this idea
that they need to be in a network you do
not and should not be in a network I'm
just speaking for myself but I have been
in two different networks had really
horrible experiences nothing came of
them basically the reason why networks
used to exist aren't the same anymore
and the things that they're supposed to
do like it you brand deals and blah blah
they don't do because again resources so
if you are small youtuber get out of the
network they are essentially taking a
cut of your ad revenue and not doing
anything for you in return
brushes are super soft those would they
feel kind of cheap like the handles a
little bit plasticky feeling but they're
super soft I think I'm going with this
rose-gold II kind of highlight this is
blow subtle glowing lights by Lancome
this looks almost exactly like color pot
now if I want to try and use a fan brush
for this know that's working today step
Manders it is yeah not even thinking
about what I'm doing on my face or know
what you're talking as far as management
you usually have to get to a certain
point before managers make sense
management totally depends on the person
if you're someone who doesn't like being
hands-on with brands and you only
understand the business side of things
then the manager could be helpful for
you be be asked how did you stay
motivated to graduate I'm struggling the
stay motivated and not bidding break out
the senior what does they even call it
can you think of it right now
senior slump or something was it called
I've no idea
that's real I would say focusing on the
fact that real life is about to start
was a big motivation for me senior year
I think a lot of people get stuck kind
of slacking off and it really is the
time to excel because when April May
rolls around and everyone is now
scrambling to find a job or an
internship if you start back in January
start looking you're going to be getting
a head start on all those people I guess
I would just say keep your eyes on the
end price this is a good question lelee
HSC says what is your first memory of
May
and I think of Megha back in the day I
really think of like having an orange
face and not being able to find makeup
to match me but when I think back to
like my first first I remember being at
a family friend's house and they had
these mmm remember blue look it called
anger blue they had this makeup kit
thing that was in a CD you like looks
like a CD and I had all these glitter
eyeshadows and those girls were older
than me so I didn't really have makeup
yet and I remember that being like the
first time that I really got to play
around with makeup Shelby Hill says will
you ever do a Seattle meetup pnw school
at barrios yes I will and actually did I
kind of supposed to have meetup at
vloggerfair which was interesting but I
definitely want to do a meet-up in
Seattle KB Tron 3,000 says who are your
favorite non Beauty youtubers I need to
get the sprout going I just did my brows
because there was no it I was going to
happen on camera well talking going to
eyes so my favorite youtubers outside of
Beauty youtubers have a few daily
vloggers that i religiously watch
it's Judy's life I really love Lauren
Bennett
xoxo LC I love her vlog she does like
45-minute weekly vlogs I'm going to
leave everyone I'm talking about channel
down below
Lauren is someone who has such a
different lifestyle than me that I think
it's just so interesting to watch I love
how she doesn't try and be anything else
for vlogs just being very real I think
I'm gonna use that same contour shade
and go in with that on the crease
Danielle Harvey says what is your
typical order at Chipotle whenever you
go I almost always post me Chipotle and
I have my order in there ready to go all
I do is press get it again I just pull
it up for you burrito bowl with pinto
beans white rice cheese guacamole sour
cream Korean chili salsa red chili salsa
and sofrito
besides chips I was little good move on
to some snapchat so Aaron Harper 17 says
I don't have Twitter but my question is
where do you see yourself in five years
that's a good question Aaron I don't
know I've always thought this question
is so interesting because even though
I'm like super organized and planned out
in my daily or like weekly life I don't
want to think in terms of years because
things always happen and they always
just lead to different places and I'm
not
someone to say no when those things
happen so I really don't know I love
Seattle but I also really want to live
in Chicago so I'm not kind of been
thinking about renting like an Airbnb or
something or just renting an apartment
for a few months in Chicago I love
moving I love kind of being
uncomfortable I guess if I'm not
uncomfortable it feels wrong like I feel
like I need to be doing more or trying
different things and I kind of feel like
that right now in Seattle I love it I
love my job my living situation my
friends everything is great I just feel
really comfortable and I just kind of
think about next steps this is the pure
transformation palette this is what it
looks like on the inside does anyone
else hate when they put like cream
products in with powder products it just
drives me crazy like I'm never even
going to use those in my life but the
eyeshadows look really pretty I'm going
to take this brown brick shade right
here these are blending out super easily
kind of torn about what I want to do on
the eyes because there's a super pretty
gold color in here that I kind of want
to use but then I also have to use
pigments that are also by pure cosmetic
another similar question like that how
do you successfully work full-time and
do YouTube what inspires you I think
that's a really good question I need to
figure out what Chad Owens like I want
to do the gold you want to the rose gold
and then put a little bit of gold on do
that oh this is not only shadow what the
heck
liquid shadow that's exciting whoa I'm
kind of just putting this right into the
crease to create kind of a sharp line
okay that is super pretty so how do I do
two jobs what inspires me I just think
if you love doing something and you're
excited about it and you're passionate
about it that is usually enough drive
for you to do something but as far as
actually managing time and getting stuff
done I have a planner I live off of my
planner I plan things out about a week
or two in advance so I know exactly what
I have to do each day I know what I have
to get done in that week so I didn't
plan out where I was spending my time
there's no way that I would be able to
get everything done and what a lot of
that means is making sacrifices in other
aspects of your life every youtuber most
of them some of them got lucky but most
of them put in the hours and made
sacrifices
get where they are right now it didn't
just magically fall in their laps
Delaney Burke says do you have any tips
for chronic migraine sufferers I get
them every day and it's the words hope
you're doing well I hope you are doing
well as well as well as well hold on
what am i doing on my eyes I want to put
some purple from this paladin I
mentioned this in the last Q&amp;amp;A I did I
think but focus on the good days if you
have any kind of chronic pain you know
that the good days are kind of hard to
come by so when you feel good and you
are having a good day go out and do
something fun and take advantage of it
because you really never know how you're
going to feel the next day or in a few
hours even so I don't know I just always
try and think that it gives me different
perspective on life but a lot of people
don't have if you don't suffer from any
kind of chronic pain that's worth tips
for actually dealing with it I would
also say find someone who gets it I'm
lucky that my best friend not lucky but
her mom also suffers from migraines so
I've been really lucky that my best
friend understands it and gets it and
she's always there for me when I feel
like or have to go the ER whatever
it is so if you can I would say find
someone in your life who can be
empathetic because nothing is worse than
when people tell you to take Advil or
drink water or just don't get it at all
gray says what is your current favorite
face mask ooh that is hard if you guys
follow me on snapchat which is just the
tailless Maps I will show you guys what
face mask I'm wearing I'm a face mask
addict I think I have like I don't know
probably over 50 face mess I love face
masks they're super relaxing for me at
the end of the night I wear one almost
every night just because it relaxes me
it's kind of like my wine down regime
favorite one by the way this is the Y 18
for some reason I'm blanking on like
every face mask so they use right now I
would say as a L'Oreal black mask I'm
not sure exactly what's called it when
their new face mask is the black one it
is amazing I feel like it's helped my
skin a lot I also still love and use the
clay why am i blinking and all the names
the African clay mask only get down
blows from Amazon it's like under 10
bucks it gets a huge jar and I just mix
it with apples
vinegar on this y22 brush I'm going to
take that same brick shade from the
palette and put that on the lower lash
line
Cassandra dumped Dominica's time to
answer this no I think she has some
other questions she said would you like
to go back and visit Israel so as there
you don't know I think this was another
question I lived in Jordan for a year
and then I lived in Tel Aviv for summer
after that and I also lived in Jerusalem
during high school so yes I definitely
plan on going back to Israel and
actually planning a trip right now to go
back to Jordan to stay with my host
family for a couple weeks I am super
excited I miss them I had the best host
family could have ever asked for
whoa that was super pigmented but Israel
is the bordering country of Jordan so if
I go to Jordan we'll definitely go back
to Israel I'm going to go back in with
my Catrice contour and blend that out a
little bit so for liquid eyeliner I
think I'm actually going to try out this
new will new to me this is the bomb
Schwing black eyeliner okay this is a
little tricky to get like a smooth line
it's one of those eyeliners okay this is
turning into a disaster
I can already tell somebody wants my wet
and wild eyeliner and not a fan of that
eyeliner what and while coming to the
rescue
Mele says are you going to stay this
color gray or go more gray I love your
hair any color love you too I kind of
friend
so for mascara I'm going to try this
Maybelline falsies push-up angel I
haven't tried this yet I love the
original falsies mascara I'm going to
put on false lashes today but I kinda
want to see how this works on me I'm
kind of in a hair predicament right now
because my hair basically isn't healthy
enough yet to go silver which has always
been the end goal so I think I'm going
to be gray for a couple more months so
I'm actually going in on 15th to get
fusions I think they're called for I tap
one of those oh no kind of extensions
are they like attached to the strand of
your hair just because I can't keep up
with these myself and I think we're
going to do like a dark - gray - silver
with the extensions hopefully that's the
plan we'll see
sauce launches the thing I'm going to
use my social eyes
Masha's all of my makeup from my door
right now is packed up in bags and boxes
because I haven't told you guys this yet
I'm actually moving into a office space
which is very exciting and no longer
going to be working as my room so I'm
going to be doing YouTube stuff there
and also consulting stuff so the
background in the next couple weeks will
be changing
I'm going to be showing everything on
snapchat I might even be blogging the
move so that's super exciting I never
thought that would happen actually being
able to get out of my room let me know
down below if you want to see an office
tour once I have everything moved in but
I got a ton of new furniture along the
lines of exciting things while we're at
it this picture I posted on Twitter a
while ago like a couple months ago when
I was in New York and you guys the time
is come in the announcement is going to
be coming out I think a week after this
video goes up so make sure you're
following me on all my social channels
I'm going to show you some sneak peeks
very excited for that and I hope you
guys are too so this is going to be a
really long video if you have stuck
around to this point you're listening
right now down below comment pineapple
sometimes when I put on false lashes I
all of a sudden feel like I can't think
straight doesn't anyone else
they're like blinders or something we're
going to use that same mascara to blend
the falsies a little bit and I think I'm
also going to use it on my bottom lashes
just because it does have a tiny one
let's see how it works on the bottom
this person took a photo so I can't
actually see what her snapchat name is
but she says have you ever been to
Arizona I have been to Arizona I've been
to Sedona a while ago we took like a
family trip to Sedona I was in high
school I think alright I think we're
done with eyes let's do lips and then
we're going to wrap this thing up for
lips I think I might try this this would
be road I know this road Isle or wrote
wrote yeah Matthew wrote I'll swathe
lips this in the shade big apple I've
used one of their new shades of muse and
it was pretty nice kind of smells like
cherry crayon that's so super pretty
like wine kind of color alright so this
is the final look if you guys liked this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
so I know let me know down below if you
guys like this Q&amp;amp;A style try
schmooze I usually just ramble about
whatever if I don't do a Q&amp;amp;A but it's
kind of nice for me having you know a
direction to go everything I use will be
listed down below in the description box
