excited about life alright feel like I
haven't done the shadow and schmooze in
a hot minute if you're new to the Buried
a family shadow moves or where we put
makeup on our face talk about the
products talk about life so this is a
full face get ready with me video using
a new foundation combo trying out the
new morphe elite 2 collection brushes
that just came out these julep boxes
which you can get at Ulta this is the
get glowing illuminating kit and then I
also have the lam it up kit right here
each of these boxes comes with four
products so basically for 40 bucks
you're getting each product for $10
which is drugstore prices these retail
for $39 at Ulta and starting in August
julep is actually available in 250 Ulta
stores across the country and online
which rocks because previously I think
you'd only get julep on their website
actually have 57 products coming to Ulta
so it's awesome that they're gonna be
available to more people now and Ulta
stores you can actually put the products
before you buy them see which ones
you're feeling so thank you to Jolla for
collaborating with me on this video if
you want to try out julep belt I do have
a 20% off length and I'll link in the
description box down below let's get
into the video
it is 11:20 a.m. have not eaten avocado
toast yet had an avocado emergency this
morning out of avocados I feel like my
day just isn't right without avocados
alright I just got a new mic really just
ran downstairs and got this all set up I
hope the sound quality sounds better let
me know down below what you guys think
of it but I played it back on just my
camera I haven't listened to it on the
computer yet and it sounded pretty damn
good but you couldn't hear like every
little crinkle so I have a giant basket
box whatever this is of products I want
to use today so on the face today I
think I want to mix the Urban Decay
Naked skin weightless foundation with
the Leo le BB cream I haven't tried this
combo yet the Leo le is a tiny bit dark
and it's super creamy I love this BB
cream has really great coverage and this
one is a little more on the liquidy side
so I'm gonna go ahead and make my
foundation cocktail over here and I did
do a whole review of The Naked Skin
Foundation during 15
foundation I think this is gonna be a
pretty long video because I feel like I
haven't talked to you guys in forever
and I also just happened like been a
part of the world for the last two days
so I throw a pretty bad migraine streak
but yesterday was rough so it feels good
to be functioning today and talking to
you guys this really does make you feel
grateful for the healthy dates that you
have if you have any kind of chronic
pain you know what I'm talking about so
I do have the brand new morphe elite
collection here that I'm gonna try and
use all these today not all these but
all the brushes I used today are gonna
be from the morphe elite 2 collection
I've only tried this foundation brush so
far this is the e30 one and it feels a
little bit different than the original
one they definitely are softer but in a
different way like they just feel a
little bit flimsy to me it is blending
this out beautifully but personally for
a foundation brush for me I like it a
little bit more stiff just so I get
better coverage basically what happened
with that I believe was that morphe
wasn't intending the elite collection to
be permanent it's supposed to be just
like a limited edition thing at first
and it was selling so well they kind of
just kept it though the new elite 2
collection is supposed to be like the
permanent version of that now that I
have the permanent brows on I try and be
kind of careful going around them with
foundation cuz it's super easy to cover
them up so far like in that combo I'm
gonna go back and add a second layer
just thoughts that we need just a little
bit more coverage looking really nice
and dewy I have an insta karte order
coming right now with avocados because
it's an emergency
insta garden post meets literally saved
my life in scars grocery delivery and
post meets its food delivery if you
follow me on snapchat you see my post
minutes addiction I actually really like
the way this combo looks so far I have
some more product but I don't really
feel like there's any spots that we
really need it so I'm just going to
blend down my neck a little bit yeah
that combo is sitting really nicely on
my skin and this brush was totally fine
I don't like it as much as the original
one but it worked
I tried a bunch of new concealers during
15 days foundation but I'm still loving
my collection cosmetics lasting
perfection concealer this is not a u.s.
brand so if you're in the u.s. you
tore this off of the eBay but I just
frickin love it I feel like this is so
underrated
I know that there are a lot of new
people in my channel from 15 News
Foundation so let me know what videos
you guys want to see I might do like an
all up holy grail product video I feel
like if you've been watching me for a
while you know what my Holy Grail
products are but if not it's kind of
hard to go back and watch like 5000
videos and figure that out so let me
know if you guys don't see that what
brush are we gonna try for this let's
try this guy this is the e 20 that just
shed yeah that just shed
it did blend out the concealer really
nicely though the only non-elite to
brush i'm gonna use is this guy because
i literally can't use a different brush
to apply my under eye setting powder
this is an elf brush I'll link it down
below with the stargazer powder Holy
Grail this is what I used to set my
under eyes every single day something
about this brush with this powder it
just is perfection I have weird under
eye concealer issues I can't bake it
just looks so funky on me this just sets
my under eyes perfectly without taking
away and you have the coverage of the
concealer look at that side compared to
that side I'm gonna set my face today I
think yeah I usually set my face with
the Leo Ellie just because it's not
super long-lasting if you don't I
finally ordered the Kat Von D locket
powder foundation in the shade L 42 this
is super light I think this might be too
light for me when I wear foundation
that's too dark sometimes I can lighten
it and make it look normal with a
lighter powder so I might keep it for
that reason but it looks pretty dang
light to the l42
range is like super pale it might be too
light but let's just go in this is the e
41 I mentioned this on snapchat but this
one compared to the old e 41 it feels
nice and soft but it's just a lot more
flimsy it's not as like densely packed
and I can see bristles like flying now
as I'm doing this yeah there's like
bristles coming up I don't know guys I
don't know I usually like it more dense
brush to put on powder I think I want to
switch let's try this one's a little bit
more dense this is the e
one oh yeah like that one alright it's
actually not looking to lay this on the
face that powder is definitely more on
the matte side totally mattified my face
pretty much how does this happen I have
a cup right here sitting with all my
brushes and I still end up everywhere
except the cup I've gotten a lot of
questions lately about what my favorite
contour is for pale skin this has been
my favorite for a couple years now and
it still is this is the it cosmetics my
sculpted face palette this is the
original one they did reformulate this
and like repackage it so I haven't tried
the new one I still have a ton of
product left in this shade right here
which is the one I use I'm going to take
the e4 brush and go ahead and contour a
little bit
I think these ones just feel a little
bit cheaper to me which I'm assuming is
what they did and all these are shedding
just an FYI which kind of sucks because
I feel like the elite collection from
Worf II was the ones that I really liked
they just felt like a little bit higher
quality you don't feel as soft on the
face either like they definitely feel
tiny bit scratchy on the face actually
which is weird because when you just
feel them with your hands they don't and
I am a morphe affiliate like I've told
you guys before so there are certain
products that I recommend from them
there are certain brushes that I don't
so I will tell you straight up if a
brush is worth it and if it's not all
right I just love that contour like look
at that ladies look at that so favorite
blush hands-down this month has been the
wet and wild color icon hombre blush in
the shade purple in a purple haze this
is just stunning I'm going to use the e3
does have a little bit of a glow to it
just love the way it blends oh okay I do
like this brush this one felt nice and
soft I did an Instagram post and I
talked about this on snapchat about my
favorite current highlighters essence
eyeshadow and snowflake if you have pale
skin go drive to Ulta right now and pick
this up it is frickin stunning as a
highlight watch this in store and
formula of it just felt like it would be
a perfect face highlight it is super
soft super buttery doesn't have any kind
of glitter chunkiness to it it's two
dollars or even less than that might be
a dollar looks almost identical to becca
lawnmower really i think i'm going to
use the e 49 they do have a fan brush in
here but i don't know I don't usually
like brushes that much oh my god look at
that so stunning this formula which is
an eye shadow is seriously better than
80% of the high end highlighters I have
really hope you guys can't here's a long
room right now so beautiful and I do
like this brush I'm putting a bit down
my nose whatever is left over and I
might keep his bow why is it called a
Cupid's bow does anyone know I guess I
could Google that oh my god this high
just makes me excited about life you
know you're obsessed with makeup when
you're excited to wake up in the morning
to put highlighter on your face it is so
nice that I don't have to touch my brows
at all anymore I'm use the makeup from
Hermiston fix if you have an event that
you need your makeup to look good all
day long this setting spray is really
nice as an everyday setting spray I
think I like the hard candy or the
L'Oreal one right so now that we have
the base on I have these two boxes from
julep one of them is to glam it up
cocktail ready box one is illuminating
look the illuminating one has a lot of
cream products has a name blush in a
cream highlight which don't usually sit
too well on my skin boo but it has a
full coverage lip crayon that looks
really promising I think I'm gonna go in
with this box first and use some stuff
in here get a little product card when
you open it that shows how you can wear
some of them and then here's house
packaged I think it looks really nice
and sleek with the black on black
stead of priming my eyes I'm gonna use
this eye shadow one cream to powder
eyeshadow stick is in the shade orchid
shimmer and these are supposed to be
waterproof long-lasting increase proof
so let's apply this all over the lid
where am I gonna miss I don't really
know so I'm just gonna blend this out
with my finger I just pulled a bunch of
random eyeshadows for this look so I
don't really know what we're doing I
just know I want to put purple on my I
think I'm gonna go in with some of my
makeup geek shadows so I'm gonna go in
with the e27 and take Peach Smoothie
which is basically like a peach tone
transition shade and I'm just blending
that feel like my mirror is like way too
far right now there we go I can see my
eyeballs to cherry cola let's start by
blending this really well into the like
a burr ve area not bringing this too
high up into that Peach Smoothie shade
this brush is the e17 it's like a small
blending brush feels so good to like be
alive and functioning right now I can't
even tell you all I'm thinking about is
avocado toast
oh speaking of avocado my avocado clutch
came in the mail can tell this is the
proudest moment in my life or the most
regretful but I bought the Betsey
Johnson why did I do this it's the $80
on an avocado if you follow me on
Facebook you saw this whole dilemma
Betsey Johnson has a taco clutch and an
avocado clutch
basically the biggest decision of my
life alright so whatever is left over on
that brush I'm just dragging a little
bit inwards there's barely any product
on the brush when I'm doing this okay so
kind of want the purple to be like BAM
purple not just like chillin purple
Caitlin rose and this is like a super
shimmery BAM
80s purple oh my God look at that heck
yeah
look at that purple eyeshadows never
fully show up under these lights like
they do in real life
and I'm gonna take an even smaller
blending brush this is the e 18 and I'm
gonna go in with this wet-and-wild
shadow I don't have any makeup geek like
dark purple shades so I'm gonna go in
with what this shade right here from Wet
n Wild this has a little bit of sparkle
in it but I think once we blend it out
it'll be fine and I'm just gonna put
this in the very outer portion of my eye
if you just want a softer purple eye you
could definitely skip that step but I'm
like feeling the smoke today I'm going
to take the julep liner when pencil
meets gel in smokey plum this is like a
dark purple eyeliner so it's a
waterproof formula that's supposed to
set in 30 seconds and it lasts for 10
plus hours it's gonna pop this on the
waterline so we are gonna be blending
shadow on the bottom lash line like I
usually do so I'm just gonna bring this
a tiny bit below the waterline whenever
I do waterline eyeliner I typically
don't like to bring it all the way in
because it can kind of close off your
eyes first then we go back in with
Motown and I'm using the e 43 I'm just
placing this directly on the eyeliner
I'm gonna go in with desert sands by
makeup geek which is this like
brown shade right here one of my
favorites using the Sedona lace 9:04
brush this one I am bringing in farther
because I want it to look super smoked
out but not too dark and you want to be
blending this like I'm no longer on my
eye if that makes sense like I'm
bringing this pretty low because that's
what's gonna make your eyes look bigger
than what they actually are now I'm
going back in with that dark purple
shade from Wet n Wild debating whether
one do liquid eyeliner it just falsies
kind of just one
falsies first I'm gonna do something
with a lighter shade of purple this is
the old e19 brush I don't see anyone
taking the shade daydreamer by makeup
geek and this is on their foiled
eyeshadows this is a lighter purple oh
 I'm just gonna put that right on
the center of the eye oh my God look at
that shadow if you put a lighter shade
right in the center it'll just help
create some dimension alright I think
I'm officially in love with that shade
oh it just got an interesting text okay
anyways so I think I'm gonna take this
super shimmery shade by makeup geek
voltage which I've been obsessed with
for putting on the inner corner so I
think I've decided on skipping out on
eyeliner Oh things are work out getting
out of the box my reply thin coat of
mascara before I put on falsies this is
the drill up length matters mascara and
that we use this before it has to be
smacks formula that's interesting for
smooth clump rebuilding the layering the
brush of this kinda reminds me of the
wet and wild make a length mascara that
I use on my bottom lashes it has super
tiny bristles and it looks like they're
like rubbery I typically don't go for
lengthening mascaras on the top I
usually like more like volume but this
is looking really nice and like
separated the falsies I'm going to be
using today are the clean color angelic
wink number 48 these are stunning this
is what I wore in the vibrating sponge
foundation video I love these lashes I
feel like these are gonna be my new
favorites and I'm pretty sure these are
like two dollars or less my instacart
literally just got here I was like last
minute trying to put on false lashes and
that happened love in life
alright so folks is are on I use the Wet
n Wild make length mascara was having
major false lash issues today not even
sure if these are actually on my
eyeballs right now so for lips I'm gonna
go in with either one of these I've
talked about these before my channel I
think I have a couple of shadow and
schmooze is using these but this is the
julep lip mousse in the shade ooh la la
this shade has been sold out on julep
for forever so if you can get your hands
on this
alta oren stores do it because this is
like one of my favorite liquid lipstick
formulas and shades these are you see
they don't feel drying at all but they
do dry down there pretty long-lasting
this one I've never tried that this is
the it's bomb lip crayon the shade
almond nude cream and it's supposed to
be like a full coverage lip product and
it has this little white thing in the
middle of them assuming it's like a
moisturizing foam or something I kind of
want to see let's see what color it says
feel like that might be a little bit too
peach for this look so I think I'm gonna
go in with a la la
I just want to show you guys the
applicator of these are also super
interesting I should like to use the end
of it to kind of line my lips and then
go in and fill it in the shape of these
like weirdly hugs your lips it feels
really good I like can't even see my
lips right now so that is la la it's
super pretty kind of dusty mauve shade I
think I'm gonna take this essence xxx ll
shine lip gloss and just put a little
bit of this on the center of my lips
this isn't the shade glamour to go this
smells like great medicine alright so
this is the final look I need to go
unpack groceries make some avocado toast
I'm stoked like always I'm gonna link
everything down below if you guys like

schmooze videos give it a thumbs up so I
