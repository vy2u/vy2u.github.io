my beauty blender and then accidentally
drink it awesome
all right so it is Saturday just chillin
Sports Bra sometimes I feel like if I
put the sports bra on then I'll work out
you never really know I just did my
makeup obviously still working on the
hair on my face today I mixed something
that I've never mixed before and I
haven't worn in like years I probably
shouldn't put this on my face but this
is the leo le BB cream mixed in with my
favorite Manic Panic dreamtone to
lighten it up because it is pretty dark
and I freaking love it I don't know if
you guys can tell but it gives such good
coverage this does not seem like a BB
cream to me it's pretty much like a full
coverage foundation and it gives you a
super nice dewy ish finish and I'm just
loving it what are you doing here to
highlight it also use the Mac mineralize
skinfinish and soft and gentle which I
haven't used in again like years I
actually just ordered the lightscapade
shade off of glambot it was like $10 off
I think I literally buy makeup on there
every other day they just have insane
sales I think I'm going to be doing a
shadow in shmooze slash hall with some
of the products I ordered from there I
don't know if that'll be up before this
it might I'll link it over here if it is
I think today I'm gonna go to Old Navy
because they're having like a 40% off
activewear haul and I've actually been
kind of working out lately I know weird
I've been doing Jillian Michaels like
every night and I just feel really good
feels good to work out sometimes sing
I'm gonna try and find some more workout
clothes because I literally happy wears
pants because I work out like twice a
year bring you guys along this is my new
baby
I ordered the Sony and x5t and I've
heard really good things about this I'm
basically completely fed up with my
Canon t5i I'm gonna be selling it it's
just I don't think it's the right camera
for me I want something that completely
autofocuses this one is super
lightweight it has a DSLR lens which is
really awesome you can switch out the
lenses you can also get different
adapters for it I'll link this camera
down below if you want to check it out
but I got it off of Amazon and it was
really reasonable it's around 350 I
wanted to try this one out and I'm
hoping that I like it better I know the
t5i a lot of people love it I think my
issue is my lens and I'm just not at a
point where I want to invest $600 and
then
tim luns I just don't want to deal with
the mic and buying a new lens and
everything I just want a simple camera
that's good quality that can focus on
something when I hold it up to the
frickin lens this is exciting we're
ready to roll on the lips I mix the elf
matte lip color in natural with color
pop skimpy this is a glossy one this
one's obviously mad if you have dry lips
you'll probably love these colors pop
ones it makes your lips look so smooth
and glossy why is this so hard to get
not wearing anything super exciting
story of my life but my necklace is from
rocksbox and it just says shine on it
should I show you what I have in my
rocks box right now I mentioned rocks
box a while back I think I did an
unboxing video I still use it and it's
honestly one of my favorite boxes I
think I have a code where you can get
your first box either half off or free I
think it might be half off I'll link it
down below I think it's just taylor XOXO
send you 3 pieces you can exchange as
many as you want per month this is the
first necklace i got actually wear this
the other day which is like a grey shirt
it looks really cool just super neon
it's not even showing up on camera and
then I have this bangle which I also
really like and it's actually small
enough for my wrists you can bend it the
third one in the Box this month I wasn't
super huge fan up and I'm gonna take it
out sailing one hand but it's like this
long and gold and it has these little
like black gems it's just not really my
style I'm not gonna show you is because
it has my address on it but they
basically give you a pre-paid return
label so you literally just pop it on
there put all your jewelry in the arms
low and you send it back you change it
however many times you want for month
alright so it's been about four hours
and those a little unexpected complaint
shopping trip actually got a ton of
stuff so I'll probably show you guys
like a mini haul when I get home I got
wet tools and it's bomb it is freaking
hot out right now so I'm just chilling
in my car with the a/c on eating my
pretzel definitely just spilt half the
bag all over the backseat of my car
fun times I really like the way this
foundation looks I don't know why the
car lighting always makes your face look
like Ken shades darker than your neck
all the dressing room Lighting's and
stuff it looks really nice the finish
was just
perfect why is it shaking right now the
car is not even moving Seattle traffic
I'm back I think I'm gonna clean my car
we don't even want to know how long it's
been since I clean my car we got a
vacuum I think we're gonna do this all
right this is a super uneventful vlog
literally just been cleaning my car
cleaning the house cleaning the kitchen
but now I'm gonna edit and paint my
nails I think I'm gonna use SES Borrowed
and blue I went to bartels to pick up a
prescription and while I was there I got
the 3d gel shine topcoat whatever this
is called by Sally Hansen Nicole Ferraro
made me do it I'm gonna try this with
the CHEO Tay whatever top coat because
this is super fast drying and Nicole
said that that one just won't dry so you
have to put a fast drying one over it
it's gonna try these two together I
actually really like this top coat it
makes your nails super shiny I'm gonna
show you guys a quick qahal I'm not
gonna actually film the whole hall for
this I'm so I guess we'll just show you
right now an exciting workout clothes
neon green sports bra from Nordstrom
Rack going to this like event thing for
my friend's birthday next weekend so I
ended up getting a dress to wear
high-neck thing and then it's latches at
the waist really exciting socks these
are actually the kids ones because I
feel like they fit me better I just got
three packs of Puma socks then I got
this DKNY their Apple perfume a
rollerball I have their normal one and
you can tell it's like almost out this
is definitely like my going-out perfume
so about the rollerball to put my purse
so Old Navy was 40% off all of their
workout clothes and they also had a $15
off $50 purchase which I use a pre yoga
pants had they're kind of thing going on
I like it because they have the thick
band and they're super comfy and these
were her seat you think these were 1260
they had a couple different colors of
this shirt that got all of them shopping
addict I like this because it is super
flowy I hate working out on tops that
are like suit
tight against your stomach like you
could just wear with yoga's while you're
like chillin - I got two of these I also
got the mint green and gray one I got
this top which you could also wear it
just like chillin with sweats it looks
kind of ugly on just like looking at it
but it actually fits really cute I
really like this one because it was
short sleeve I just want something that
covers like your back or arms or
whatever while you're working out this
was super soft to the rest of the stuff
isn't working out it's just like random
stuff I got maybe I was really great
basic camis and stuff and I really liked
because they're kind of the ones that
like stuck everything in wanted to get
new camis for wearing underneath things
so got a white and a black one and both
of these were on sale for eight dollars
I believe 695 I should have got more of
these dang it then I got a black shirt
surprise surprise a high-neck top has
like a slit back so I just thought that
would be cute with like jeans and
booties or something the last thing I
bought which I totally didn't need are
these like lounge pants I just thought
they were really cute they're black and
white striped and they have like the
cinched ankle which I need because I'm
short so if not I'm like walking on my
pants so I don't even know if this vlog
is like long enough to put up but I'm
really not doing anything else exciting
tonight I'm gonna take off my makeup
workout cook dinner and edit I think
we're gonna call it a wrap oh I
have to get my leopard rug this is gonna
be an issue in it like legit gets hot
