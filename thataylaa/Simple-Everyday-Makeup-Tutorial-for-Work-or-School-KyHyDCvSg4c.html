face alright so today we have a work
appropriate makeup tutorial my office is
actually super chill I could probably
wear blue lipstick and no one would look
twice if you just got out of college and
you're just starting your first job or
you could also wear this lift to school
I hope this video is helpful for you
guys I pretty much wear some variation
of this makeup every single day to work
I switch up the lips almost every single
day
sometimes I'll wear like a muted red lip
but I usually go for this kind of nudie
situation a lot of the products I use
today are from my Ulta haul I'll link
that down below but that was my last
video that went up if you guys want to
see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching alright
we are going to clip back the hairs my
skin is breaking out right now I have no
idea why I haven't changed anything I
just start using the Clarisonic last
night and I swear to God I woke up and
this it was like gone I don't know I
really like it so far my skin just feels
so nice this morning I've already primed
the face I use the body shop tea tree
primer like always and I'm gonna start
out with the tatcha do a skin luminous
dewy skin mist and this is just the
travel size I wanted to try out the
travel before I spent like $40 on a
setting spray
I actually prefer applying this
underneath my makeup the foundation I'm
going to use is pretty matte and this
actually like shows through the
foundation which is awesome I tried my
NYX dewy skin setting spray yesterday to
kind of compare the two and this one
definitely does a better job underneath
foundation
I feel like NYX does a better job on top
though you can see the skin is looking
super duty right now oh no I've dropped
this like 10 times so for a foundation
I've been using the Lancome tint Idol no
idea how to say that ultra 24 hour
makeup someone tagged me in an Instagram
photo of this they just came out with
this shade it's in the shade 90 ivory
and this is actually light enough for my
skin tone it's a tiny bit too cool toned
I feel like for my skin but it totally
works and it lasts literally all day
long the finish by itself is way too
matte for my liking so I did use a damp
makeup sponge what are you doing to
apply it so it gives a little bit more
do and then with Tasha underneath it's
like perfection so I just go in and dip
a little style and
I don't think this foundation is
completely full coverage you can
definitely see some scarring and stuff
through I usually do a couple layers and
I get it to like an almost full coverage
I should try mixing in the cover FX
drops with this actually I really like
this foundation for work because it
doesn't look super heavy on my skin I
don't powder it I love that it has a
pump hell yeah I'm just going over that
first layer and I just like to do this
on spots that I have acne scarring
showing through or anything we want to
cover up when you go over with the
second layer doesn't want cakey at all
it's it's super nice on the skin one
down that neck ladies so as you can see
you can still see my skin underneath
which I actually don't mind for work I
am gonna use concealer to cover up the
under eyes I'm using my Urban Decay
Naked skin which I'm almost completely
out of so we'll see how this goes hands
down best concealer ever I'm just
applying this in a v-shape under my eyes
to brighten everything up and any acne
scarring I'm gonna take the needle and
air that what is this
Real Techniques sponge and just pumps it
out I like to use my finger to blend out
the concealer usually like it gives
better coverage so the under eye like
always additions formula powder
correcting powder if you like your
t-zone more matte looking you can also
use whatever is left over on the brush
and just pounce it a little bit on the
forehead actually like it kind of duty
so I'm not gonna do that much this
foundation isn't super fast drying like
it's still pretty tacky so I go on to
brows next I have a full brow routine
that I'll link down below if you haven't
seen a hit but for brows for work I like
to keep it a little more simple I don't
carve them out at all and I just kind of
use a lighter hand so I'm gonna go in
with my Ulta brow tint brow gel in the
shade deep Holy Grail brow gel this
stuff is amazing if you like your brow
shape you could totally just use this I
like to bring my brows out a little bit
farther so I'm gonna go in with my
dipper afterwards brows are one of those
things that you probably want to keep a
little bit more natural for work I'm
gonna take my dip brow pomade and Shay
granite I usually use the brown shades
but I've been going in with this lately
and I kind of like it that's just weird
like x-shape going on what is happening
so I basically just fill in the tail end
of my brow with this my mirror feels
like it's my hallway right now I'm just
adding a tiny bit of shape to the top
and that is basically all idea for brows
for work I always have a harder time
with the shape on this side so sometimes
I have to go in with concealer you can
see it's a little big on the end there
honestly a lot of times for work I don't
care because people aren't looking at my
brows I'm just gonna use whatever's left
over to do kind of like an upward motion
at the front of the brow to be
completely honest I'll probably leave
that brow for work I just don't have
time in the morning so that's what we're
gonna do today
Cheers next we're gonna add just a tiny
bit of contour this is obviously an
optional step you don't have to contour
at 6:00 in the morning for work I like
it just as I feel like it gives me a
little bit more definition on my face
I'm going to try out this Ulta contour
kit for the first time I mention this in
my most recent haul actually a few of
these products are gonna be from that
whole thing I'm gonna go in with this
shade warmth bronzer some one looks like
it's more of a bronzer not a contour I'm
gonna take this big tapered brush and
we're just gonna see what happens I'm
just kind of dusting this not really
contouring bringing this a tiny bit on
my temples just warm up the face I think
we're gonna try out that same highlight
in the palette I'm going to try this
luster highlight which is like the light
yellow gold it doesn't look very pretty
in the pan at all it looks pretty flat I
just watch it on my hand and I'd be good
who knows we'll find out so we're just
gonna put this right on the top of the
cheekbone I always do a highlight for
work especially like a more natural one
whoa
that's actually really pretty I feel
like that actually gives a really nice
like Sheen probably don't want to be put
in like champagne pop on your cheekbones
for work I feel like something like this
is fine I'm gonna try out this makeup
revolution sugar and spice ultra blush
palette looks like there's some super
nice shades in here and look at those I
want to put those like all over my face
I think we're gonna go in with this one
this looks most work-appropriate
so I'm just placing this mostly on the
apples of my cheek bronzer and
highlighter optional but I
definitely apply some kind of blush on
to your face okay moving on to eyes I
usually go super simple for my eyes at
work almost every single day I go in
with the Too Faced chocolate bar palette
the shade salted caramel is perfect for
the crease just gives your eyes some
definition in shape but it doesn't
really look like you're wearing a ton of
eyeshadow favorite brush for that is the
it cosmetics like duo brush on you know
what this is called it doesn't really
have a yet does its complexion brush
number seven I usually don't put on a
primer because in the morning I honestly
can't be bothered we up concealer on our
eyelid right now so it's it's all good
don't worry blending this into the
crease I think I had some peanut butter
left on there because this looks a
little darker than it usually does so
I'm just putting this directly in the
crease I'm not blending too far out or
too far in
well most product to be right on the
outer third and then whatever's left
over blend inwards I usually keep my
lips completely bare because like I said
we have concealer on there so nothing's
showing through if you wanted to you
could apply white chocolate on the lid
for the inner corner I'm going to go
back in with that same highlight shade
we used on the face this is just a quick
and easy tip for the morning when you
don't want to be using like five
thousand different products just use the
same highlight that you put on your face
these highlights also look a little bit
more natural than like shimmery light
shades pop a tiny bit on the Cupid's bow
maybe a little bit on the nose you never
know this look is all about the mascara
if you don't have to face better than
sex mascara in your life you need it
feel like this is one of the only
mascaras that I feel comfortable not
wearing eyeliner with makes your lashes
look frickin amazing so when I apply
this I just look down this is one of
those mascaras so that less can be more
so you should try and get a good first
coat
when it starts to look clumpy that's
when you want to stop so that's
literally all I do you can see the
difference it just look a lot more awake
on this side you only need one coat of
this stuff which is great for the
morning it does take a little bit to dry
so make sure you don't like look at the
ceiling right away I always put a little
coat of Wet n Wild mega length on the
bottom lashes well the eyes are drying
I'm just gonna take a baby wipe and I
just like to wipe off the foundation for
my lips alright so for lips you want to
have like a little bit of color but not
anything super intense sometimes I wear
a red lipstick to work but that's just
because I can't at the office I work in
but I'm assuming most people can't these
options are for you everybody just die I
don't remember what we were talking
about but I think we're talking about
lips type two lip liners that are like
my go-to liners for work the first is
essence in the nude in the second is
color pop skimpy both of these are super
nice nude lip liners that you can wear
with pretty much anything we're gonna go
in with skimpy today by color pop I'm
going to be completely filling them in
today with this lip liner next we're
gonna go in with this ulm a gloss this
is in the shade 800 rosy lift I just
picked this up because they had like a
40% off all May sale I don't think I've
ever bought anything from all made in my
life but I actually really like this and
it smells like cake
and I'm just gonna apply this all over
alright so this is the final look this
is pretty much what I do every single
day for work lips are the only thing
that I switch up every day other good
lip options are color pops ultra matte
lip in the shade midi this is like a
perfect wearable kind of nude I also
really like Pacifica what is this
devotion deeply devoted natural lipstick
this isn't shade natural natural mystic
that's a lot of natural in one name this
is just a super nice kind of natural
berry color if you don't put too much of
this on it can look like the like just
ate a lollipop kind of red lip
it does have a super strong coconut
smell so if you're not about that you
won't like this let me know down below
