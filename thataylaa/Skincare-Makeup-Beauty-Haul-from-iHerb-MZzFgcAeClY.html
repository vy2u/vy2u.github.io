background right now get it together
Taylor where are you got the silver hair
today black lipstick just ordered taco
time
life is good here in my face alright so
today we have another haul video I think
I've finished it then a haul videos the
last couple weeks but a lot of them were
pre-recorded so it's just like the
typing that I was uploading them though
super excited to go through this package
weird a bunch of stuff from iHerb calm
is it a herb or I herb I say herb but I
herbs sounds weird I feel like I don't
know where the heck I've been my whole
life because I heard had some like super
different brands I've never heard of the
same time they carry like Physicians
Formula elf tons of stuff and the thing
I like is that they have a kick-ass
reward program which I'll get into as we
like go through some of the stuff but if
you're debating between buying some
these brands on I her but versus from
like the drugstore or from Amazon or
whatever so initially check out I heard
because basically get 10% and back to
spin on your next purchase every single
time you shop in there so I have a like
$12 in credit to use next time on top of
the 10% of rewards you can also get $5
off your first order I'll leave the link
in the description box down below where
that will give you $5 off and you also
get free shipping over $20 which is
frickin awesome and they don't charge
sales tax on anything like this is like
all of my online shopping prayers
answered super excited about some of the
stuff I got I haven't seen a lot of it
before or like heard of other brands
before so let's get into it okay so the
first thing I got is this Dickinson's
witch hazel I've heard so many you guys
telling me to try this out witch hazel
is supposed to be a really good toner if
you have acne my acne just give you a
quick update I did just start
spironolactone as of like a few days ago
so I won't be seeing any difference for
a couple months but hopefully it helps
I'm gonna be trying this out also my
topper time dude is coming in like 20
minutes so we're gonna have to do this
fast stain on the acne thing I got some
derma e very clear acne spot treatment
I've never heard of this but it has 2%
salicylic acid plus tea tree so I feel
like that's a good
combo basically just a spot treatment so
I'm going to try this out very spot
treatment right now is the Mario Badescu
drying lotion that stuff seriously will
dry the heck out of your zit it got a
ton of elf makeup it's actually pretty
sweet because if there's something sold
out on the elf store that you've been
trying to get your hands on look on I
heard because it might be in stock there
this is the moisturizing foundation
stick in the shade I agree and this is
the lightest shade typically elf
foundations are pretty freakin dark eye
shadow self tan on right out for the
first time in forever so I might try out
this foundation well I'm a little bit
darker a bunch of you guys asked to see
a review on this and compare it to I did
a review on the Lancome stick foundation
and the I can't think about cover facts
no what's my favorite stick oh the mega
primer stick foundation so let me know
down below if you guys would want to see
a first impression on this then I got
this elf cool bronzer I think I'm gonna
do a whole one brand tutorial using elf
because I have so many of their products
that I think I place an elf order like
six months ago to do a video on that and
I just never got around joy
that will probably be coming this looks
very dark but that light shade looks
promising that actually might be like a
nice under eye setting powder like
highlight we'll see this is the elf
prism eyeshadow I think I've heard
really good things about this palette
let's just crack this open looking nice
this could be a nice like wedding thing
I think I'll be doing an affordable
wedding tutorial so this might be good
for that got the elf makeup mist and set
the aloe green tea cucumber vitamins A C
and E kinda sounds less less like a
setting spray like to make your makeup
last longer more just like a refresher
or to make the powder look less powdery
on your face but we'll see if it
actually helps the makeup stay on longer
unlike on a major mask addiction right
now this is the detox Giovanni I think
the brand is Giovanni detox system
purifying facial masks it's got really
good reviews on there and I think it was
like 6 bucks or something activated
charcoal volcanic ash and super
antioxidants it will try us out tonight
I usually update you guys on this kind
of stuff on snapchat so if you're not
following me on snapchat it's the tail
of snaps you should go follow me say hi
then I almost peed my pants when I saw
this they have the Physicians Formula
eye booster on there you guys know is
like one of my Holy Grail products when
the
or the liquid eyeliner you have to get
the ultra black shade it's the blackest
I love this makes making the wing
superfast easy nice I picked up another
one in my Real Techniques makeup sponges
this and the pure cosmetic sponge are my
favorite two sponges not a big fans
Beauty Blender I don't know why it just
doesn't work as well for me as this I
feel like I get a lot better coverage
using the Real Techniques sponge and
this is nice because it's like six or
seven bucks has a flat edge it blends
out the foundation really easily without
soaking up a lot and without taking away
some of the coverage so I'm a big fan of
this sponge I I don't know why I picked
this up but I'm gonna give it a go this
is the user in q10 anti-wrinkle face
cream I don't know if this just had
really good reviews why did I pick this
up I don't know this is like a
anti-aging cranium fragrance free
alcohol-free non comedogenic I have like
25 base cream so I'm not sure why I
picked this up but now I have 26 I just
realized that aquaphor and user in
packaging is like almost identical
that's interesting are they owned by the
same company then I got the aqua for
immediate relief lip repair so many of
you guys told me on snapchat to try this
for my dry lips I don't know what
happened but out of the blue
probably like two months ago my lips got
super cracked I haven't been able to
repair them since then my lips I really
like peel off you guys say this is the
best so we're giving it a go right now
this now solutions white toothpaste I've
never tried more of like a naturally
whitening toothpaste I just made a whole
video on my teeth whitening and how I
keep my teeth white so I will link that
in description box down below cuz it's
fluoride free SLS free gluten free
paraben free pretty much everything free
got some bit old coconut oil this is
from the now Solutions branch mint tries
out for my hair I've never actually used
coconut oil on my hair you can use this
to remove your makeup you can put it on
your hair you put on your body there's a
ton of different uses for coconut oil
underneath this hair or to my hair
African fried right now I've been using
the olaplex number 3 and a deep
conditioner and a bunch of different
stuff so I'm gonna try with coconut oil
and
if that helps but parts of my hair like
literally like straw right now from the
bleach then I got another thing by now
Solutions this is the Moroccan red clay
powder I don't know why I was really
drawn to this but this is like a facial
detoxifying mask and you basically mix
it with water it says it's an
all-natural powdered clay you basically
apply it like the Aztec clay mask it
sounds like so I love that mask this one
I'm curious to try this is the now
essential oils tea tree hundred percent
pure tea tree oil I've been obsessed
with my diffuser the past few months I
use it mostly at night to like relax I
don't think it's helped my migraines
I've tried a few different ones for
migraines like putting it directly on my
skin mixed with like a really call it
transfer oil can't remember
you basically have to mix it with an oil
to like dilute it before you put it on
your actual skin but this I'm going to
try using the diffuser tea tree oil is
also good for acne so my try just mixing
this with like my facial moisturizer or
something and putting this on there are
ton of different uses for essential oils
and I've been getting really into it
lately I just love like the smell of it
and the sound of it it's super relaxing
to me alright the last thing is this
laundry laughs that was fun I saw these
mini brushes on here and I was like
really drawn to them even though I have
five billion brushes literally these are
like travel-size mini brushes not the
softest not horrible but definitely not
the stuff oh this one's pretty soft we
got a little eye blender brush in here
you have like a blush or bronzer brush a
little shadow brush so that was
everything that I got if you like this
video and you want to see more hauls

don't already make sure you're following
me on snapchat Instagram Twitter I'm
