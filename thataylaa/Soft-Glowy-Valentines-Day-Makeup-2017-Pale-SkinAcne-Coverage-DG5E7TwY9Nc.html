video if you guys want to see how I got
this look you're in the right place just
keep watching this shirt I got from
Macy's and I feel like it's perfect for
Valentine's Day
got a little skin showing but it's not
too much still classy and this is cool
because it actually has a lace underlay
none of has the scrunch sleeves right
here this necklace is from Topshop a
while ago and then my gold choker that I
always order is from Brian Anthony's
have a discount code for you guys it's
in the description box to this and then
my watch is Roomba time so I've already
washed moisturize in prime my face I do
have a little bit of concealer on some
acne spots I was running errands before
this so I haven't tried this foundation
calm before but I've been playing around
with mixing this concealer if you guys
saw my drugstore first impressions video
I love this concealer it's just way too
dark so I can't use it under my eyes but
I want to try and mix it in with
different foundations and see if it
works this is the Physicians Formula
full coverage insta ready concealer so
Bing amateur I mix it in with the Tarte
rain force of the seed foundation today
in the shade of porcelain just to see if
it adds a little bit of coverage and
this shade I can wear on its own it
actually is a tiny bit yellowy for me so
I'm going to see if this helps kind of
neutralize out the foundation a little
bit guess I need a foundation brush
trying this it cosmetics brush this is
brand new obviously I think I've used
this for powder before about not about
liquid foundation glue the whoo it looks
a nice so it picks the rainforest of the
sea because I wanted a foundation that
makes your skin look like your skin just
a little bit better and for me that is
what the reinforce of the sea does you
guys know it's one of my favorite
foundations it lasts really well
throughout the day on me if I set it
with a powder and it just looks nice and
glowy and like skin it doesn't look
heavy when I go on first dates which was
pretty rare now but went through a
tinder and bubble phase and when I was I
would wear this foundation because it
just looks really nice and it doesn't
look like too much I'm really liking the
tone of this with the concealer mixed in
so instead of doing a second layer I'm
just going to spot conceal because I
want my freckles and stuff to still be
coming through I just want my acne to be
covered up so I'm gonna use my Tarte
shape tape concealer in the shade fair
favourite concealer lately actually
pretty much ever
using my je 38 brush but more suitable
in this out it's what I use the spot
conceal and for under my eyes in my
opinion this is one of those products
that actually is worth the hype I went
back to my Urban Decay Naked concealer
the other day just to see
and I just like this one so much more
this doesn't crease as much for me and
it just sets I really like the way it
kind of sets underneath your eyes so
every single time I set my under eyes I
use my stargazer pressed white powder
this is a white powder so if you don't
have fair skin this will be too light
for you it does have color that comes
off on it it's not translucent but if
you have more of a pale complexion this
really helps to brighten your under eyes
and it doesn't feel gross and chalky and
it's like five bucks on Amazon so you
can't go wrong I want to keep the do
enos on my forehead so I'm just going to
set this part of my face with a powder
just so I can easily blend everything on
top of it so we use the maybelline
superstay better skin powder in the
shade 10 this one is a bit dark for me
for the last few months my go-to eyebrow
product has been this guy this is
amazing it's benefit precisely my brow
pencil I have to shade for I still need
to go up a shade I just have this from
when my hair was like the lighter gray
color
this pencil rocks it is totally worth
money in my opinion I mentioned this in
my yearly favorites video it's just the
perfect consistency not too waxy and not
too slick construction great so one of
my favorite contour products is actually
an eyebrow product this is the elf
eyebrow kit in the shade light this
shade right here is amazing for contour
if you have pale skin when you guys are
saying this Monday's video is actually
all about my favorite contour products
if you want to see that video I will
link it down below and in the little eye
thing over here it's not you actually
not too warm so it's nice when you're
going for more of a natural look and I
like to kind of cap on my contour before
I go in a blend just so it doesn't blend
away any of my foundation and this is
the wet and wild brush I love this for
contouring
I'm going with the rosy pink blush so
I'm going to take this shade by Milani
this is tea rose can remember how
pigmented this is after I apply my cheek
product you always go back in with my
powder brush and just kind of blend it
everything out I'm going to put a tiny
bit of that blush on my nose to give
some color for a highlight and use one
of my favorites of all time Physicians
Formula I'm using a lot of Physicians
Formula right now this is the shimmer
brick strip whatever the heck this is
called in
warm nude actually this was one nude
desai save the other one actually this
is natural nude natural nude and warm
nude are both beautiful and we're going
to take a mix of these lightest four
shades there's a white a light champagne
color and kind of a pinky color just
gives you the prettiest freaking glow
and I'm bringing this more on the apples
of my cheeks too so when you look
straight on you can see the globe keep
it though I'm going to set my face using
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray I also love the hard candy setting
spray in the black bottle that's one of
my favorites also the L'Oreal infallible
one if you want drugstore options take a
setting spray shower I'm so paranoid
that my Mike's gonna randomly turn off I
think I literally check it every 30
seconds for eyes I want to go for
something pinky but a little bit more
natural I just want really fresh open
eyes so I'm going to take this essence
qn1 eyeshadow and liner says it's
waterproof case you're going swimming on
valentine's day creamy eyeshadow is
basically just an eyeshadow pencil I'm
going to put this all over the lids
really pretty kind of rose champagne
color why am i holding it like this I'm
gonna blend that out with my finger a
little bit if you're using any kind of
cream eyeshadow product this can kind of
serve as your primer to it provides a
base for everything the stick to 9 out
of 10 times when I'm doing my makeup I
just use the same shade leaves for
contour to put my crease it's just super
quick and easy and you don't have to
find another shape use and this is the
end 511 brush you think I would know
these so now I'm actually going to go
back and with this Physicians forming
the product and take this second trade
right here we're going to put that right
under the brow bone these you can
totally use as eyeshadows as well I
think I want to put this all over my
lids this is the L'Oreal infallible
iced lattÃ© these shadows are awesome if
you've never tried these from the
drugstore they're bomb they're basically
like press pigments are super creamy you
get a lot better color payoff if you use
your finger so I'm just kind of placing
it with a brush first and I'm going to
go back in with my finger and I'm
bringing this right up into that crease
color yeah you just get way better color
payoff
finger since we're gone for a really
open bright kind of look I'm gonna put a
nude eyeliner on my waterline this is
the Rimmel scandaleyes liner in 0:05
nude this one is less noticeable since
it is nude if you want to you to go in
with a full-on white eyeliner and that
also helps to really brighten up your
eyes I'm going to go back in with the
contour product and just put a little
bit of this on my lower lash line just
on the outer half you definitely don't
need to wear false lashes do whatever
floats your boat whatever is comfortable
for you if I was gonna put on a thin
coat of mascara on my top lashes and I'm
going to go in with some really natural
falsies you could totally just put on
mascara and call it a day
lashes I'm using are the kiss risky I
think that's what these are these are
really similar to the Ardell wispy
lashes my favourite lash glue hands-down
is the kiss strip lash adhesive it has a
little applicator so you don't have to
worry about squeezing out of a tube it
dries really quick it stays on for
forever so for the bottom lashes I use
my wet and wild mega length mascara I'm
going to line and I think also fill in
my lips with this this is the Rimmel
exaggerate innocent liner and I want a
little bit more of a pink lip so I'm
going to go in with this Jordana
gorgeous peony just put that right over
top this smells very scented like whoa
this has been my favorite lip gloss
lately this is the MUA brand
baby pink I use this in the hidden
drugstore video and ever since then I've
been hooked on this thing if you have
pale skin this is the perfect light
light pink lip gloss you can wear this
on top of pretty much anything I don't
like the scent of it it has a really
strong chemical sense but other than
that a little bit all of the makeup
