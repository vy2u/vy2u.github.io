pop ultra satin lip and his is neon
this is when there are new shades this
is the shade naked naked ladies so this
morning I filmed my everyday foundation
routine which is this look so link that
video down below if you missed that but
this is just what it looks like at the
end of the night it's just gonna be a
casual target whole I went to Target did
some damage actually I'm in a burrito
there so that was exciting so I got some
clothes and dollar spot stuff and spring
stuff and then just some random
household stuff which I'll probably show
you guys too I'm always like really
interested in what people buy for their
house so the first thing I got was a
total like impulse buy but this is a
makeup bag clearly and this is a travel
bag it has so much freaking room this is
a Sonia Kashuk brand by the way Sonia
Kashuk always comes out with really
pretty makeup bags like every season
there's a different one and I was just
so drawn to this for some reason I kind
of a ton of trips coming up literally I
think every month I'm going to Iceland
in May for two weeks so that's coming up
I don't think I've ever told you guys
that go to Iceland next month and then I
also just have fun to random like
smaller trips so I figured I should
probably get a huge s bag this is store
all of my toiletries and makeup so it
has this really nice flap in the middle
where you can actually put stuff in and
I think this is upside down so you could
put like makeup brushes and stuff right
here and then it has this little flap
that goes over it then it comes with two
plastic baggy things right here and then
there's a huge storage compartment right
there but I love this size for traveling
because it's flat and I feel like it
just acts easiest and I think this was
$24.99 and it has a really nice
waterproof e cleanable material I got
two cards from the dollar spot whenever
I see cute affordable card so there's
like birthday cards or whatever I always
pick them up because you never know when
you're gonna need a cute card I got
these two this is obviously a birthday
one these were both $1 which I feel like
is really good for how cute these are I
don't think this does anything on the
inside it's just like a sparkling flower
I also got two
Oh bags for gifts because I always just
keep these so I don't have to
last-minute get them this one I thought
was really cute happy birthday bag and
then I just was like so drawn to this
because it's hombre these were both a
dollar two from the dollar spot do you
recommend target dollar spot used to
actually be a dollar like now all the
shows like three and five dollars
speaking of three dollar items we have
this journal which I totally did not
need another impulse buy Thank You
Target
this says dream big on the front which I
actually just noticed and then it just
has some fine paper good old like
journals usually as gold ends on the
paper I just thought this would be good
for sticking in your purse
if you gotta write something down even
though I usually just put it in my phone
but we'll see so I picked up a couple of
shirts I always have a really hard time
with spring and summer fashion because I
just don't like showing a lot I don't
mind wearing like shorts and stuff but I
just hate wearing tank tops I can't even
find summer shirts that I'm like really
comfortable in I liked these because
these are super lightweight they are a
long sleeve but you can it has the like
scrunchie sleeves so this could be a
quarter sleeve so it was a really pretty
material I can wear this to work this
one just fit really cute has this like
scrunching thing on the top and I feel
like with a necklace and just genius and
flats this will look really cute pretty
sure this was oh here's the tag
this was 22 99 I got the size small I
like the yellow I like the colors
feeling it this is another shirt I got
it this actually fits really cute if you
saw my snapchat I tried on the orange
version of this and I was snapping this
whole day by the way so if you're not
following me on snapchat it's the tail
of snaps basically like vlog this entire
day also sidenote
super drunk dude in the Target fitting
room shout-out to you sir you made my
trying on experience very memorable so
how does this like crocheted neckline
and then it's also crocheted on the
sleeves which is really cute and I feel
like with a gold necklace this will look
really pretty
is flowy it's comfortable they have it
in a few different colors and this was
$19.99 I picked up some of my Neutrogena
makeup remover wipes I love these I've
been trying to hold off buying these
because I have so many makeup removing
oils and like balms that I've been
trying to go through before you purchase
these but sometimes you just need a wipe
like there are those days and I can't be
bothered to put oil all over my face
these are just quick and easy
and they do the job so I got this elf
palette which I'm really curious about
this is the bronzer pellet in bronze
beauty
and I love their illuminating palette
wearing it today and I really like it
really like more red tomans bronzers
less orange E and more red if that
exists so I'm hoping ooh that one looks
like it could be a winner so it looks
like it has two shimmery shades and then
a couple matte ones and they had a
contour palette too but the contour
probably looked a little bit more Orange
II excited to try this I picked up
another one in the maybelline instant
age rewind concealer this isn't shade
110 it is too dark but I have this white
powder that I've been setting my under
eyes with and I feel like it might be
like enough with that I love the
consistency of this Maybelline if you
came out with the concealer like two
shades lighter
you'd be a lifesaver do you really like
this concealer if you don't have pale
skin try it out okay have a few home
stuff and then the rest of the stuff I
got was food so I've already put that
away
whoa they smell really intense these are
dishwasher pods really exciting this is
the up-and-up brand they were just the
cheapest it says it compares to cascade
complete dish packs I don't know we just
need more dishwasher things haven't use
these before okay
really excited about this so this is the
café Bustelo they're expresso pots for
your Keurig I'm pretty sure this is the
copy that kathleenlights used in her
cubed and coffee video I'm in this weird
like really really really strong coffee
thing right now I went on a two am
shopping spree on Amazon and ordered all
this like Turkish coffee which is
on Twitter if throw me there it got a
little intense apparently it's really
dark and it's really good I was super
excited to try this no you're adulting
when you're excited about cleaning
products but I found the peony scent of
the Meijer cleaning supplies which this
is limited edition and I didn't actually
find it when it first came out and I
think it came out like last spring so I
don't know if they really brought it
back for this spring or what but it's
super excited about this it smells so
good and it's just really pretty this is
the dish soap mmm smells so good and
this is the multi surface cleanser I
think that's everything I got if you
guys liked this video and you want more
hauls give it a
sup so I know I think I'm going to be
having a spring clothing fashion haul
coming soon because I'm a pile of stuff
that I've recently bought sitting in the
corner of my room so let me know down
below if you guys would want to see a
spring clothing haul again I'll link my
everyday foundation routine that I'm
wearing right now down in the
description box below if you want to
check it out
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
