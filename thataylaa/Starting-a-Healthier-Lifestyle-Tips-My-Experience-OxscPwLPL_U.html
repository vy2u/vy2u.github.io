Ricky yeah all right so today we are
going to be talking about starting a
healthy lifestyle you guys know I'm all
about that breed of life donuts you name
it but I have been making an effort over
the last I would say like three months
now to actually start a healthier
lifestyle I definitely wouldn't consider
myself completely there yet this is all
a journey and it's all a process and I
kind of wanted to document that and
share with you guys maybe we can all do
this thing together what sparked this
whole lifestyle change I guess you would
call it is a couple months ago I started
watching Marissa lace on YouTube if you
haven't seen her vlogs in particular I
would definitely recommend them she does
a lot of like meal prep and just talks
about macros and all this fitness stuff
that she does and it just got me really
into it and wanting to like learn more
and venture into the fitness world
growing up I would say it was a pretty
active child I did gymnastics and tennis
my parents would like force me to go on
runs with them and bribe me with M&amp;amp;Ms
along the way seems a little kind of
productive now that I think about it but
it works back then that actually be
freaking great like if every mile you
run on the treadmill the machine just
like pops out an M&amp;amp;M this video isn't
gonna go super deep into my history and
all of that but basically I went abroad
in high school I gained 30 pounds which
on me if you're 4 foot 11 it looks like
60 pounds so I basically spent that
whole summer working my butt off dieting
eating healthy working out and I lost
all of it within about six to eight
months since then I pretty much
maintained the same weight my goal is
never to really into lose weight as long
as I feel comfortable in my body and I'm
happy and I feel healthy that's what's
important to me this video isn't gonna
be a like how to lose weight video this
is just small things that you can do to
feel better about yourself
and start becoming more healthy so the
first thing I've done is started to set
realistic goals for myself and the kind
of person that I'm like black or white
all or nothing I really like workouts
like the 30 Day Shred because when I see
a 30 day timeline I can visualize that
and it seems doable to me when I think
about working out for a lifetime I kind
of
jump out a window so for me just setting
realistic goals for myself I try and
work out two to three times a week some
weeks it happens some weeks it doesn't
it really depends on my health issues as
well so setting realistic goals for
yourself whether that means working out
or officious eating healthy or fish
starting to eat healthy or drinking more
water that's been a big one for me
whatever it is start out small and work
up to it it'll seem a lot more doable
and you won't get as discouraged if it
doesn't happen for me since I have a
full-time nine-to-five job outside of
YouTube eating healthy has been the
biggest struggle for me it's so easy to
just like pick up Taco Bell or pick up
something on the way home from work but
it gets super expensive I start feeling
gross about myself and I'm just not
eating healthy at all you know when you
get to a point that junk food tastes bad
that's when you need to re-evaluate your
situation
dinners in particular are really hard
for me because by the time I get home
I'm just so exhausted that I like don't
want to do anything and I'm just
starving I started using blue apron and
I'm really excited that I get to partner
with them for this video and share with
you guys you basically send you a
refrigerated box of pre-portioned
ingredients which is nice because you
don't have to think about it all the
meals take under 40 minutes to make
which is great if you're someone like me
who doesn't have a whole lot of time on
their hands to be trappin vegetables and
things their ingredients are actually
fresh ingredients like thumb affront
from okay from a farm you know how many
times it just took me to say that super
nice because you can go on select what
meals you want and then you can choose
the delivery days you can skip a meal if
you want to you can cancel at any point
I believe for the two-person box it's
$69 and that includes three different
meals you can either let go halfsies
with your roomie or what I like to do is
prep a couple of the meals on Sunday and
actually take the second half of the
meal to work the next day so I get six
meals out of it works for me do whatever
floats your boat if you guys are
interested in trying out blue apron
which I highly suggest illegal link down
below where the first 50 people can get
their first two meals for free hell yeah
my next tip for starting a healthier
lifestyle is using your legs and walking
what a concept
I try and make an effort to walk
anywhere that's walkable first
doesn't always work out for me because
then I end up carrying like five bags
back to my apartment but if I want
coffee or if I'm trying to get breakfast
on Sunday morning I try and make an
effort to walk that exercise that you
get and those calories that you burn do
add up I take the stairs every day I
work just doing small things that add up
and to go along with that treat yourself
and buy some new workout clothes you'd
be surprised how motivating cute workout
clothes are it makes you want to wear
them and once you're actually in the
workout clothes
you're like 90% of the way to working
out my preference is neon but whatever
floats your boat this is making me look
really tan old Navy is a really good
place to get affordable workout clothes
also t.j.maxx you can find stuff like
there are places to get affordable cute
workout clothes my next tip is get a
magic bullet and make some green
smoothies I am NOT a nutritionist this
is just what I've been doing camera just
died what were we talking about
basically the magic bullet has changed
my smoothie game I never used to want to
make smoothies before because it's just
such a fricking struggle to like pull
out the blender clean the thing
afterwards magic bullet you literally
just put all the ingredients in the cup
flip it upside down and then it starts
blending I kind of just play around with
ingredients but I always put spinach in
and I always put chia seeds in putting
spinach in is just such a good way to
get more greens in your diet you can't
taste the spinach I swear I usually put
in frozen bananas mango spinach chia
seeds and either almond milk or coconut
creamer coconut cream right super low in
calories and it just gives like a
milkshake texture to it that's like my
secret ingredient can get the magic
bullet for like thirty dollars I think
or 25 dollars on Amazon I'll link it
down below my next tip is finding quick
at home workouts that you can do so you
don't have any excuse to not do them I
don't go to the gym I don't have a gym
membership
I either workout outside but most the
time just in my room my personal
favorite is my girl Jillian Jillian
Michaels I personally love the 30 Day
Shred even if I don't do it every day
for 30 days I'll just throw it on and do
whatever level I'm feeling that day it's
a really good intensive 20 or 25 minute
workout those are like the easiest
workouts for me to wrap my head around
sugar fitness has some really good
workouts on YouTube that are free you
can find Jillian Michaels for free as
well on YouTube
most of the workouts do you don't need
any equipment for PopSugar has really
good ones that you just use like towels
and like things around the house my next
tip which I kind of mention at the
beginning is to drink a ton of
water I didn't realize how dehydrated my
body was before your body needs a half a
gallon of water every day and I was
drinking nowhere near that was probably
drinking like 1 to 2 cups of water per
day
once I started drinking more water I
started noticing a my skin clearing up I
just overall felt like I had more energy
if you're not a big water drinker try
getting like a cute water bottle for me
and I found that having ice-cold water
is so much easier to drink whatever
makes it easiest for you do it my final
tip is to just embrace who you are in
the moment for me it's more about
feeling good I'm trying to put my health
number 1 right now for me so doing small
things that helped me get in a healthier
habit and lifestyle so I hope this is
helpful for you guys if it is give it a
thumbs up so I know let me know if you
guys are into these kind of videos and
you want more like fitness journey
