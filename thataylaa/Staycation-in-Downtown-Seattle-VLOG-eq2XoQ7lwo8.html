let's go get burritos we just checked in
kind of we're like waiting for our room
to be ready so we're gonna go look at
the pool
ooh look at the gym oh hell yeah I
should have brought my shoes
look at the view as you're like working
out that is unreal
oh my gosh this is so nice
oh that's so cute how freaking nice is
this oh my god the little YouTube thing
thank you guys see what our view looks
like I would feel like I mess up these
hotel currents I look like a freakin
diva right now it's got back from the
pool and my concealer is a hot mess
right now
how do you open your scripts the pool
was so nice I'm pretty sure I got
sunburned I'm getting a facial in about
an hour and a half so I want to go down
there a little bit really so I can just
sauna and like relax and chill this is
such a nice weekend like I feel I
already feel rejuvenated and relaxed I'm
just pulling them I feel like this is
wrong oh my gosh we have a water view so
pretty that's water hard to tell right
now because kind of hazy let's do a
little tour I'm really excited to eat
strawberries that looks bomb we have a
full-length mirror here this closet
looks Jai Norma oh oh yeah there's like
summit doors to it can when you just
appreciate this countertop so many
Instagram photos are gonna go down right
here what oh my god I think this is
actually a TV on the mirror no way
holy ships keys okay we don't need to
watch Donald I've never seen that before
at a hotel
this is unfreakin real holy crap this
tub I didn't even turn around do I even
need to go to the spa this is so nice
I'm starting to get a migraine because I
was out in the Sun for so long so I'm
just gonna relax for a little bit in
here
so I just got out of a facial and my
skin that feels so nice
it's like glowing if you're in Seattle
go to the Four Seasons and get Betty as
an esthetician she was amazing it's so
I'm gonna try and hang out down here
somewhere and I can skating right now so
we'll see but I want to take advantage
of the time I have here so I just got
back from the facial and it was freaking
amazing my skin feels so good right now
and I showered there and went in the
steam room and sauna and stuff and it
was so nice I tried to film but it was
super awkward because there was people
in there and they don't want to be like
intruding on their privacy and things
you know I'm hoping that my migraine
thing kicks in right now I wanted you to
go to Goldfinch tavern which is like
down below here and it's supposed to be
really good but I'm not feeling too hot
so I think I'm just gonna order in some
stuff Rach is up Walgreens right now I
think she forgot something I don't know
not even capturing it but look at the
frickin sunset right now migraine
because what else would happen the guy
was super nice and brought up a
microwave so I can heat up these towels
I don't have my hot water pack which I
usually put on my face
it's just Monday morning and the first
thing I was saying all morning good of
having a pretty killer migraine last
night so we didn't get to do much which
was a little bit of a bummer but it's
Monday morning I'm up super early right
now I showered and got ready for work
because Monday is about coffee delivered
they give you free coffee how cool is
that
look at this month I think the mic is
more exciting than the coffee right now
time to leave pretty soon for work I'm
attempting to tame this hair so I didn't
bring any hair products great choices
Taylor
headed to work now I am so not awake
right now it is 7:15 in the morning I
wish we could've like stayed and enjoyed
everything for a little bit longer today
but unday people Monday thank you so
much for seasons it was such a nice
little getaway and if you guys are in
the Seattle area or if you're planning
on staying in Seattle it is the nicest
hotel the pool was freakin amazing
I would like pay just to go there for
the day and use the pool it was
seriously beautiful staff was super
friendly everyone was just amazing it
was a good time I've never driven
downtown when there's like no traffic
this is weird
this is like my favorite little street
