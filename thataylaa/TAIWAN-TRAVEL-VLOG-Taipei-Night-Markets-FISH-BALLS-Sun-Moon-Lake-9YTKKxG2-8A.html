heck is in a flat wait like what's the
difference between this in a latte in a
cappuccino I don't know all I cared
about was having three shots of espresso
in my body I leave for Portland tomorrow

here so I can pick something up for my
trip so excited gonna hang out with
Valerie and Keegan Mallory 17:12 but I
got back yesterday and Seattle at like
10:00 a.m. which was I don't even know
like 3 a.m. or something and I had so
much energy I don't know what was
happening I did two loads of laundry
finished editing a video was basically
wide awake until like 2:00 p.m. set an
alarm for an hour to get my wash out of
the dryer ended up falling asleep for
seven hours and slept until 8:30 p.m. so
I just wanted to wrap up this video I
hope you guys are liking these vlogs
they take forever to edit but I love
having the footage just to look back on
and everything watching those logs was
always really crazy to me because I
don't realize how much I forget until I
watched them Taiwan was amazing I could
have spent literally another week or two
there looking back I wish I did a little
bit shorter in Shanghai and then more
time in Taiwan because we didn't even
get to do like the taroko gorge or
anything so I definitely want to go back
to Taiwan when I do South Korea and just
go like up and down the coast and see
the west coast more you can surf in
Taiwan definitely recommend Taiwan I
feel like it's totally underrated it is
beautiful and just the food and the
people and everything I just loved it
