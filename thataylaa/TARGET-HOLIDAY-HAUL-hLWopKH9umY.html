obviously to target and dollar tree like
always I went in to get a freaking tiny
ass tree right here and came out $98
later I don't want to talk about it
literally think it may be impossible to
go to target and get one thing it's
impossible to target on the search for
this tree got the tree and got five
thousand other things that I did not
need it's kind of a collective holiday
fashion haul let's just ignore what I'm
wearing I don't know what happened but
we're filming now so I mean it does say
dear on it so it's a little bit festive
I don't know it's an impromptu video you
should see my setup right now I hope the
lighting is somewhat okay I put it on
like winter mode or some and we
have a guest star year today with us if
you can see him this is Bentley i'm
currently dog sitting and this guy has
to pee every hour then like a five-story
apartment building so that's fun I feel
like the lighting is off whatever we're
gonna go so the first thing I got what I
came there to get was this tree which
was eight dollars three is called the
art tree they had these in a bunch of
different colors but I wanted it to go
with my room and so I just got this
little white tree um not much to say
about it it's a white tree it has a
little base didn't get the skirt because
the tree skirt is eight dollars like who
is gonna spend eight dollars on a mini
tree skirts so you're going to use once
a year holy crap this is heavy bunch of
random at target so it's going to
know
particular order just whatever I pull
out first the first two things are
bagels this is your Franz blueberry
bagels they're bomb to see bagel pins
everything bagel 110 calories not the
best important to me clearly because I
still bought the regular bagel next food
I guys she's it's reduced fat these are
just like the snack packs because I need
something to eat between like on break
at work so I got shoes it's because I'm
super healthy another work item super
necessary sugar-free rockstar I don't
want to hear about your health comments
in the downbar I know they're horrible
for you I don't care they give me energy
and weirdly like the taste of the sugar
free ones better than the other ones
thing is the naked grape her breathing
so formal I just like saying that way I
don't know I'm going over to my friends
for thanksgiving so I thought it would
bring wine and the outside of this one
looked pretty classy what do you think
do you think it looks classy then I got
these three gift bags which work ok I
need to seriously stop looking at them
here the first one says the best gift
ever and it's sparkly and pink and I
just thought it was really cute I don't
know have a lot of birthdays coming up
so I might use that and these two I
thought would just be good for like
random presents for people over the
holidays and all these were in the
dollar section ok chill the out and
then I got an eyelash curler because
surprisingly enough i do not have an
eyelash curler in my collection but this
one is by elf it was a dollar says it's
new and improved has an extra little
rubber thing don't know about that but i
kind of want to try it right now I
really have never used one of these
before I don't know why I don't feel the
need to and I'll see you dramatic
difference let's do it again let's give
it a few pumps people okay that's a
little bit better I can't see a drastic
difference besides they're now being an
eyelash in my eye
next target bag over here this bad boy
ok so to go on this tree holy
glitter is everywhere looks like Ke$ha
was in town i got these ornaments at
target they were two for a dollar and
they're just silver bows and i thought
they would look cute whoa that was
really fast I thought they were look
cute on the white trick and then I also
got these LED mini lights they're just
in white for the tree and these were
eight bucks like what the for a
mini tree but you need the lights I just
wanted it the whole look to be pulled
together with some lights so I thought
yo lo and i bought a dollar light guys
actually what went through my mind in
target then we have a frozen pizza that
is no longer frozen last little piece
for my tree is obviously ornaments these
are just over and sparkly and and
then there's also like a matte one in
here I don't even know if use the word
mat for like non makeup items but I feel
like we naturally just do these are
three dollars to favorite items that i
purchased today we're sweaters holy hell
people all of target sweaters right now
are forty percent off and it's not even
black friday yet obviously i had to buy
some the first one that i bought is just
plain and black and boring but it's
really long so i like it because if
you're wearing leggings it covers your
butt and I could also wear this to work
so I thought that would be good it's
really comfy too this was originally 27
and I got it for 1679 which is amazing
and now looking back on this I feel like
I should have gotten more to one is my
absolute favorite sweater that i have
ever owned in my entire life this like
chunky cable knit button-up sweater
which you don't button you know you just
don't grey has like this thick collar
it's super loose and flowy and oversized
and it's so comfortable I cannot wait to
put it on my body and this is also 1679
originally 27 and I had this in like
three other colors i think and i want to
go back and get the black one because i
just feel like
I'm going to wear this every day /
sleeping it and/or shower in it oh my
god and lo and behold the last thing i
got at target was won a pair of foot
bliss oh I didn't realize these were
footless these are just opaque black
tights to wear with these leg warmers I
got now on to dollar tree tour deluxe
dish liquid detergent it's blue soap
people it's a dollar pad my favorite
glasses in the entire world back in
stock so I stocked up there are these
super cute glass coca-cola I don't know
if you can like see that but they're
glass coca-cola cups they're like the
perfect weight and the perfect thinnest
around the lid they have like a little
bit like green tint to it I don't know I
just think these are adorable and I want
these to be all of my cups when I move
out into my own place after I graduate
so I'm like slowly stocking up whenever
they get them back in store then I got
to Hanukkah cards one for Grandma one
for the parents Happy Hanukkah don't
forget to light your menorahs people as
I'm like pulling out Christmas
decorations right now the only reason
why I got red and gold is because our
entire apartment is like red gold brown
theme so I thought it might be kind of
weird throw in some like blue and silver
Hanukkah but I don't know garland
red and a golden silver I was going to
twist these and then hang them up if you
follow my Instagram then you'll see a
picture if you don't then you won't see
a picture and you should follow it same
as my youtube username bentley is very
excited about these you should see him
behind here some more garland but this
just has these gold sparkly matt luster
balls hanging right here are you all
good in the hood so then to hang on the
first Garland's I show you I'm going to
what be putting these like bold bows and
these gold little circle wreath like
ornaments on their Bentley what are you
doing then I got some deodorant I don't
know if that's youtube appropriate to
show but everyone wears it this is the
lady speed stick and powder fresh I just
got this for my purse because I don't
like having to like switch everything
over when I go to work I was everything
I got also holding garland during now
but we're just going to go with it
