it's actually kind of chilly today I'm
so excited
making me excited for fall I'm wearing
socks and I have a blanket on my lap
what I guess when you guys are saying
this it'll almost be fall but when I'm
filming it's still like full-on August
all right so today it is day seven and
fifteen days of foundation we are almost
halfway done crazy
so I try out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days 6 p.m. Pacific
time days 1 through 6 are linked down
below and a playlist if you've missed
any if you're new here welcome to the
burrito family don't forget to subscribe
so today's foundation is kind of
throwback this is the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage foundation when I
started getting into foundations and
like playing around with higher end ones
this was when the first foundations I
try it out I actually have a really old
video using this I like to throw in a
couple of these kind of foundations once
I've already tried out years ago but
might not necessarily like in these
areas just to see if my thoughts have
changed at all and give it kind of a
second chance
I did this with Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation in last series this is just
one of those foundations I've always
heard really good things about but just
never worked for me so I'm giving it
another shot today this is consistently
one of the most asked about foundations
so I figured let's do an updated video
on it as I was doing my 15 days of
foundation good old research on Sephora
I was reading some of the reviews that
people had left about this foundation
and I came across this gem here you go
this is for your viewing pleasure I mean
if that's not the best for review you've
ever read what is I'm glad that girl
took one for the team
those foundation retails for $39 but you
actually get 1.7 ounces of product in
here which is a lot typically you get
one ounce of product it comes in twenty
five shades I've the lightest shade
ivory which has fair skin with pink
undertone but I can tell you the
lightest shade ivory is not super fair
and it also looks like they only have
about two deep shades so seems like
there's 25 shades of like medium I'm
insert swatches right here so you can
see how the shade ivory compares to some
of the other foundations that I owned I
feel like I almost just hit myself in
the face of that right so swatch time
right here is the Tarte Amazonian clay
foundation in the lightest shade ivory
next over is derma called 2:08 which is
my closest shade match pure cosmetics
bare it all in porcelain also a really
good shade match for me even though
these two look totally different Urban
Decay Naked Skin Foundation and 0.5 and
Maybelline
me matte and poreless in 110 so reading
some of the claims on Sephora's website
says it's a long lasting foundation
powered by Amazonian clay that imparts a
matte finish so I have combination skin
I get pretty oily throughout the day so
we'll see if this Amazonian clay helps
to control some of that says get 12
hours of flawless coverage long wearing
skin perfecting formula SPF 15 full
coverage supremely buildable weightless
texture and that's it
the packaging of this I like I think
it's just kind of you know simple but
cute squeeze tube kind of reminds me of
Washington Oregon very hippie organic e
organic E is now a word so that's all
the information on this foundation if
you've been enjoying 50 days of
foundation and you're excited day 7
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up let's jump into it if you want to see
my thoughts and how to apply somewhere
to start the day you're in the right
place just keep watching alright so I
actually feel pretty shitty right now
but we're gonna roll with this and hope
I can make it through this video so it's
949 so I actually didn't watch my old
video on this foundation because I just
wanted to come at it with like a fresh
first impression you know what I'm
saying
haven't used this in years probably
about five years four years do you
remember that I could never really make
it look good on my skin I think I used
to mix this to wear it I'm gonna use my
morphe damp sponge on one side of my
face and then I think I'm gonna use my
ELF foundation brush because this one's
typically good for like denser kind of
cream foundations so I already washed
moisturize primed my face
it looks very mu C on the back of the
palette it feels like it's drying super
fast like you put it on and then it's
kind of they're kind of frustrated cuz I
woke up at 6:30 today worked out and I
was planning on starting filming really
early and having like a super productive
day and then had to take one of my
migraine pills and have felt like
the last few hours
the pills started to kick in but I feel
pretty crap right now but I wanted to
get the foundation on at least I could
start the wear test it's hard to do
these videos when you have to start it
late in the day so I like to keep them
on for like ten hours I'm gonna film
this part of the video and then
hopefully come back when I feel better
in film the intro looks slightly yellow
but I think it can work getting about
medium coverage you can still see
redness and acne and stuff coming
through down here not totally full
coverage doesn't look particularly good
on the center of my forehead but on my
cheek area it's looking okay there's
certain parts where you can just
see it almost looks a little bit dry
like around my nose area right here well
let's try the other side with a sponge
this is not applying well with the
sponge probably because of its moosie
kind of consistency that was very light
coverage and I switched the brush
because I feel like I'm just gonna waste
product if I keep using this sponge and
then it may be smooth out with the
sponge afterwards it looks pretty dry on
my forehead right now the way that this
is sitting on my skin reminds me of the
Loreal Pro matte foundation which I have
a whole other review on just looks dry
I'm not getting great coverage I don't
love the finish of it I wanna see if I
can build this up since it didn't really
cover my acne and stuff down here and
it's supposed to be full coverage so
it's building I still wouldn't call this
full coverage even want those two layers
you can still see like pigment coming
through so if you have acne I mean on my
skin it doesn't look full coverage even
on my forehead where I really don't have
a lot to cover up it seems like it's not
totally covering there either just kind
of smoothing over everything with the
sponge to try and take away some of the
texture you have any kind of texture
acne I mean that's emphasizing
everything my skin just looks really dry
by the way got new earrings yesterday it
seems to be setting down yeah I feel
like I could definitely blend product on
top of here right now it's ten o'clock
I'm gonna do the rest of makeup and I
will be right back right so it's no 1049
the rest of my makeups on we're gonna
call the check-in time ten o'clock
because that's when I finished out my
face makeup I actually did end up
powdering my face but we're still gonna
call the check-in time 10 o'clock since
I was literally at like 1002 I used my
favorite it cosmetics celebration
foundation elimination if I used a
powder in one of the foundation videos
one of my like four or five go to powder
because I know what they do I know how
they perform wear throughout the day and
everything this is my favorite powder
when you have a foundation that looks
like total this just like revives
your skin makes it look like skin again
and that's kind of what it did to this
foundation the foundation by the way did
offset eyes about half a shade within
like five minutes even with the powder
on top I don't feel like it looks good
enough to the point where I would wear
it again either on its own or with the
powder on it we'll see how it wears
throughout the day if it's the
long-lasting it might be a good one to
make
in with other foundations but I can tell
you off the batch I do not like this one
on my skin on its own if this powder
can't fix the foundation you know
something's up basically it just
looks pretty heavy you can see it
already creasing around like my nose
area center of my forehead looks a lot
better with the powder on it now but it
does just look a little bit heavy this
powder does add a little bit of coverage
too you can still see my acne down here
because I didn't bring the powder down
that far but I did get a little bit more
coverage after setting my face so on the
rest of my face for bronzer highlight
and blush I tried out these new makeup
forever there's like different trio duo
options and they're basically just
magnetic pans that you can stick in here
I'm gonna have the exact shades listed
down below but I went in with this
lighter contour shade this highlight is
super pretty if you like a pinky kind of
purple highlight really like that I also
really liked the blush shade I tried
this one is beautiful it has a little
bit of like a glow to it I tried out the
pure My Little Pony palette for the
first time I actually went to this
launch event in LA this is first time I
tried out the palette and it could have
just been the shades that I used I used
to shade generosity right here which is
that matte one that one was nice but
then I went in with stormy King and
attempted to put that on my lid and this
shade is pretty horrible there's like
almost no payoff you really have to pack
it on I tried using it wet dry with a
brush with fingers a shade just really
did not work I ended up having to go in
with the pure trolls palette and I used
this shade guide diamond right here
which is beautiful ended up putting that
on the center of my lid Gold's palette I
love every shade of used in here it's
beautiful matte shade shimmer shades
this one definitely a different formula
I'm gonna keep playing around with it
and see if some of the other shades are
good ideas kindness which is the yellow
shade on my lower lash line I ended up
having to use to make a Forever aqua
Excel and m4d to get like the rill
yellow going so I don't know I'm gonna
give this another shot play around with
some of the shades I didn't use but so
far I'm not super impressed with this
one you guys know tell you what I think
about something no matter what and that
one I'm not feeling right now and then
lips I totally forgot about this
lipstick if you want like the nudist
nude liquid lipstick ever this is B
elegant in the shade nudist I don't even
know if they still make this it's kind
of like an indie brand but I'll link it
down below if they do and then I use the
BH Cosmetics lip liner in C
d so I think that's everything pill
kicked in feeling a little bit better
right now
ten o'clock check-in time next check and
ID will be in natural lighting so I'll
see you guys in a few hours okay so it's
now two forty five sets been on for
almost five hours so besides the shade
being too dark with the powder on it
looks really nice right now it's wearing
pretty well the only area where I don't
like how it looks is around my nose area
upper lip and like down here it looks a
little bit heavy yeah you can see it
like creasing around here and on my
upper lip it just looks like you can
totally see it around here my forehead
looks really good my forehead looks
smooth right now here's what the rest my
face looks like so right now I would say
it's wearing pretty well we'll see how
it looks by the end of the night see you
guys it is 8:20 so it's been on for a
little over ten hours and I just got
sucked into Quantico which I've never
seen before just watch like two episodes
it is so good so far I'm like into it
had deposit to do this check-in so even
though it still looks not the best
around my nose area like it has all day
it has held up really well it's not
breaking down the whole lot I've
definitely been earlier especially with
this powder it still just looks kind of
like dewy
it doesn't look Whaley I think these
lights are kind of like reflecting off
even more but it really doesn't look
that way ly in real life so I do think
it's held up well on my skin I would
definitely not wear this by itself I
don't like the dryness texture of it
just looks pretty heavy on my skin alone
but I do think I would mix this in with
maybe something like derma call it's
like lighten it and smooth it out and
see if the Tarte helps make it last
longer
so we'll try mixing this one I do think
this could be a good mixer for me don't
like it on its own I'll say this one
it's probably best for oily skin dry
skin I think this would be a complete
disaster on does it look dry on me have
you tried this one let me know what you
think I know a lot of people love this
foundations I hope you guys liked this
video if you're excited for day eight
tomorrow don't forget to give this a
thumbs up
love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
