fifteen days of foundation this is where
we're trying out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days if you missed him
I'm milling the first two days down
below we did the Elsi foundation and the
what do we do yesterday cover facts
stick foundations they were doing a
first impression on the Tarte rainforest
of the sea foundation and concealer
Tarte UN for foundation name of the year
like who came up with this look at this
packaging the packaging just speaks to
me it's a glass bottle hombre lid
situation going on so the foundation
retails for $39 and you get one fluid
ounce of product there are 12 shades
online doesn't look like a ghost super
dark it looks like there's a lot of kind
of middle skintone shades I have the
shade fair neutral fair skinned with
yellow and pink undertones you'll see
how it applies and how it looks when we
do the demo reading some of the claims
on sephora's website it says it's light
weight full coverage hydrating
foundation infused with tartes
rainforest of the sea complex who knows
what that means
and non-chemical SPF 50 and sunscreen I
have combination skin with cystic acne
and a lot of SPF foundations break me
out so I'm hoping this one doesn't since
its supposed to last 12 hours and it has
a concentrated full coverage fluid
formula with 20% water 2.20 which is
such a growth work with 20% of water to
quench dry skin as it covers and masks
any redness dark spots and uneven skin
tone what else is interesting it has a
drop applicator which you'll see you
sell it with their own brush but unless
it's like a super revolutionary brush I
never really purchase the brushes that
come along with foundations I think you
should be able to wear a foundation
without buying a $40 brush you know I'm
saying it did purchase the concealer
though this is the rainforest of the sea
concealer is this supposed to be medium
buildable coverage I don't think you
should have a concealer with buildable
coverage you probably don't want to be
like layering up your concealer
underneath your eyes sounds like it
would be a hot mess to me but we'll see
throughout this whole series I'm taking
your guys's recommendations so make sure
you leave a comment down below letting
me know which foundations you want to
see next I do have some drugstore ones
coming up I wanted to do that today but
both of the drugstore price products
that have our stick foundations so
didn't want to do
three days of sticks a dress or
foundation will probably be tomorrow if
you're excited about 15 days of
foundation make sure you give this video
a thumbs up if you're new here subscribe
and join the burrito family so if you
want to see how this foundation applies
and where's throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching who's
pumped
I feel weirdly energetic right now and
it's like 7:45 in the morning and I
haven't had any coffee yet
correction 736 I think I'm just super
excited to try this foundation right now
I think I am going to prime half my face
just so if you can see a difference I'm
using the Laura Mercier foundation
primary this isn't the illuminating one
let's do the right side this isn't the
illuminating one this is just the normal
one so it shouldn't affect the finish or
anything too much I did wash dries my
whole face like always with the shisei
dough Multi solution gel so clearly have
some pretty bad breakouts going on right
now this is actually a lot better than
last night I have a huge one down here
my skin is not happy right now so I have
the foundation and concealer right here
I also have my morphe e30 one brush
which I'm going to use on half my face
then I have two makeup sponges here this
black one is more fees new premium
Beauty sponge haven't tried this at all
I just wet it for the first time and it
actually feels really nice and squishy
so I feel like you can usually tell
beforehand when you buy this but it's
going to be or not so this one
feels promising and it has a flat top
right here which I'm super excited about
and it's pretty huge like look at this
thing so I think I'm going to try this
on half my face and then if this is
go in with this one ooh pretty bottle so
I'm going to assume that you shake it so
online it says for light coverage use
one to two drops and for full coverage
use three to four drops and it says to
put it directly on your friend Asian
brush so that's what we're going to try
it first typically I like to put
foundation on a pallet and then dip my
brush into it and then put on my face
hate to get product in here you actually
pump this thing so one two boom the
10-spot three four I don't know if I
needed to pump that much in now that I'm
looking at it so one
two three four
okay that looks like it was all soaked
up into the brush I'm going to try
dabbing it on my face first round two
okay much better doing it that way
getting some coverage looks super
natural on the skin
yeah you can't actually see any anything
whoa okay so far it's about a high
medium this looks very promising getting
to a full coverage so I'm definitely
going to be going in with a tiny bit
more after we do this side of my face
but so far I really like the finish of
it looks very skin light but still gives
good coverage right now it's looking
like kind of a satin finish which I love
not too doing not too matte we'll see
once it actually sets in definitely
getting lighter coverage on this side
but it still looks nice if you just want
a light quick kind of coverage so let's
go back in with the brush so I'm just
going to go in and add a tiny bit more
wherever I feel like I need full fuller
coverage but so far it's looking really
nice like it's sitting super nice on the
skin shade wise actually looks pretty
dang good you'll definitely be to darken
oxidizes and it's not too yellow builds
beautifully look at that coverage still
looks like skin doesn't look cakey or
anything
SARS how it went on with the foundation
and primer it went on about the same
actually didn't even notice the
difference until I just thought about it
right now I think both went on pretty
much the same really liking this so far
all right so now onto the Aqua concealer
it says that this is a serum concealer
in this medium buildable coverage does
say to shake well says it's supposed to
last 12 hours and has smoothing benefits
q Jess one this reminds me of the
Clinique foundation and I also did a
first impression on what looks pretty
watery that's interesting so Wow feels
super watery I'm going to blend this out
first don't know how fast the skin j4d
whoa all right first impressions I don't
think I've ever felt a concealer this
liquidy definitely see where they going
with the whole serum thing so coverage
and finish wise it actually reminds me
of the
you two-faced boring this way concealer
however I like the way this one settles
a lot better it feels like it actually
sets under there and isn't going to
crease as bad since it is that super
fine or liquidy formula I don't have
horrible under-eye bags or anything so
coverage wise this is okay for me whoa
smells very strong kinda smells like
nail polish definitely not the fullest
coverage concealer but it's kind of
surprising I didn't think I'd like this
so much so far I like it it's not
creasing usually by this point if I
don't set it with a powder it starts to
crease it's not facing at all yet here's
a quick close-up so you guys can see how
it's sitting on the skin without setting
getting a tiny bit of creasing right
there but without setting with a powder
it looks pretty damn good look at that
my skin just looks super smooth I love
the finish of this and definitely feels
a little bit sticky still alright so I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
I will be right back alright so it is
8:21 the rest of my makeup is on I
probably should just film the video on
this look because I used to see a ton of
new products the liner got a little cray
using black gel black liner which
everyone talks about I've never tried
this until today and I now understand
because you just want to keep going
blush bronzer highlight blend it out
amazing on top of this I literally had
to blend like half the amount that I
usually do I did set just my cheek area
and a tiny bit on my t-zone with the big
cosmetic celebration foundation
illumination but I just love the way
that this is sitting on my face it looks
super smooth my skin looks like skin it
looks hydrated and it has amazing
coverage on my lips by the way is color
pop little stitches ultra satin lip with
a little bit of the wet and wild
Jaqueline mode also set my face with the
hard candy fast and fabulous makeup
setting spray that I use everyday like I
said it's 8:20 right now I'm going to
check back in a few hours I'm going to
take all this off around 4 o'clock so I
have to go to something but we will
check back throughout the day right now
looks great
okay so it's 1:27 now so the foundation
has been on for about 5 hours now
a very productive morning kind of feel
like I'm getting sick my throat feels a
little funky but it's all good when you
take off colour-pop liquid lipstick it
literally turns your lips fuchsia most
bizarre things okay let's take a look
everything looks pretty much the same as
when I applied it five hours ago I feel
like I look nice dewy not like oily dewy
at this point getting a tiny bit oily on
my forehead nothing insane I think it
just looks really good it looks healthy
it feels really good on my face I don't
feel like I'm wearing a ton of makeup
like I said I'm going to keep this on
till four o'clock so about two and a
half more hours and we will see how it
looks okay it is now 4:13 so the
Foundation's been on for about eight
hours change the lip color yet again
fuchsia was driving me insane
this is Oprah's Aries with a little bit
of Dubai over top yeah I'm filming
earlier today I filmed the fat pit fun
unboxing video which is up by now when
you guys are watching this and I was
editing the footage looking back on it
and the foundation looks super good on
camera it still looks really good in
real life it's been on for eight hours
and it looks pretty dang good it looked
a little bit oily on the forehead area
nothing horrible it doesn't feel really
like it feels like it's totally on the
way it's sitting on my skin just looks
flawless I think I've ever had a
foundation that look so much like skin
with this amount of coverage I feel like
if you're not someone who like super
full coverage you could definitely share
this out just use less of it I'll play
around with different powders cuz I do
think I could be a tiny bit less oily in
my forehead but everywhere else I think
it looks incredible oh the concealer
totally forgot about simulators
full-time and the primer so between the
unprimed side of my face and the primed
side I think they look identical what do
you guys think
yeah the conceal looks really good
actually there's very minimal creasing
still think I like the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer better than this if
you're looking for more of a light
weight less coverage kind of concealer
or say like this if you have dry skin I
think this would be beautiful on you
give oily skin I
it's not horrible I think if you had a
good mattifying setting powder this
might be doable for you if you have more
mature skin I can also see this being
good for you I might tell my mom to get
this and try it out because of that thin
consistency it might be good for
wrinkles and more textured skin I think
it makes my face look super plump
moisturize healthy I'm super happy with
this and you guys know that I don't say
that about everything I feel like I'm
usually pretty harsh on foundations and
products and this one I like I do think
it's worth it to try this out if you
don't like it you can always return it
but I'm going to be keeping this I wish
I could put this on my face tomorrow but
we're going to be testing out another
foundation every weekday my videos go up
at 6 p.m. Pacific time if when these
videos is falling on the weekend which
