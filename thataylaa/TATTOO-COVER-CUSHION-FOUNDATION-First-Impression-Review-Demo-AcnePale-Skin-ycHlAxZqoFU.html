ever this is like the shirt of YouTube
remember this shirt alright so today it
is foundation Friday this is where I try
out a new foundation every single Friday
on my channel 6 p.m. some time a couple
months ago a bunch of you guys were
messaging me to try this I think there
was kind of a viral Facebook ad going
around or something that's usually what
happens with these kind of products this
is a cushion product I have reviewed a
few other cushion foundations on my
channel this is the secret key tattoo
cover cushion anything that has tattoo
cover in the name or description of the
product I want to try out because you
guys know I like my coverage has SPF 50
in it I've the lightest shade which is
21 light beige there are only two shades
in this cushion Korean cushion products
usually only have about 2 to 4 shades so
you can get this on eBay Amazon yes
style I'll leave a few links down below
but it kind of ranges from about nine
dollars I've seen it up to like 23
dollars just pending on where you get it
might actually got off of hot liqueur
look if you want to get fancy which is
Nordstrom's flash sale site so I got it
for 19 bucks but it actually comes with
the compact the product in here and then
a cushion refill so technically get kind
of two-for-one this is supposed to be a
full coverage cushion foundation which
is what kind of drew me to this
initially I mean the name is tattoo
cover so it's coverage plus
moisturization at once
whitening wrinkle sunscreen three in one
last long without darkening effect so
probably doesn't oxidize it says it
covers freckles troubles flushes so
that's pretty much all of the claims I'm
gonna swatch this cushion products and
compared to a couple other cushion
foundations and some other foundations
just so you can see how it compares
alright swatch time so right here you
can barely see it I feel like but this
is the tattoo cover foundation in the
lightest shade 21 next over is the
Maybelline Dream cushion in the shade 10
the jcat Beauty cushion in the lightest
shade 101 I think this is the lightest
cushion foundation I've found so far and
then the Mesha intensive cover in 21
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless 110
derma called 2:08 which is my closest
shade match and the laura geller cover
lock foundation in porcelain my
foundation Friday Lewis is linked
blowing the description box if you want
to go back and watch any others if you
are excited for this video don't forget
to give it a thumbs up let's get into it
so if you wanna see what I think of the
secret key tattoo cover cushion how it
applies and wears throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching okay it's 943 Saturday October
7th when I'm filming this
this video is pre-filmed because I'm
currently on accutane and you guys are
seeing this I just made matcha hot
chocolate you guys probably can't even
see this nope it is so bomb if you don't
like the taste of matcha put it in some
chocolate can't go wrong the ready wash
moisturize and primed half my face again
using the Laura Mercier foundation
primer I just primed this half of my
face I like the packaging matte black
but with this holographic kind of thing
the cushion is already in here so you do
get a refill cushion so that's awesome
that it comes with that so with cushion
foundations this part always oh this one
doesn't really snap this part you want
to shut fully after you use it so air
doesn't get in and dry it out but you
remove the overlay and there's the
cushion I'm gonna kind of just try
applying this a few different ways with
a sponge a brush and then with the
applicator that it comes with typically
this works pretty well with cushion
foundations for me but sometimes a
sponge does work better alright so here
we go my acne is pretty bad right now
breaking out so let's go in with this
thing first I'm just gonna press down
one time Oh get a lot of product out
with these kind of applicators you kind
of like press and roll whoa oh it smells
good
I was find it's kind of hard to get
right in your nose with this applicator
so off of that one layer cut pretty good
coverage hi I would say high medium and
it looks really nice and smooth if you
have texture on your face cushion
foundations are usually pretty good
about being kind of like smoothing and
they just look really flattering on the
skin I love them Nisha magic AM cushion
I think Evan told video on that but I
still use it I still really like it for
when I'm like running late
typically on my skin since I have combo
oily skin cushion foundations don't last
the longest they're kind of more like
moisturizing I usually get oily a few
hours in but I do like wearing them if
I'm just running out to go do
or something or if I just want a little
bit lighter coverage I just want my skin
to look really like fresh and glowy and
natural but that just covered pretty
well so I'm gonna go in with my morphe
sponge I always use and just press
directly in here and let's see how it
does on this side looks like about the
same coverage to me I think I got a tiny
bit better on this side it definitely
didn't cover my acne as well I'm gonna
try the sponge for my forehead oh
forgot about a brush okay maybe I'll
blend this out with the brush is the BH
number-two brush just a flat top kabuki
it feels like it dries way faster it
with a brush since you don't have that
like moisture pressing back into it
I think with this I definitely would use
a sponge over a brush just gives like
the most flawless finish look at that
looks so pretty on the center feel like
a little bit of this goes a pretty long
way I do want to see if I can get a
little bit more coverage down here I
wouldn't say this is like extreme
coverage or anything at this point it
definitely wouldn't cover a tattoo if it
can't cover this I think it looks like
about high medium coverage even on my
forehead where I don't have a whole lot
to cover up my acne and freckles and
stuff are still coming through so I'm
gonna go in with a tiny bit more product
and see if we can build this up I'm not
gonna put it around my nose or places
where I get kind of creasing I'm just
building it up on my acne to see if
it'll cover it looks really good on my
forehead like very smooth the center of
my forehead looks really nice on my acne
I still would need to spot conceal its
just not totally covering I'm gonna try
and use my finger actually and just kind
of use this as a spot concealer says
it's supposed to be a concealer oh that
didn't work that's like taking it away
never mind
so this is supposed to be kind of a
concealer and cushion at one I feel like
I actually get a little bit better
coverage with tamesha magic I'm on two
layers so right now it's 956 I am gonna
powder my face with this because tend to
get really oily since they're more of
like a moisturizing dewy product I think
I'm gonna use the Laura Geller balance
and Brighton powder one of my favorites
and I'll be right back okay so it's now
10:30 but we're calling the check-in
time 10 o'clock since that's when I
finished up powdering the face so it
looks really nice even with the
powder on top you can't even see the
powder at all but now and friend the
window to see and it just looks very
smooth and natural I mean you can still
see stuff coming through so I feel like
didn't totally cover but I think it just
looks nice and natural and kind of glowy
so I don't mind it that's pretty typical
with cushion foundations for me but I
don't think this is like very very high
coverage I just did super super basic
makeup today because I'm going to like a
dog-walking real a thing later I'm that
person who doesn't even have a dog and
is going to play with other people's
dogs so the rest of my face I use the
bare minerals fair to light invisible
bronzer blush is two-faced Papa don't
peach highlight I used the Becca
gradient glow I tried this out in first
impressions video my eyes are very basic
my eyelash extensions are officially off
so my lashes are super short right now
so I just put on my eye booster eyeliner
mascara i always use will be linked down
below and then for lips i did a weird
combo good luck trying to replicate this
first i put on the maybelline superstay
matte ink and 0-5 but i didn't like how
it looked so I like rubbed it off but
there were still some left over so then
I put on Mac gossamer wing which is a
luster this was super pretty I would
wear that on like a natural makeup kind
of day and then I put on over top the
mac lipglass in under the sheets and
that's it super basic so check in time
10 o'clock the next check that I do will
be in natural lighting so I'll see you
guys in a few hours
okay so it's now 333 so it's been on for
five and a half hours I just picked up
Jimmy Jones and I'm stoked on life right
now so hungry my forehead looks friggin
bomb still looks pretty good on the rest
of my face very minimal creasing around
my nose and upper lip so that's good I'm
going to zoom you in so there's the
forehead it actually looks worse on
camera I feel like in real life you
can't really see all this stuff I think
the camera is actually picking up on
more than what I can see in real life
tiny tiny upper lip creasing but this is
like nothing compared to usual try get a
tiny bit shiny around my nose and a
little bit on my chin as well but I
still think it looks pretty good at this
point a second
I'm gonna be out and it is like raining
and I think we're gonna be walking for
that thing I'm gonna try and check in at
eight o'clock the 10-hour point but it
might be longer than that since gonna be
out okay guys it is 12:30 in the morning
it's been on for 12 13 14 and a half
hours no that can't be right
10:00 to 10:00 yeah 14 and a half hours
what the heck there are people over when
I was doing my last check-in so I just
did a quick shot of what my face looked
like so I'm gonna insert that right now
so you can see what it looked like a few
hours ago but I just looked up close in
this mirror and fourteen and a half
hours my face looks pretty good right
now for me of course I'm oily on my
forehead and around my nose I've
definitely been more mad but it doesn't
seem to really be majorly separating or
breaking down I've definitely had my
foundations look much worse at this
point for sure
with that being said I feel like I still
like the Mesha m-magic I looked it up a
magic cushion foundation better I don't
know there's something about that one I
just feel like I get a little bit better
coverage one looks very similar on the
skin still looks really natural if
you're debating between a cushion
foundation I think I would still go with
the Mesha one over this so being a
tattoo cover not quite as much coverage
as I was expecting but I feel like we
touched on that 50 times in this video I
should probably just go to bed and you
know what words are coming out of my
mouth at this point if you enjoyed this
