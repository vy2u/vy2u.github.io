that you just want to completely black
out
all right so today it is the wrap-up and
ranking for 15 days of foundation season
for 15 days of foundations where I test
out a new foundation every single day
for 15 days all four of the playlists
will be linked down below in the
description box if you miss any of the
seasons or you just stumbled across this
video and you're like what the heck is
this I'm very excited we have a lot to
talk about today I sat down for about
five hours yesterday and finished up my
notes I have freaking three will as I
hit myself in the head three pages of
notes here so basically what the wrap up
videos are as I go through all the
foundations and rank them one through 15
from best tours this series was
September 1st to the 15th but I actually
started filming day one on August 8th so
since it took me about a month to film
this series I've actually been trying
out the foundations for a while now but
as I test them out I basically try them
with different primers powders mix them
just try and figure out a way to make
them work even if I didn't necessarily
like them if you're in a burrito and you
found my channel through this series
this time around welcome thanks for
being here I'm excited to have you I
also do a foundation Friday every single
Friday and my channel is 6 p.m. 6 times
the foundation videos will continue that
playlist is also linked down below so
grab some coffee grab a drink get some
food this is gonna be a long friggin
video I can already tell alright so
let's do this if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up if you want to know my thoughts on
each foundation and how they rank 1 to
15 you're in the right place just keep
watching I technically talked about 16
foundations this time around because the
Lottie London all about that base
foundation was a total fail in the estee
lauder nude video that was like a 2 in 1
so I'm not gonna be talking about this
one today because we all know this is my
least favorite this is like number 16 so
just for the sake of 15 so people don't
get confused just know this is number 16
I'm also gonna insert swatches of all 15
foundations right now just you can see
the shades compared to each others is
slightly difficult to get all in the
same frame but I think oh no we're
missing one there we go
so all 15 foundations are right here if
I had multiple shades of a foundation I
just went with the lightest one because
they would not have all fit on my arm so
I'm just gonna get closer a little bit
and go through all the shades so these
are in no particular order at all these
are not like
best works are worse the best or
anything cuz they don't want to ruin the
surprise so these are just in a totally
random order
first off right here is the do our air
flash foundation in the lightest shade
100 Sephora make no mistake foundation
concealer stick in the lightest shade
zero one driftwood YSL all hours
foundation in BR 20 Laura Mercier
flawless fusion in one c1 shell tar
Amazonian clay in ivory Burt's Bees
goodness glows in porcelain bare
minerals bare pro in Fair 0-1 Estee
Lauder Double Wear nude in 1c one cool
bone two-faced peach perfect in snow
dermablend flawless creator drops in n0
models own runway matte foundation in
porcelain Catrice HD liquid coverage in
10 fenty beauty foundation in 110 my arm
is cramping right now Clinique acne
solutions in 0-1 fresh alabaster lol
alabaster okay
and last is Tom Ford waterproof
foundation and concealer in 1.5 cream
alright so those are all the swatches
let's go into the ranking I have combo
skin with cystic acne I get oily
throughout the day just my foundation
disclaimer every product works
differently for different people I know
you said this 5000 times but I feel like
it is important because some people love
certain foundations that I despise and
vice versa we all have different skin
types texture we all have different
opinions on different products because
we have different experiences with them
so it doesn't mean one person is wrong
and one person is right what wears well
for me might look horrible on you and
vice versa so this is just my experience
with products me sharing what worked and
didn't work for me if you have my lowest
ranked foundations our foundations that
I know a lot of people have loved so
just want to put that out there always
do your own research watch different
videos don't just watch my video if you
like foundation recommendations you can
kind of think of as like perfume
recommendations usually if someone
recommends a perfume and you know you
have a couple of perfumes already in
your collection that they also love you
might also like the third one that they
recommend I feel like the same as with
foundation you see my train of thought
there let's get into the ranking alright
so I'm pretty sure we can all guess what
number one is
it is the two-faced peach pervade
comfort mat foundation
this was actually one
the last foundations I reviewed this was
a weird friggin series by the way I
didn't even touch on this in the intro
but what the heck was up with this
series there were so many rejects
ranking these was actually really hard
because I was literally ranking like 12
of my least favorite foundations the top
ones this time we're pretty easy for me
it was the bad ones that I was like I
mean they're all bad but anyways number
one this one totally surprised me if you
guys follow me on snapchat I talked
about how I was even debating getting
this because it just didn't appeal to me
the whole peach thing the scent just all
of it it didn't sound like something
that I would like but you never know
clearly the sin actually doesn't bother
me because it's a totally different
scent than the peach eyeshadow it
doesn't have that super super artificial
peach scent it smells just more sweet to
me
because there are full reviews on each
foundation I'm basically just gonna
touch on my overall thoughts on each one
how I mixed it any new findings and all
the foundations with their reviews are
gonna be linked down below in the
description box so you can check them
out so overall I would say this is a
medium coverage satin matte foundation
that is transfer resistant which is one
of my favorite things about this
foundation it looks beautiful on the
skin it doesn't cake up it wears amazing
throughout the day on my skin I did like
a transfer test in that video you can
forget hug yourself you know if
someone's not hugging you it doesn't
transfer you have oily skin this holds
up amazing throughout the day this would
be my perfect perfect foundation if it
was a tiny bit more pink toned I have
the lightest shade snow and it is a bit
yellow I find and if it had a little bit
more coverage this would be like my
ideal foundation today I'm actually
wearing it mixed with the Laura Geller
cover lock foundation this was my number
one foundation and think that was the
last series makes these two today and I
feel like it actually makes to a really
great shade this one is very jewy has
great coverage so I feel like these two
mixed together I mean I think my skin
looks pretty good right now I like how
it looks I probably won this one now
about five six times since filming this
video tried mixing it in with matte
foundations like Marc Jacobs remarkable
what else I'm looking at my notes the
cover effects drops I definitely like
this mix better with high coverage
luminous products like the Josie Maran
Argan it mixed well with I can wear this
one on its own again I just would spot
conceal since it's not quite enough
coverage but
dude this is friggin beautiful if you
guys have tried any of the foundations
I'm talking about let me know what you
think of them down below because I'm
always really curious to see how
products where for you really don't have
anything bad to say about this if you
have texture and you have issues with
foundation like settling into any
texture or fine lines I mean this one
looks great on my skin number two is
also one that completely surprised me
this is the estee lauder double wear
nude water fresh makeup this is one of
the most beautiful dewy foundations I
have ever put on my skin it looks like
skin but it actually has better coverage
than I was expecting you can get this to
about hi medium coverage I would say
depending on if you do two layers and
how you apply it and everything but it
looks like skin it is a beautiful mixing
foundation if you have dry skin or oily
skin but you like dewy I think you might
really like this because it actually
wore really well throughout the day I
didn't get overly oily with this one it
feels moisturizing it feels great on
your skin it's light it doesn't feel
like you have a shit ton of makeup on I
really like mixing this if I have a
foundation that's super heavy and super
matte this one I mixed with Marc Jacobs
remarkable ten which is too light and
very very matte also mix it with the
models own runway foundation I didn't
like it mixed with this one I did like
it makes with the Marc Jacobs remarkable
not like my favorite combo I've ever
tried I feel like I still need to find
my favorite way to mix this but if this
has enough coverage for you on its own
and you can find a shade that matches
you and you like dewy very moisturizing
foundations would definitely recommend
this it is gorgeous by the way ignore my
nails in these close-ups I just notice
they look pretty ratchet right now
foundation number three is the Catrice
HD liquid coverage foundation I find
that a lot of really matte foundations
can just look super heavy and cakey on
my skin but this is one that actually
looks pretty freakin great it almost
looks like airbrushed coverage or
something gives you a very smooth like
canvas I feel like if you don't have
texture or if you don't have acne this
would literally make your skin look
flawless like unreal on my skin it still
looks really great I wish the shade was
light enough and I wish they had more of
a shade range the shade range on this is
pretty shitty this is in the shade 10
light beige I do have to mix this to
wear it as I continue to wear this
it kind of reminds me of the Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation with less coverage
this is very very full coverage this one
you definitely have to use more product
and it's not quite as opaque full
coverage but just the way that this
looks and the finish and everything kind
of reminds me of Marchak is remarkable
this is extremely matte on its own it in
Y the best on me throughout the day so I
feel like I still need to find a combo
that I really like with this that can
make it kind of last longer try to mix
things in with the cover FX custom cover
drops and n10 to lighten it and add a
little bit of doing this and it didn't
hold up very well throughout the day on
me so I'm still trying to work with this
one and figure out what I like this with
but I think if you can wear this shade
on its own it is beautiful I think this
one would probably work best on normal
skin if you have oily skin you might
just need to work with this and find
some kind of primer or something that
makes it last longer so this one I kind
of had trouble ranking this is number
four and it's the Dior skin air flash
foundation spray foundation I rained
this one below Catrice because for me I
just don't see myself really reaching
for this again god I love this remote I
tried this a couple times mixing in with
other foundations and it didn't look the
best if you have a combo that you like
mixing this with let me know what it is
down below mix this in with the
dermablend flawless creator drops to add
a little bit of coverage and lighten it
and in my notes I wrote that it looked
too good at first it lightened it add a
little bit of coverage but then it
oxidized
a shit-ton and it didn't really wear
very well throughout the day but let's
rewind this foundation on its own I
think is beautiful I mean you guys can
see how it wore throughout the day in
that video it's just not for me like
it's too dark it's too light coverage
but this one to me I think if you like
kind of medium to high medium depending
on how you build it up coverage and you
like satin dewy if you have more mature
skin I feel like this would look really
nice cuz it didn't settle into any of my
lines or anything throughout the day it
wore really well full spray thing just
throws me off it's not practical at all
I tried using a Beauty Blender brush
I've tried multiple different ways to
apply it it's just not very practical I
don't see myself reaching for this a lot
I do think the formula of it once it's
on your face is nice so number five and
six I kind of went back and forth
between flip-flopping them because I
couldn't really figure out which one I
should rank higher so ended up going
with number five as the Tom Ford
waterproof foundation and concealer and
number six as the dermablend flawless
crater drops so
let's first talk about this one I'll
tell you why ranked it above it in the
end this foundation like just its $85 it
is an expensive freaking Foundation
which I try not to take price into
account when ranking foundations because
because when I test them out and I try
them I just want to see if it's a good
product whether it's two dollars or
eighty five dollars at the end of the
day price obviously matters when you
decide whether or not to purchase the
foundation so I do feel like if the
foundation is $85 it just has to kind of
be out of this world and blow my mind
for me to want to keep it or purchase it
and for me to recommend it to you guys
so this one I just have kind of mixed
feelings on like you saw in the video
the coverage isn't quite where I want it
to be it doesn't look the best when you
first apply it but this war amazing
throughout the day check that video
again and go to the end see how it looks
at the end of the day because holy shit
this looks frickin flawless at the end
of the day which made me really want to
try it out and mix it in and stuff even
though I feel like for $85 I wouldn't
purchase it with the intent of mixing it
with other foundations because it just
seems kind of ridiculous but I tried
mixing this in with my milk makeup blur
liquid foundation which I love and my
notes I wrote that actually seemed to
shear out the milk makeup it didn't look
like quite as full coverage because
again this isn't totally full coverage I
tested this with a couple different
foundations I never really found one
that it really mixed well or wore really
well with throughout the day it
definitely wears better on its own I
think that combo that I wore in that
video just this foundation with the
Laura Geller balance in Brighton powder
was definitely the best one I tried it
with so far actually have a video coming
using this foundation again trying to
mix it with the derma Col it's gonna be
the everyday quick kind of makeup look
you guys will see me mixing it in with
derma Paul in that video it looked
really great at the beginning I wore
that face the whole day it just did not
wear well at all so I definitely feel
like this one wears best on its own I
think you might really like this if
you're someone who doesn't have a ton a
ton to cover up and if you have a little
bit less texture than me because I think
then it would look a little bit better
on first application maybe and it could
be worth it if it wears as well
throughout the day on me as it does on
you on you as it does on me there we go
it's just not everything I want out of a
foundation so for me it probably isn't
worth it I also just want to say if I
did
do YouTube videos and I didn't test out
a bunch of foundations for you guys to
make videos on I don't think I would
ever purchase an $85 foundation I feel
like my max would be about 50 which is
still in the higher end I think they
have this one in store in Sephora so
maybe it's one that's worth getting a
sample I mean a sample Cup would be like
ten dollars worth so get a sample of
this one you can get a sample of any
foundations at Sephora by the way so
definitely do that before you purchase
the full size if you're not sure about
your shade or if you're gonna like the
formula because then you don't waste
your money you don't have to return it
and there you go
okay so number six the dermablend
flawless creator multi-use liquid
pigment these are basically pigment
drops like the cover effects ones except
these are matte drops pigment drops are
like concentrated pigment so you can mix
them in with different foundations you
can wear them on their own I typically
only like mixing them in with other
foundations these I think are nice they
just are a tiny bit too textured I find
that anything I mix them in with it just
looks a little bit too textured on my
skin cover FX drops are very dewy so if
you like more matte and you've been on
the hunt for something like this you
might like this I like them I just don't
love them and I haven't found a combo
that I do love them with like I say in
every wrap-up video there is a line a
literal line in my notes where the
foundation is just kind of drop off so
all of the foundations above the line
are ones that I like and I would
recommend the ones below the line didn't
make the cut I think from the series we
had about six out of fifteen decent
foundations number seven is where it
starts to go downhill for me number
seven is the models own runway matte
foundation I've seen this look great on
other people just doesn't work for me
it's not enough coverage it also just
looks so cakey on me I have been using
this one to mix in with other
foundations because the lightest shade
porcelain zero one is very fair so I
think that is a bonus because it is hard
to find drugstore foundations that are
this light this shade is too light for
me so it's good to mix in with other
foundations for that reason it mixed
well not my favorite thing to mix our
certain foundations like the Estee
Lauder Double Wear a couple others that
I'm gonna be mentioning that I know look
great on other people and for whatever
reason on my skin they just look too
heavy thick and matte and cakey how many
times am I gonna say these words in this
video could work out for you if you have
a hard time finding a shade that's light
enough for you at the drugs
or you might want to give this one a go
just for those reasons all right here we
go
getting into ones a lot of people like
that just look like shit on me so here's
the way I sell all hours foundation this
is a new foundation by why I sell a lot
of people love this it looks amazing on
some people it looks amazing on one of
my best friends Mallory just looks like
shit on me I do like the coverage of
this I like the little bit of this goes
a long way it just does not wear well on
my skin at all it's definitely not all
hours or 24 hour foundation like it says
this breaks down very quickly on my skin
I get oily it does not look cute after a
few hours and it oxidizes a lot I found
a lot of these actually in this series
oxidize a shit-ton doesn't sit the best
on my skin for the price it just doesn't
have enough things I like about it to
make it worth it so number nine is the
Laura Mercier flawless fusion ultra long
wear foundation this one when I was
ranking this I was just like where the
heck do I put this thing this one word
blah like I I just don't have a whole
lot of thoughts on this one because it's
just very flawed to me didn't look quite
as bad as the next foundation that I'm
going to talk about but this one just
the shade how it oxidizes how it wore
throughout the day I feel like this is
one that I could see looking nice on
certain people I just don't see really
one thing I personally like about it
number 10 again one that I have seen
look great on some people this is the
bare minerals bare probe performance
wear liquid foundation I was kind of
bummed about this one because I really
thought that I was gonna like this just
based on the description is supposed to
be like bare minerals most full coverage
foundation which all the bare minerals
foundations in the past have been pretty
light coverage it looks so heavy on my
skin this was probably the most masks
like one I watched all of my videos back
last night on these foundations and I
feel like in that video it just looked
like someone like copied and pasted a
foundation on my face like it was just
sitting on top of my skin I do
appreciate that fair 0/1 is pretty light
so that's a plus I feel like if you like
Estee Lauder Double Wear you might like
this one because it sits kind of similar
on my skin so unfortunately this one is
a no-go for me I really wish I liked
this because again I just had too high
of hopes for this one the number 11 is
the Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation so this is one of the ones
that I have tried
before in the past it was kind of like a
redo to see if my thoughts have changed
on it since a lot of you guys still ask
about it and my thoughts have not
changed I still don't like this it just
has never looked good on my skin and it
still doesn't look good on my skin
I definitely would not call this full
coverage just look so freakin dry on my
skin if you have dry skin I don't think
this would work because on any of my dry
patches it just looks horrible I just
don't like how it sits on my skin don't
like the coverage don't like the shade
number 12 is the Clinique acne solutions
liquid makeup with salicylic acid this
one mostly ranked this low because one
it burned my skin was not comfortable to
wear throughout the day on my skin and
two I just don't get this product
conceptually if you have a foundation
geared towards people with acne it
should probably be a little bit better
coverage just because you know that
people with acne are gonna be wearing it
typically when you have acne you like
higher coverage you can cover it if
you're gonna be wearing a foundation
I love the clinic beyond perfecting
foundation it's one of my favorite
foundations that one has beautiful
coverage it sits on the skin really nice
that one I feel like would have made
sense to put cells to look acid in if
you're gonna have to gear towards acne
this one did not make sense to me
packaging and just idea kinda reminds me
of the elf acne fighting foundation
which is beautiful I wish they made that
foundation and a light enough shade
because I would wear it on its own this
one I just would not recommend if you
have acne or if you don't have acne I
don't know why you'd wear this if you
don't have acne because it has salicylic
acid in it no no all right we are
getting down there I'm sure you all know
which one is still coming every time I'm
not gonna get over this usually I have
to get up and turn on the camera again
when it stops recording so great great a
mention came in number 13 is the Burt's
Bees goodness glows liquid makeup this
one ranked this low because this is one
of those few products that I think I
just wouldn't recommend to anyone no
matter what your skin type because it's
just patchy it just applies very patchy
it clings weird again I do appreciate
that the shade one 0:05 porcelain is
actually very light and this is a
drugstore foundation also just really
bothers me that this is called goodness
glows but it's actually not that glowy
at all I was kind of envisioning like a
josie maran sea foundation kind of vibe
with this and it's not quite Jozy
in my notes for number 13 I just wrote
you number 14 my heart actually just
started like racing let's just put it
out there I really just like this
foundation this is the new Fenton Beauty
foundation by Rihanna it looks horrible
on my skin I am NOT just talking a
little bit of texture or dryness it
looks straight-up bad on my skin what I
gathered from this review video was that
a lot of people had a very similar
experience with this foundation to me
and a lot of people also really loved
this foundation so I think this is just
one that is totally different depending
on what kind of coverage you need your
dryness going into that video the people
in Sephora had told me like you need to
moisturize the heck out of your skin I
always prep my skin for foundation but
this one I really like exfoliated I feel
like I prepped my skin really well this
looked so dry on my skin I did try and
apply this a second day the second time
I tried this I put on even a thicker
moisturizer to try and like really give
my skin some moisture before applying
this and the same thing happened I get
such weird not even texture it's like
weird patchiness and dryness especially
on my forehead in places where I don't
usually get it from what I've seen and
read from comments from you guys and
watching other videos to me that seems
like a foundation that is really only
for people that have pretty flawless
skin to begin with but I do love the
shade range that is one thing that I
think is amazing about this lightest
shade is very light
definitely pale friendly shade range is
awesome I hope every brand takes notes
for RiRi I like some of the highlighters
and other stuff in the line but this one
was just a complete fail for me this was
a definite no number 15 you guys
probably all saw coming this is the
Sephora make no mistake foundation and
concealer stick in my notes I also wrote
you for this one dry clung on to
everything I didn't wear this one again
because I think I even said in that
video like I would never put this on my
face again there are so much better
stick foundations out there if you're
new to the stick foundation world Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD stick foundation is
stunning would not recommend this to
anyone
I'm actually curious though if you like
this stick foundation I'm curious like
this is anyone like this foundation I
want to know all right so that was all
the foundations ranked I'm glad at least
we got a couple winners during this

bit worried there all the foundations
