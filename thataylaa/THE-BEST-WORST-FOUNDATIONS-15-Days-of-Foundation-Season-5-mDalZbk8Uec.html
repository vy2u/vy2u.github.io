obviously we're gonna be ranking every
single foundation 1 to 15 that I
reviewed in this past 15 days of
foundation series season 5 I'm gonna
have to play this list down below so you
can go back and watch the videos this
video is where I rank all of them after
trying them for weeks now I have been
filming these videos for longer than the
start of 15 days so I've been trying
these foundations in different ways
either mixed together mixed in with
different foundations try to a different
primary setting sprays whatever it is I
just kind of go based on how the
foundation is and what I think will be
good with it I take a bunch of notes I
have like pages of notes here of
different combinations I've tried and I
go in and rank all of them 1 to 15 best
to worst so the point of this video is
not to give you the specific details
about each foundation since I have full
reviews on each one which every single
one is linked down below along with the
foundations I did all of that info in
this video this video would literally be
like an hour and a half long this is
solely to rank the foundations and yeah
just wrap it all up but before we get
into the ranking and talk all about
foundation I get to finally share with
you guys how much we raise for project
Beauty share and also what the winning
shelter and the winning city is so if
you have no idea what I'm talking about
then watch the announcement video it
talks all about the kind of charity
project that was going along with this
whole series so our goal was to raise
$20,000 for project Beauty share not
gonna lie there was definitely a few
points throughout the series where I was
wondering if I just set that goal way
too high but as usual you guys came
through I'm gonna start crying
also PMSing right now obviously feel so
grateful for you guys in just the
community that we have here and that
there are so many of you literally
thousands and thousands of you who are
willing to just stand behind something
like this and come together you guys in
the last few days
just exceeded the goal so the total
amount raised for beauty wishes 2018 was
twenty one thousand eight hundred two
dollars and ninety two cents and I
wanted to say huge shout out to someone
who commented named Deanna because we
were still a few thousand behind and she
left a comment saying if everyone
donates $1 through PayPal to project
Beauty share on their website you can
donate directly to them then we will hit
our goal and that is what really like
took it to the next level and that's
what made us exceed the goal so many of
you thousands of you donated one dollar
five dollars whatever you could through
PayPal and I just think that that's a
prime example of no matter what the
cause no matter what you're doing even
if you feel like what you're doing is
really insignificant and that a dollar
is just a dollar or you know ten minutes
of your time or an hour of your time is
just that and it's not really making a
difference this is how things happen and
this is how things can change when
thousands of people come together just
giving the tiniest amount or giving what
they can whether it's with a project
like this or whether if it's just in
your own community is just know that
even when something feels so small and
so insignificant and you feel like
you're not really doing anything it's
the power of numbers when tons of people
come together to do something like that
that is what makes a difference so you
guys should be really proud of
yourselves good why am i filming this
one I'm PMSing okay so now we're gonna
announce the winning shelter in the
winning city so there was a voting
competition going on between five
different shelters across the u.s. that
we partnered with it was so cool seeing
all the votes come in every day I think
the total was like over thirty eight
thousand votes during the whole 15 days
and it was super close between LA and
Chicago especially in the last few days
it was like neck-and-neck like there are
some points throughout the day oh check
and they would literally be like two or
three votes away but the winning city
and the winning shelter is Los Angeles
so congratulations to Good Shepherd
Center in Los Angeles for winning the
$5,000 bonus prize Good Shepherd Center
is doing some amazing work for
homelessness and women in the Los
Angeles areas so we're super excited the
$5,000 is going to them and also pretty
wild Mark Wahlberg is
supporter of Good Shepherd Center and he
actually tweeted and posted on Facebook
about this whole campaign which was whoa
like mind-blowing so thanks mark he
might have tipped the LA votes up a
little bit but so la is the winning City
that's where I'll be doing the Meetup I
can't wait to meet you guys in LA the
meetup date is Saturday April 28th so
just in a few weeks I'm going to be
flying to LA we already ever take us in
everything so it's happening since we
only had literally about a week to find
a meetup location and figure everything
out we're still working on it
so the meetup time and location is gonna
be coming in a future video so if you're
in the LA area just stay tuned for that
I'm obviously gonna be posting on every
social media platform too when I know
the location and we also have an event
bright page coming with all the details
the meetup is entirely free all of that
information will be coming since we're
working on the location we're like 99%
sure one is gonna come through crossing
our fingers because this is a very quick
turnaround to make a meet-up happen in a
different city I cannot wait to hug you
guys and meet you guys and hang out it's
gonna be a good time and also surprise
my dad which I know most of you are
probably more excited to meet my dad
than me my dad will be there my mom will
also be there if you haven't seen the
dad tag her mom tagged my dad and I have
like ten videos together at this point
and he's like the favorite of my whole
channel he's just make his own channel

guys love my dad and my dad is gonna be
at the meetup in Los Angeles so if you
want to meet my dad that is the day also
the project be assured team will
obviously be there so you guys can meet
Julie and you can just thank them for

weekend so for those of you who are in
other cities you'll still be able to
kind of see how all this goes down we're
gonna be meeting the good shepherds team
and I'll be vlogging the Meetup and
everything so that blog will be coming
but just huge thank you from the bottom
of my heart for everyone who
participated in this whole thing and
it's making it happen and again every
shelter that participated did receive
thousands of products that were donated
from the brands participating so huge
thank you again to Maybelline Garnier
color pop and Tampax who donated 17,000
boxes of tampons I think that's
everything I had to tell you guys and
that
apartment okay foundation time so here
we go with the ranking if you're excited
for this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby doe family and subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time I also have wrap-up
videos for every past series if you want
to know what my favorites were from past
series and go watch the wrap-up videos
or and binge all the other videos just
saying there's playlist so if you want
to watch you know the deal at this point
how many times can I say the same thing
I'm going to first do all 15 swatches
you can see how they stack up against
each other and you can just get a feel
for whether or not a shade might work
for you if you're around my skintone so
here we go swatches okay I literally
have swatches going up my arm like into
my armpit right now so I actually have
16 here because one of them i'm
swatching a couple shades of because
it's a new shade i picked up so you guys
since yet but these are in no particular
order because they didn't want to give
away the order these are just random the
first off we have the Maybelline fit me
dewy and smooth foundation in the shade
115 ivory next over we have the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk in the shade 3.75
Rimmel lasting finish 25 hour foundation
in 0-8 one fair ivory L'Oreal True Match
Lumi in the shade n 1/2 the cargo bag
foundation in the shade 20 and it's
interesting because as you can see like
one over here is way darker but because
of the undertone this one it is so
orange and so peachy that I think that's
why it looked so in bloom upon me but as
far as like the depth of it this one is
actually darker cosmetics by by
foundation in the lightest shade fair so
these are the two of the same
foundations these are but the hourglass
illusion hyaluronic skin tint in the
shade vanilla which I reviewed and I did
pick up the shade shale by the way
ignore my nails they desperately need to
paint them sorry Becca aqua luminous in
the lightest shade porcelain Lily
Etruscan serum foundation and lightest
shade Formentera
la girl pro matte foundation and
lightest shade ivory my arm is literally
shaking right now trying to hold this
makeup at the same time this next one
definitely looks the darkest out of all
these this is the number 7 lift and
luminate foundation in the shade cool
vanilla next is do are forever under
cover in the lightest shade 10 flower
beauty light illusion in the lightest
shade el one cover FX power play in p 20
in the wet wild cushion foundation and
lie
shade 106a here are all the swatches and
my arm is about to fall off
alright so my first few top ranks out of
all 15 are ones that I love all these
but there's the one this number one just
sticks out a little bit above the rest
so my number one ranked foundation from
this series season 5 pause this video
and leave a comment down below which one
you think it's gonna be so my number one
foundation is a flower beauty light
illusion foundation for multiple reasons
this one looks beautiful on its own so
this one my only critique is that I just
wish they had more shades this shade
isn't a perfect shade match for me I can
make it work but it's not one that I
love the way the shade is on its own for
me it's a little bit too dark and a
little bit too yellow
but this foundation the formula if you
have I think especially dry skin you're
gonna love this if you like luminous
makeup this one just sits so smoothly on
your skin looks so glowy it doesn't
emphasize texture even when I had oily
skin I typically preferred that over
like a matte foundation because that
just tends to look more makeup II if you
have oily skin you can use different
powders and products primers underneath
you don't have to totally rule out dewy
makeup because your skin is oily you can
just add different products and to make
it work this flower beauty one is one
that is pretty impossible to have a bad
foundation combo with every combo I
tried this with I really enjoyed my
favorite one is what I'm wearing right
now I mix the flower beauty light
illusion with the Kevyn Aucoin
the sensual skin enhancer at the shade s
x03 and this one and this is what the
shape looks like this one I would say is
more medium coverage on its own so if
you want to take it to the next level
add a little coverage you can mix it in
with something like this order McCall
something that's just really high
coverage I still have the glow coming
through but my smart mice more head more
so I'm good right now makes my forehead
look nice and smooth because of the
flower beauty in there and it gives me
the coverage but it still looks radiant
and pretty another combo I really
enjoyed the flower beauty to give it
more coverage is mixed in with is UA
essential high coverage cream foundation
this is just a little sample that they
sent in PR I have the full one I have a
full video on this but the shade biskits
for me mixed in with this one is really
nice gives you that full coverage and
this one is very matte but not too heavy
looking so if you like mixed in with
this
which is more gel-like and smoothing
these two together just beautiful if you
like more coverage and this one isn't
quite enough coverage on its own for you
so I really like that combo I definitely
I'm gonna keep wearing this combo
together the one thing which I forgot to
mention is that this one does have a
very sticky tacky finish so just keep
that mind if you're not into that maybe
you wouldn't like this foundation but
does have a very gel tacky finish so you
do need to set wherever you're gonna be
putting like blush bronzer highlight on
or else it's just gonna drag because
it's so sticky by the way when I'm
ranking all these I'm not going into
like the specific details about each
foundation because I have full videos on
each one this is more just wrapping it
up I also love that this looks amazing
throughout the day it doesn't settle in
it doesn't cling anywhere I feel like
this would be a good one if you have
more mature skin because of that and I
just find that it's really hard to make
this one look bad they made another
foundation that was like light illusion
full coverage edition holy-shit C's game
over so foundation number two is the Wet
n Wild mega cushion foundation I think I
would specifically recommend this one
for normal to dry skin probably more on
the dry skin side it literally just
looks like skin it does not look like
you have makeup on top of your skin it
is smoothing it is all the things I look
for in a foundation I wear the shade 106
a light ivory and it is a great shade
match for me this one I really enjoy
because I can use it in different ways
and make it kind of versatile one of the
ways when I was testing this out again
that I really like using this as almost
as like a foundation topper where I'll
just go in and after I have foundation
on I'll just put this on the center of
my forehead or in the areas where I have
a bit more texture and I just want to
kind of smooth everything out and it
just gives it this flawless kind of
radiant finish to whatever foundation
you have underneath so if you don't like
cushion foundations for your whole face
but you have a lot of texture on your
skin you might like using this just in
those areas to kind of smooth everything
out but I also really love it on its own
you can do one layer for lighter
coverage you can build it up to pretty
good coverage I do find though that I
feel like it's already running out and I
go in and press my cushion and now I
really have to press it and do it a few
times to get product on the cushion so I
feel like this is either drying out
quickly or I'm just using a lot of it
and
I'm gonna go through this really quickly
so that's my only downfall with this one
alright so number three I actually
thought was gonna rank a bit higher I
thought it was gonna be actually like
one or two but I used this the most out
of everything I tested again I think I
tried this the most in different ways on
its own again and this one I just really
feel like it depends on my skin that day
the primers everything that I use is
this one is just a little bit finicky
let's say what it is this is the Becca
aqua luminous perfecting foundation I
don't think this is for everyone I think
this is definitely more for dry skin
this is very luminous it looks beautiful
throughout the day like it holds up
amazing on my skin throughout the day
overall I really love this one I just
feel like I haven't quite found in the
exact combo of things that I'm like holy
 cease but I know I can get it there
I had this on the other day for like 18
hours or something insane like that like
from when I woke up and then I went out
at night and didn't get home till late
and I had this on mixed in with the
flower beauty like illusion and it
looked really pretty held up amazing the
whole day so I do like the lasting power
of this one for me on dry skin I just
haven't found my like exact way I love
this so I'll definitely up to you guys
right so number four I really want to
love love this one
and I do like this one but I'm not
absolutely in love with it this is the
hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin tin I
did purchase the shade shale like I said
I was gonna the shade up because vanilla
was way too pink on my skin tone and
shell was a lot better but I do have to
mix these two so she'll still isn't a
perfect shade the only thing I don't
love about this is how it sits on my
forehead so that could just be my skin
almost looks like it just kind of sits
on top of my skin on my forehead I don't
like and it does that mixed in with
other foundations too I have a feeling
that this would look really pretty on a
lot of people's skin so just keep in
mind like I always say everyone has
different skin issues everyone has
different skin products it way
differently on different people so this
one might be one that looks amazing on
your skin on my skin it is almost there
I just can't make it look the way I want
it to so like usual in these ranking
videos I feel like there's always a line
where I'm like okay these are the ones
that were pretty good or great those are
above the line and now we're kind of
going in the mid
Aereo you'll see so number five honestly
shocks me that it's this high because I
remember trying this foundation years
ago and I hated it on my oily or skin
this is the maybelline dewy and smooth
foundation so I definitely think I would
only recommend this for dry skin because
I know this is just a hot mess on oily
skin and I also don't like the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
that's always looked so bad on my skin
but this one actually looks very
smoothing and just kind of healthy the
only thing I don't like about this is
that I feel like it just kind of slides
around it has a very interesting formula
it feels like almost like butter like
it's just a little bit too slick I guess
you could say like I wish there was a
little bit more of like a gel to it so
you felt like your foundation wasn't
gonna slide around as when I don't like
enough to wear if I had all these
foundations sitting on my table and I
was reaching for one to use that day on
its own I wouldn't reach for this one if
you have dry skin and you're looking for
an affordable drugstore foundation this
could be an option for you flower beauty
is about double the cost so if you are
on a budget and this one is a little bit
out of your price range even though
still drugstore you could try this one
because I think it could work for dry
skin for a lot of people alright so
these next four number six through ten I
feel like I just need to show you this I
literally went back and forth about 15
times crossing everything out
rearranging it in my head because it's
just kind of arranging the ones that are
just very mediocre in my mind they're
not like bad enough to be at the bottom
of the list but they also aren't good
enough to make it in the top 5 they're
just they're just they're so number six
is number seven this is the number seven
lift and luminate foundation so my thing
with this one is that it doesn't look
bad it doesn't look great on my skin and
I just have other drugstore options that
I would much rather put on my face I
didn't find something that I love to mix
this with when I mix foundations I
always look for something that is the
best of both worlds so if I have a
foundation that I really like the finish
of but it doesn't have enough coverage
then I'll mix in something that has more
coverage but that might be a little bit
too make up be so that when they mesh
together they just make like the perfect
foundation so when I do try and find a
foundation combination I want there to
be something in each product that I like
and this one I just don't find that
there's enough in this one I like to
make it
a good mixing product either so I don't
like it on its own enough and I don't
like it mixed in so I'm just kind of
it's just mediocre number seven is the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi this one I also
thought was gonna rank a little bit
higher same thing I just feel like there
are other foundations that have the
similar finished luminous look like skin
and I just like them more on my skin
this one does have a pretty finish but
it almost reminds me of the Maybelline
fit me in the sense that it kind of
slides around again a little bit too
much this one can also look a little bit
streaky I did like it makes it one NARS
sheer glow in Siberia but I still get
the kind of streaks going the finished
product looks good once I got it kind of
worked in and blended out it just takes
a while because this one is more streaky
again if you're going for something
luminous just go for the flower beauty
so number eight when I first put this on
I thought I was gonna love this one just
the way that it first looked on my skin
this is the iliad true skin serum
foundation it looked very natural very
skin-like the thing I really don't like
about this is that throughout the day it
friggin soaks up your oils it just makes
my skin look old
to dry if you have oily skin you might
like this one because it really does
soak up those oils there are a lot of
oils in this foundation it's supposed to
be like foundation and skin care kind of
thing in one but it has jojoba oil in it
and one of the things I've tried during
this series did break me out so I'm
trying to figure out if it was this or
the Maybelline fit me that's kind of
what I've narrowed it down to is that
one of these ones makes me break out I
have a feeling is this one because like
I said that video ho Boyle and my skin
do not agree
I like how lightweight this is it does
look really beautiful when you first put
it on but just on my skin it just looks
progressively shitty throughout the day
it's one is pricey too so for me it's
just definitely not something that I
would recommend for that price point so
number nine if there is one foundation
out of this whole thing I have just been
wanting so badly to work out because I
feel like it's so close is the LA girl
Pro matte HD foundation
I tried mixing this in the drugstore
video I just did I've tried wearing this
literally about six different times and
sometimes it's so bad to the point where
I just wipe off my full face and makeup
like I can't even wear it throughout the
day because
is such a tricky foundation for me I
don't even know how to like collect my
thoughts with this one because there's
ten different things going on with this
one that are just a little bit bizarre
if you haven't seen the full review I
would go watch this one because it's
basically everything that happened in
that video so I mixed the shade ivory
with a darker shade in that video and I
got so patchy looking some of you guys
thought it could have been the mixing
that was causing that it definitely
wasn't because since then since that
shade was way too dark and oxidized
shit-ton I've only been using the shade
ivory because it does darken a little
bit so I find that if I use this shade
alone or mixed in with stuff is still
oxidizes so ivory is my closest shade in
this one and I still get the patchiness
so it's not just mixing it there's
something about this one that just gets
so patchy on me I don't think I've ever
been so conflicted on like the finish of
this because in a weird way it looks
good because it's so lightweight and
gives you that it almost gives you like
the airbrushed look of the Catrice HD
coverage drops but then when you look up
close it almost looks like chalky or
something I don't know I want this one
to work so bad so that's why this one is
so far down but I do think that a lot of
people will like this one I think this
is just not one for my skin type if you
have oily skin you might really like
this one I think this is the first matte
foundation out of all these that we're
talking about so if you like a matte
finish because of the price point I
think it could be worth giving a go
maybe you won't have the weird issues
that I do with this one because I
haven't heard I don't think anyone else
have these issues so it could just be my
weird skin type of thing literally under
every combination I tried with this I
just wrote horrible like I could not
find a combination that looked good with
this one alright so number 10 is the
econometrics by-by foundation full
coverage moisturizer and the reason why
this one is so low is because it looks
like a friggin grease ball and as
someone who has dry skin and obviously
likes very dewy luminous products that's
a lot to say because I'm usually all
about the glow this just looks oily like
a shittier version of the accosted CC
illumination which I love that one this
is not full coverage in my opinion if
you liked kind of the whole idea of this
I would just go with their CC
illumination and there's no
especially if you already own that
product to get this one I just think
don't even go here with this one overall
this one doesn't know for me because of
how oily and greasy asjuan looks and
also apparently they had this foundation
in the past adopt carrying it and then
did like a relaunch or something but a
bunch of you said that this foundation
has been out for like years even though
they just did this whole push this last
year I don't know if they changed the
formula but this version I do not like
this next one is just one that I do not
understand the hype number 11 is the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
this is a lot of people's like go to
Holy Grail foundation just goes to show
how definitely foundation can wear on
different people for me this one is so
so average that there is no way in hell
I would pay $64 for the full size of
this I mean this mini thing was in the
$40 range and I wouldn't even buy this
for ten bucks I really don't like that
it's called luminous silk because on my
skin it barely looks like a satin finish
it almost dries down to more of like a
satin matte and I just don't find it
should be super flattering it's medium
coverage or so definitely doesn't make
my skin look as bad as the next few I'm
gonna mention but overall it's just for
the price and how it sits on my skin is
just like definition of average
foundation for me this is like perfect
example of one that isn't really even
worth it for me to mix because there's
nothing in this that I particularly like
I just feel like I'm kind of missing
something with this one I don't I don't
see it and I want to see it it's just on
my skin I don't see it it's number 12
kind of same situation it doesn't look
particularly horrible on my skin like
the luminous silk it just doesn't look
good enough on its own or mixed in to
where I would want to reach for this
this is the cargo foundation in the bag
I love the concept of this I really wish
I liked the inside product more since
the trade of this is way too dark I did
try applying it not with the intentions
of wearing the full day just to apply to
see how it looked right at the beginning
on its own and just get more of a feel
for how it looks on its own and it
doesn't look bad it just is kind of more
light to medium coverage I do like how
lightweight it feels just nothing about
this that I'm like yes you need this
which is why it is where it is in the
ranking but again all those middle ones
are kind of like interchangeable during
this series for me all right so now 13
14 15 are one
that just don't look good on my skin at
all and I don't like the formula of
number thirteen is the cover effects
power play foundation this has such a
kick-ass shade range that I wish this
was a good formula but it just is so
cakey looking it looks so maybe on my
skin and I tried mixing this in with
every possible smoothing skin looking
foundation that I have like dermablend
smooth liquid camo CYO life proof NARS
ultra radiant and everything that I mix
this with the heaviness still came
through from this product the cover FX
actually looked really good at first
mixed in with the dermablend smooth
liquid camo but after about three hours
it just started looking so heavy so
cakey and I feel like that's just the
theme with this one this reminds me of
the way Kat Von D lock-it tattoo
foundation sits on my skin if you have
had similar experiences with that one I
definitely would not recommend getting
this foundation I did try using this
with the Smashbox primer oil underneath
because sometimes this can really help
to kind of thin out and just smooth out
thicker cakey or foundations but the
texture of the cake eNOS of this one
still came through like it just looked
like I had makeup sitting on top of my
skin overall don't like the formula this
one these last two are really easy for
me to rank because I feel like they've
been at the bottom this whole time but
this is the Dior skin forever undercover
again I didn't buy the full size in this
one and I'm really really glad I didn't
because I really don't like this
foundation the big thing I don't like
about this is that it just comes off
your face if you guys saw it in the
check in at the end of the night I had a
literal like handprint where you could
literally see a distinct line from where
my hand was resting on my face it
literally looked like if you took like a
makeup wipe and wiped off part of my
foundation that's what it looks like
that aside it just looks heavy it clings
like this is one that just makes my skin
look really old it settles into my lines
I definitely would not recommend this
for more mature skin if you have any
kind of lines or anything this one is
just gonna stick in there it's very dry
this is a matte foundation so between
these two I would reach for this one
over this one for sure I also don't love
how fragrance this is do our foundations
are always very fragrance but if you
have sensitive skin just be aware of
that alright it's the worst foundation
out of 15 during the series in my
opinion is the Rimmel lasting finish 25
hour breathable foundation this is like
definition of a pointless foundation now
that I don't have nearly as much to
cover up on my skin I have no problem
with lighter coverage foundations if
they look like skin if foundation like
this has shear this is very sheer
coverage if the foundation has such
light coverage like this but looks like
makeup then there is literally no point
in my opinion to wear this or buy this
because you might as well just not wear
makeup or wear something that looks like
skin but that has lighter coverage
I love the applicator on this the
applicator is this is something special
there's something about this that feels
so nice and soft going on but the actual
product sucks there are so much better
sheer tinted moisturizer kind of
products that will give you the same
kind of coverage but that look so much
better on the skin jus a skin tint is
the one that comes to mind a bunch of
you said that you do think they replace
this for the red top one which I'm so
bummed about because the lasting finish
with the red top is fifty billion times
better than this one it has great
coverage it looks beautiful it has like
a gel like finish it just is like a
whole other ballgame so if they really
did replace this with that then that's a
huge huge downgrade right so those are
all 15 foundations from this series
ranked I'm excited that we had a couple
that are like stand out good but we
definitely had a lot of crappy ones too
if you love one of the ones that ranked
low then that's great we all have
different opinions I'm glad it worked
out for you these are just my
experiences with foundations on my skin
