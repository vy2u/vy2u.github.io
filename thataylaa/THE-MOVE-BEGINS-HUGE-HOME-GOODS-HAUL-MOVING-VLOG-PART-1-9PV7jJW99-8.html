pick out a freaking map right away
alright so it is Saturday July 11th I've
had a rough start to the day woke up
with migraine few hours later was ready
to roll went to film an apartment to her
and then rushed my memory card at home
just went back home to get the memory
card and then smashed my foot in the
door in my car so today it's an awesome
I'm gonna go get a burrito to make it
more awesome I brought my own taco sauce
because that's what dedicated burrito
eaters do this is El Paso and this is
the healthy new one and it's
amazing if you can find this at your
local grocery store get it but anyways
just lots of moving stuff is happening
today and I thought I'd vlog I'm
actually gonna be going up to Linwood
right now which is like a half hour away
from Seattle I think hopefully it's not
more than that they have a more
furniture up there and I really need to
find a couch I've been looking for like
two weeks online and I'm not not having
anything look I'm also gonna stop by the
home goods up there and see what we can
find
so I'll try and blog as much as I can
but I'm gonna go get a burrito
hallelujah it's only 65 degrees today
it's been like 90 everyday so I thought
this weekend was gonna be hell moving
but it's not that bad that water tastes
really old hell yeah by the way I got a
snapchat and I freaking love it I don't
know how I didn't do this before I'm
following a bunch of you guys just
really cool being able to see your
guys's faces and like what's going on in
your life I don't know it's just really
cool
all right so we are back I'm in the
apartment there's about super-bright I
just realized there's only one light in
the living room area which is kind of
strange so it's super shitty lighting so
I'm gonna attempt to film a little bit
in the bathroom because it's actually
pretty good lighting the bathroom I'm
freakin good this thing right there we
go back in the apartment I just did like
10 trips up and down from my car and
actually got a good amount of stuff
moved over I think we're just gonna show
you guys a hole I'm like should thing
right now it's super dark in the living
room because that is the only light that
we have so like I said I went to home
good and Ross and I went a little bit a
little bit crazy so a lot of stuff I'm
gonna show you guys is actually for this
corner I'm gonna be putting in either a
light gray corner piece that I found
from Target online that's like a wood
and really cool looking thing board the
typical like IKEA you know what I'm
talking about with the glass shelves
basically got a ton of stuff for that
the way that our apartment is I'm pretty
sure like everyone in this corridor can
hear me right now so hey guys I think
we're just gonna set up right here
alright so I think we're going to start
with confidence like 90% stuff like I
was from home bits let's start with this
even my freaking obsessed with it I saw
these of rose gold wire little things I
got one of these this was $12.99 I also
found the basket version well this is
semi which I'm obsessed with because
like a like face plant or a real plant
fulfilled adventurous in your try them
mister with one of the big dance that
was like fifty dollars let it get it but
those are really cute so all the little
storage been things I'm about to show
you I'm going to be putting on that
shelf yeah I just talked about but this
is also for that just like a decorative
steel kind of thing I'm going for like a
mid-century modern what in a rustic
industrial thing matter no it's like my
style has changed a lot it was wholly
yours alright let's just get company so
the basket version was 14.99 another
little weird decorative thing that I
thought like the shelves this is so cool
this is like a black and silver blacks
kind of thing I thought this would be
cool on that shelf or just on our like
coffee table or side table or something
this is just awesome and I think it was
like super cheap yeah $12.99 for cool
strange blessed thing how can we say
how's that then I got this studded
wooden gray thing that has cool storage
I don't know if we're going to put this
either on our coffee table or just maybe
on the dining room table
I don't know we'll see I just liked it
we'll figure out what to do with it
after this was $14.99 by the way
coconuts was literally like Disneyland
and I'm like everyone goes free gain
another storage crate thing since I
don't have too much storage space in my
room and I have a ton of stuff I'm
basically gonna be using as much a
little living room as I can because my
roommate doesn't have that much stuff so
I thought these
the boxes would be good to store later I
put my nail polish or something in your
honor but another one of those infamous
like weight restored weathered whether
wooden this was that night nine two of
these which I love this will go great
with the couch this is like pretty much
the exact same color as our couch this
will be super get storage I got two of
these these are each $9.99 then I got
this laptop desk you know the best way
to appreciate any spray-painting the
legs rose bold I feel like gotta look
really cool with this colored wood you
can change it so if you're writing
something or using your iPad or
something on your lap you can angle it
upward so you have to like strain your
neck looking down this was 1699
and this was a lot cheaper and a lot of
the laptop that laptop desk I found
online I love the wood block out this it
also holds up so you can store it away
have a whole basket of stuff here got
this gray just a throw blanket for the
couch it's like the texture of this good
tip if you look at the sheet section a
lot of the times they have throw
blankets ournament there that are about
a fifth of the price all the throw bling
of this hour like fifty dollars and this
was 1699 I've got a couple frames
I will different gray wooden frames I
have a bunch of frames from her whole
place both of these were $5.99 God just
a toothbrush holder nothing super
exciting this is
ference for 450 and then a shower
oh god this is for bathroom storage the
only downside to this apartment so far
besides a missing light in here is that
the bathroom has absolutely zero storage
and zero counter space it doesn't even
have that sink that has the cabinets
underneath there's literally nowhere to
put anything
so I got this little thing to just stand
up this is 20 bucks such a house for
this but whatever I think that retails
is from Ross all right moving on to Ross
that wasn't you planning on going into
Ross as I was already out there you
can't say how it works I cannot believe
I found this I've had a really good luck
finding a marble stuff rocks lately I am
a big old white marble gray trend I
don't know if I mentioned it on snapchat
or in a flaw but I got a cutting board
from Ross for $5 in the same exact
marble but you guys to see this because
it's freaking beautiful it's super heavy
like feels like really good quality
6:49 genuine marble up of new teakettle
I got this bat drag it literally took me
like a half hour to pick out a freakin
bathroom why why this will probably get
super dirty and I'll probably be buying
a new one in a few months
this was $12.99 and it was made by no
pocket if you're not aware of Mohawk
they make flooring and they're a legit
company so when I saw that I figured
let's do it we're getting to the end
Test Kitchen and I thought this would go
really well on our kitchen because it's
black and tan and gray which is like
what's going on in the kitchen five
bucks or something last thing which I am
super stoked about this was a total
score this was from Ross it looks like
it is like super high-quality woods this
is basically a side table for our
couches there was no price tag on this
and the guide totally I think rung it up
wrong and only rang up as $34 so how
yeah I've got a side table for $34 and I
love it and I'm super stoked about it
yeah that was my shopping extravaganza
I'm starting to like put stuff away and
buy put stuff away I mean like hang
towels that's it so I am just going to
start putting stuff away I think it's
like 8 p.m. right now or 7 p.m. I have
no freaking idea I want to get a ton of
packing done today because the couch
people come on Monday and the movers
come on Monday so I just want to get
things like put away I'm also gonna film
a apartment tour right now well it's
empty I'll link it down below or you can
click the I in one of these corners and
I'll take you directly to that video so
it is now the next day Sunday literally
a hot mess right now today has by far
been the worst packing moving day I
think I underestimated the amount of
stuff I had left to do I woke up at 8:30
a.m. today got shellacked done for my
trip because priorities and then I've
literally been packing attempting to get
my together also packing for
Atlanta and for my trip after Atlanta so
it's been kind of interesting this room
is a mess right now but this was all
covered in makeup before I basically
have 3 videos I have to record before I
leave aka in one day kind of tried to
plan out the tutorials and stuff I've
been posting a lot on snapchat today so
I feel like I already vlog but I just
realized I didn't even turn on my camera
today this room is a hot freaking mess
right now ugly all clothes that I have
to figure out I'm bringing it to Atlanta
or what's going on with it stuff
everywhere so this room needs a lot of
work but I did manage to disassemble my
bed by myself that was exciting whipped
out the drill we got it done here's my
mattress chillin these are all moving
boxes more moving boxes over here these
are all makeup embarrassing in the
middle of all this I'm trying to do
laundry and clean my sheets it is gonna
feel so frickin good to shower and wash
my hair today you just got Starbucks
