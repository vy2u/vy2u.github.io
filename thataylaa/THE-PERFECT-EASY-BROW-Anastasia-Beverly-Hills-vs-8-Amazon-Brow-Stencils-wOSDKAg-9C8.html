if this is just a sign 82 workout more
what but this is exhausting
all right so today I'm putting to the
test two different brows and sole
product one is high-end by anastasia
beverly hills and the other is from
amazon if there is one thing in life
I despise doing more than folding
laundry it is brows I love the way a
nice brow looks
I can appreciate brows I just do not
like doing them on myself I feel like
it's one the most frustrating things
with makeup I go through brow phrases
where I feel like my brows look really
good and then I go through phases where
I just can't get the shape right or like
one is totally different than the other
which I feel like happens to a lot of
people I'm definitely not perfect at
brows which is why I want to try
stencils there's hope for the brow
haters of the internet so in one of my
recent videos I was talking about how
much I hate brows what's new definitely
Nicole on YouTube commented and told me
that I needed to try these out so when
Stephanie tells me I need something I
absolutely love her videos she does like
top-notch reviews if you haven't checked
her out I'm going to link her down below
so that's kind of where this video idea
started from and then I was like you
know what let's try and see if we can
find dupes for them since this is a
little bit pricey for a stencil so I'm
doing a full on trying these guys on
without foundation trying them on with
foundation comparing them so you guys
will see how they work and if one is
better than the other if you have never
heard of or seen brows stencils they're
basically exactly what they sound like
they're stencils that you put on your
face and then you fill in your brows and
supposedly they give you you know a
shape and you don't have to like
freehand it so it's a Nastasia kit you
get five different stencil shapes in
here and it retails for $20 so four
dollars a stencil pretty pricey I really
like the packaging on here it's very
slim very classy on the other hand
Amazon you get a little plastic bag I'm
going to be linking both of these down
below but the Amazon Web by the brand
new luxe now retails for $7.99 free
shipping get 24 different stencils in
here is write that down price percent so
it's about 33 cents per stencil so 33
cents $4 24 in here you obviously get a
lot more options than just having five
shapes you see that they have these
exact ones on Walmart for 598 I don't
think you get free shipping on there
with the shipping it might end up being
more than the Amazon price so if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up I hope you guys
enjoy it let's jump into the application
and see how they go
I make a bond clearly but I don't have
any brow products on right now and I
just have concealer on my face since I
have a feeling we're going to be like
wiping off the brows and trying a few
those of you don't know I do have micro
bladed brows I have a whole video on it
which I love when I'm not wearing a full
face of makeup which hasn't been super
frequently lately I'll just put on
concealer like this and call today so
and I don't have foundation kind of
covering them up it's really nice to
just have micro bladed brows on if
you're someone who does not want to mess
with brows on a daily basis but since it
is just pigment there's not actual hair
there when I put on my foundation all
the times it can kind of cover up my
brow so that's usually why I go back and
with products you'll add a little bit of
shape so I think what I'm going to do is
play around with the different shapes to
figure out which one I want well I have
a bare face on so I can kind of wipe
them off and then once I have one I'll
put my foundation so it kind of covers
up my brows a little bit more and we can
actually put on the shape I know I can
technically go in with makeup remover to
get the foundation off my brows and then
I'll have permanent as on but I still
like to add a little bit of product just
what I like to do so since there are
only five options in the Anastacio kit I
think I'm going to go in with this first
to try and find a shape I like and I'm
kind of match it to the Amazon one first
we have the petite arch oh wait oh just
love it too early okay this looks
exactly like my brow shape like it's
literally lining up to be exactly my
brow on little stencils they have it
March let me try the medium arch and you
feel pretty nice quality plastic and
bend them and awesome like snap and half
or anything which is good because when
you're putting it against your face you
do need to kind of curb it to your face
medium arch over here ooh whoa that one
goes out pretty far on my face tail ends
right where my pointer finger is right
here that looks like it's going to add a
little bit more shine on try that one
tenders are petite arch and medium arch
so far let's try high arch so this one
is definitely large and in charge like
it's adding quite a bit to the top of my
brow whoa just kidding this guy is large
and in charge my face I definitely could
not pull off full arch that's like
adding a second brow to my brow but if
you're someone who likes bigger brows or
you have kind of like a bigger face
shape that one might work for you out of
the Anastacio ones the two that I would
go in with are either petite arch or
medium arch depending on what kind of
brows wanted again
the Ark is like exactly my brow shape
before we go in with the Amazon one I'm
going to go ahead and do this it would
be cool if there was kind of like a
sticky thing so it could just stick to
your face while you're putting it on
special brow products I'm going to be
using is the Mac past Twilight fluid
line this is what I've been using the
past I would say like months now super
similar to an associative brow or gel
makes a good barrel pomade that's from
the drugstore is a gel product
technically not for your brows but I
love it for my brows and then the brush
I use is the Engel at 31 t angled brush
we're doing this brow time I'm trying to
kind of line this up to where I already
have my brow on I have it starting right
where my brow already start but looks
like it's going to add quite a bit to
the top here and then also down here and
the tail like we're going to have a very
intense tail this is the medium arch you
stay in my shirt bro thanks kind of an
awkward angle okay so I'm going to start
down here so that most pigment is in the
center of my brow you're like I'm
coloring right now okay my left arm
holding this thing up is already sore so
you get an arm workout and a brow
stencil two and one okay wait why is
there a little am I supposed to pop it
out there's like a little piece of
plastic right in the middle and all the
stencils on these there's a little piece
of plastic so okay I guess you just have
to go back in and fill that in
afterwards once you take the stencil off
is that plastic or am I supposed to be
down there I'm supposed to be in there
well I guess I'll bring this all the way
down where does a stop this is hard to
see my left arm is like about so oh man
this tails going to be intense I have to
be careful not to let it slide down
while you're doing this and like hold it
in shape or else your brows going to be
kind of funky but I'm going to go in
lightly just in the front and kind of
feather it up if sink I have it on where
I need to have it on my arm is so sore
I'm going to take this off that's
actually a lot better than I was
thinking this is going to turn out still
need to fill in certain parts like
especially where that weird piece of
plastic is right in the center to
definitely help you can see where I drew
on on the plastic like that would have
been on my face I'm just going to go in
and follow that line a little bit cool
because it also kind of gives you a
guide so like I can see exactly where I
need to fill and now the tail is
definitely funky like the tail is way
too long for my face shape and also too
thick I don't give you a full on point
kind of like a curved tail which I'm not
a fan of when I actually do my brows I'm
going to go and with concealer to clean
it up I just want to show you guys the
general shapes we can decide which one
to go with I'm not going to try the
petite arch because it looks exactly
like my brow shape so let's try out
these Amazon guys I have 24 options
that's a lot of bro options cool than me
that I almost feel like with this one as
I'm looking at it more I would use it
for the front part and then just do the
tail on my own I don't even know where
to start so slightly overwhelming I'm
just going to go like process of
elimination just looking at them the
ones I know I definitely won't want this
looks like a up tadpole probably
gonna be hard for you guys to see but
what the heck is going on here g2 is a
No what the heck is this one this one is
like big in all the wrong places the
tail is huge that's a no this is a three
plastic on these is definitely crappier
quality you can see how bendy these are
like I feel like I could bend this in
half I definitely aren't cut as precise
and all the ones I've looked at so far
it's not like a smooth cut it has like a
weird bump so I'm going to put that one
on the side that's H - that's a
contender see - it's just a straight
line f2 is just straight-up effed up
what you guys got to see this one
oh wait B - might be even better what is
that you - looks like a twig you would
find in your yard this is exactly what I
want the front of my brow to look like
each one is like if you want the front
of your brow to come down to your nose
f1 is for those who have a 90s brow
still going on you want messed up d1 is
very very art G is what d1 looks like
again still bumpy in some weird places
f3 looks kind of similar to the petit
arch so this one actually lines up
perfectly to my brow let's see how
similar this is to the Anastacio petit
art show this is really hard to show on
camera since these are freaking clear
pieces of plastic but it lines up pretty
closely the Amazon one goes down a
little bit further on the tail front is
just kind of oddly shaped for the most
part that's probably the most similar
you'll find with the Chi arch of f3 d3
is very similar to my eyebrow shape
right now as well and this last one is
again like a hotdog brow so out of all
24 of those I think there's three
possible that could work F 3 H 2 and D 3
I want to try H 2 so there's a line in
the front
on both which you're supposed to line up
with the inner corner of your eye
Anastasio one does have three kind of
guidelines and the Amazon one only has
one so you can just have to figure
out on your own with the Amazon one as
far as like how to hold it and where to
angle it I guess I should have explained
this this one you're supposed to
basically line up the front so that it
follows your inner corner that line and
then the last line right here if you
take something straight
it should basically line up with the
corner of your nose so if you do a
diagonal line that's the line that you'd
want to follow if you really need help
drawing on your brows it probably is
easier to have the three guidelines
let's go to town
hopefully my arm will survive this one I
do feel like you have to hold more like
you really got to get the bottom and the
top at the same time I need like a third
arm right now because the plastic just
wants to go up so again I'm going to
start in the center just to concentrate
most of the products there I can already
tell this tail is going to be
interesting I don't know if this is just
a sign I need to work out more what but
this is exhausting this one is
definitely harder you really have to
push it against your face and it's kind
of like sliding around this is this is
something try a different angle can't
even see since doing the tail the tail
has already moved so it's really hard to
keep this one in the same place we're
tuned again not as bad as I thought when
I was putting it on I almost like the
arch and the shape overall better on
this one even though it was way harder
to actually apply the tail needs some
work also here's to see how putting
these on top of foundation will work I
feel like this is going to like rub off
some of my foundation because you really
have to like hold it against your skin
and push it there I have black stuff all
over my hands from my temporary roots
gray stuff I am leaving my house after
this video so I can't just do like one
brow on each with the foundation on so I
think I'm actually going to do the
Amazon one just because I like the shape
of this one a little bit better right so
my foundations on I do have a little bit
of self tanners still left over on right
now so I use the LA girl Pro coverage HD
foundation the shade porcelain which is
normally too dark did my under-eye
concealer powder everything so let's go
in to test out the brows so as you can
see when I put my foundation on it does
cover up some of my brows especially
like on the top here where I one
foundation over again there are ways to
avoid that I would just
or go back in with brow products that's
good because now I feel like we'll
really be able to see how it does the
shape so it was h2 I'm assuming you want
to wipe these off in between uses just
so you don't get any of that product on
your face that's on the stencil
hopefully this isn't an utter disaster
because I need to be out of my house in
like an hour I feel like this is going
to totally rub off my foundations I
don't like this so I'm just going to do
the first portion and try and not press
super hard so it doesn't rub off my
foundation and a hard not to though
because you have to line it up against
your skin so you're not going under the
stencil I'm going to leave the tail
portion because it is like going places
at my tail on my real brows not going
I'm going to take this thing off
Foundation definitely came off on the
brow stencil a little bit when they need
to touch that up with concealer but
doesn't look horrible like it didn't
totally rub off my foundation gave me a
nice little shape but I need to clean
that up because my tails like going up
here and then I'm just going to have to
freestyle the tail not bad at all I
actually really like the way that that
looks now that I did my own tail I can
tell this is like more stressful or less
stressful than just freestyling your own
brow okay and also now I really got to
line up my brows to make sure that these
are going to look semi even it was kind
of hard okay this takes way too much
concentration top at the same time I
feel like that one did not turn out as
well probably this side and angle
depending on if you're a righty or lefty
also influences it being a righty this
is probably going to be easier for me
than going this way and going right
against the stencils that make sense
that one definitely doesn't look as good
think I have the shape even enough to
where I can go in with concealer now to
carve them out so I'm going to do that
alright so the rest of my makeup son I'm
going to give you guys my final sauce
super quick so you guys know Milani
matte naked lipstick I added Tarte party
blush offense be my highlight and then
my contour is this staff which is from
Amazon I did a full video testing weird
Amazon products and then my eyes which I
already had on obviously was the BH
Cosmetics essential eyes 28 color
eyeshadow palette so everything on my
face will be linked down below like
always so my thoughts on the brows
dentals the more I've had them on and as
I was like doing the rest of my makeup I
did a couple snaps took a few photos
they look really good I do
like they look better than normal okay
this one's definitely higher knots I'm
looking at it or maybe it's just my baby
open I can tell but I think as far as
the actual shape they do look better I
don't know you guys are the brow experts
let me know what you think down below do
these looks better than my normal brows
it look worse if you're going for
quality I would say the Anastacio ones
because it is much nicer you get the
better material you get the lines if
your time is out for fun you just want
to spend a few dollars on it I think it
could be worth trying out the Amazon
ones I do want to reiterate that there
are a lot of completely messed up brow
shapes on here I think out of all 24
there's maybe like three or four that
actually look decent and don't have
weird like wobbly lines on them but
either way it is kind of more like a
guide and you'll probably still have to
go in and fill it in a little bit more
after you take it off your face so I
think both the anastacio and the Amazon
could work depending on what you're
looking for what I use these on a daily
basis I don't know we'll see I do like
how my brows look right now I think if I
got the hang of it and could like make
them look more symmetrical I might
really like using these I don't like how
it kind of takes off my foundation of
course you could apply these before your
foundation but I personally hate
blending foundation around eyebrows
that's why I never do my brows first
obviously the Amazon ones were workable
so I don't think these are a total
thumbs down or anything I definitely
have their downsides but if you're
willing to make them work they can work
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and found it helpful if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up let me know
down below if there are any other Amazon
products you guys want me to try out if
you're new here you can join the BAE
reto family and subscribe I upload
