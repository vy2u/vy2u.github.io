one of these moments where I was staring
at the microwave while my mac and cheese
was cooking and I felt like I had to
film a video right now and now we are
here
and yes I managed to burn my microwave
bowl of mac and cheese so this is a
completely impromptu video I just got
off work there on some red lipstick and
now we're here so before we get started
I should probably address the fact that
yes we are in a new location this is my
new filming room situation or whatever
you want to call it I think I'm gonna
wallpaper the walls and this will
probably be white right whoa a white rug
so this is not what the background is
gonna look like I'm just still moving in
if you want to see how I'm decorating my
room and moving in and everything I do
have room blogs which have a link over
here and they will open in a new video
if you want to watch those so I've had
my Mimi box sitting in the corner of
this room this whole time so I thought
today would be a good moment to open it
and see what's inside
so I've done a couple media box and
boxing videos and you guys seem to like
them it's basically a Korean beauty box
service and all the info and then will
be down below it's not a subscription
you don't have to commit I love it I've
been really happy with some of the stuff
I received in these boxes so far a
couple of them are in my last race and
rejects video since they are sending me
these they do send like really random
ask boxes I got like the whole-wheat box
and the skincare box and I think this
time I got the global box that's what it
said in the email so I'm super excited
to see what's in here
what are global things ok so yes I have
Mimi Vox global number 13 and there's
always coupon codes in the downbar if
you want to check out Mimi box we're
gonna go buy whatever I pull out first
is this soy bio + it says this is
supposed to prevent the formation of
fine lines and wrinkles apply two to
three drops and just Pat it into your
skin so it's supposed to help with
wrinkles and brightening and say
and it looks like there's two little
bottles in here I don't these are
different things it looks like they're
the same thing and they're just too
little any dropper things and that looks
like there's a CC cream which I'm super
excited about I've never tried a CC
cream I have had really shitty luck with
BB creams though there's something in BB
creams that like horribly break out my
skin took my skin a good like month to
recover from the Maybelline BB cream
just open this this is the thing this is
called Sun based color control cream it
has SPF 50 it looks like it's supposed
to be whitening and has wrinkle
improvement and there's a pump
hallelujah we love our pumps this
retails for $54 holy I wonder if
this is gonna be light enough Korean BB
creams are usually a lot lighter than
American BB creams let's see what closes
any day now come on man whoa it looks
like white I don't know if I just didn't
shake that up you guys see that Oh weird
so once you like rub it in the color
appears I wonder if this is supposed to
be like skin tone adjusting it smells
really good it smells like some kind of
like lotion you get the spa does I go to
the spa so often feels really light on
my skin but it actually covered like all
of my hand freckles and things ooh
and we got some volume I think these are
tampons wow they have a very visual
diagram in case you don't know how to
put a tampon in all this is in Korean
and let's read about tampons because we
you don't know anything about them it's
made from 100% purely organic cotton
okay well I guess that would be kind of
cool to see how they compared to
American tampons if you guys that
there's on that one what is this this
looks interesting
so this retails for $48 so it looks like
this is some kind of face cream has all
these like organic wheat bud extracts
and super classy packaging for see
how this thing smells ooh
oh man I don't think I've ever smelled
something
this I am at a loss for words it smells
a little bit better when you rub it into
your skin now it smells like something
it feels super lightweight almost a
little bit greasy yeah it definitely
feels a little bit greasy
ooh very greasy I don't know if I'm
putting that on my face if nothing else
I might clean out the jar so I have a
derma scalp shampoo so this is supposed
to deep cleanse your scalp remove any
excess things you got going on refresh
to a tea tree oil oh it probably smells
really good smells very minty and tea
tree ish I'm excited to use this and
there's this thing this is basically a
sunblock that has SPF 42 well I think
it's orange how does this like peach
color to it oh god I don't know I don't
know I feel about this one alright so
the last thing in the Box is this big
long thing all right guys this one
sounds interesting I don't think I can
even stun this up sommes that rate it
made from carbonated water this carboxy
Pat creates sparkling bubbles on your
face it may prickle a little bit as the
bubbles penetrate deep into the skin I
guess it's kind of a mask maybe I'll use
this in like a blog this is like a whole
contraption
holy not gonna lie this is like
really intimidating what the is
this you guys this is the optimal
thumbnail time all right call me down
Bluff you want to see that blog
so is everything that was in that Mimi
box there are I should ton a different
kind of Mimi boxes that are makeup one
skincare ones hair ones I think tons of
different boxes for whatever you're into
if I was purchasing these on my own I
probably wouldn't opt for like something
like this I am really stoked about the
BB cream or CC cream whatever it is and
then this shampoo oh I think that's it
quick update I don't know when this
video will be up but I have two vlogs
coming I have in a harming vlog and a
vlogger fair vlog coming and I'm trying
to like throw in videos in between those
so it's not just like all blogs all the
sudden randomly I will have some
exciting shouting news videos coming up
I have some cool products that I'm
excited to use in
videos if you're wondering my necklace
is from Etsy store is called layered and
long but this is so freaking beautiful
the lady was so sweet you can custom
make like whatever layers you want it is
kind of obsessed with it and I think
it's so pretty if you like this video
