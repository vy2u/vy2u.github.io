whole experience there's nothing quite
like a successful thrift trip to get
your adrenaline going
am i right sweater was not the greatest
choice right now there's like 95 degrees
in here so as per usual I went down
YouTube wormhole and started watching a
 ton of thrift haul videos and I got
so in the mood to go thrifting for those
of you who've been watching my channel
for years you know I used to go
thrifting hardcore multiple times a week
I was in it to win it in college that's
all Rach and I my best friend used to do
literally we would drink the rest and go
to class I haven't been thrifting in a
hot minute and I forgot how damn good it
feels the thrift stores where I went to
college were unreal now that I'm in
Seattle they're not quite up to par
there's a couple good thrift stores here
but for the most part they're pretty
overpriced and it's really hit or miss
which I guess is like any thrift shop
sometimes you have a good day sometimes
you don't but that's kind of the fun of
it right the region I hit up goodwill
and Ballard and also Value Village Inn I
didn't know what area that technically
is Google I was having a good day stars
aligned so much good stuff so I'm going
to show you guys everything I got I did
try everything on so you can see I'm
gonna start out with Value Village
here's my bag don't ask me why I got two
sweaters because we're approaching
summer here start with this one so
Valley Village was half off everything
all clothing was half off so all the
stuff I'm showing you from Valley
Village I got for a total of $24 which
when you see how much I got unreal my
heart's racing just reliving this whole
experience so this is the brand 14th in
Union it was $5.99 and then I got it for
half off two three bucks it has a super
cute kind of cutout in the back and it's
just a really loose flowy sweater kind
of like 3/4 sleeves or almost like a
long short sleeve on me I feel like this
would look really cute for spring with
like ripped denim capris and flats or
even like ankle boots or you could also
wear this in the fall with like a scarf
and jean jacket but doesn't feel too
warm it's not itchy at all it's a really
nice kind of sweater material I'm all
about the black and white life so next
is this hideous green sweater that I'm
wearing right now that I love feel like
it's an ugly green but it's one the ugly
Green's that kind of works hopefully
this one is warm this is definitely more
like a false letter I don't know if I
could wear this one in the summer and I
wasn't thinking about it because I'm
dying under these lights as it is right
now and it's not scratchy it's just
really cozy I like that you can wear it
off the shoulder it just fits really
cute it's cozy and this was how
much was this this was eight dollars so
I got it for four bucks next is this
romper this was a fricken score because
this is the silence and noise brand
which you can get at Urban Outfitters I
believe and it's a super pretty muted
almost like sky-blue teal color
rompers I can usually never wear because
I look like a five-year-old
I'm on the more petite side I'm 411 so
if I find a romper it has to be really
fitted up here which this one is so it
doesn't make me look like a total bag
and also the thing I like is it has
almost like a skirt bottom to it where
the shorts are super flowy so you almost
can't tell it's a romper it almost just
looks like a mini dress or something has
this really cute crossover back this was
$15.99 I don't know if I would have paid
that full prices wasn't half off so like
that's priced really high for the thrift
store so I got it for $8 which I feel
like is a really good deal this one
isn't for me but my roommates obsessed
with Trader Joe's and we're convinced
that she's going to meet her future
husband there so I got her at Trader
Joe's t-shirt it looks pretty new like
this I don't even know if this has ever
been worn it might have been washed like
one time but it looks really new the
color is still super vibrant and this
was 149 half off so I felt like I was
obligated to get it I figured she could
crop this or wear it as a sleep shirt
whatever nice I got this light pink
almost tans like a really muted light
pink spaghetti-strap dress this is
actually from forever 21 so this was
$5.99 so I got it for $3 $3 dress I mean
come on probably going to wear this with
a jean jacket and some ankle boots or
you could wear this with a leather
jacket and like heels if you're going
out or something so it's super long
flowy I might also belt this one just so
it's a little bit more flattering I
think this is one of my favorite things
I found because I can never find shoes
at the thrift store I'm a size that
women's 4 so I typically can only shop
at Nordstrom Rack because that's when
the only places to carry size fours
these say that they're size 5 but they
completely fit these are adorable they
look brand-new pretty much there were
949 I think the shoes were also half off
so I'm pretty sure I got these for about
five bucks I was just staring at my feet
for five minutes when I tried to done in
shock that they actually fit because I
never can find shoes that actually fit
me I was everything from Valley Village
let's
move on to Goodwill shorts are one of
those things that I feel like are really
hard for me to find a pair that fits
well don't ask me how but I managed to
find three pairs of pants that actually
fit me two of them are shorts ones a
pair of jeans that I'm going to cut into
shorts but the first is this gap pair it
says they're slim cut off these are what
I'm wearing when I'm trying on most of
the shirts that you guys will see from
Goodwill if you're not on the shorter
side these probably wouldn't be
high-waisted but on me they're kind of
high-waisted feel like they're kind of
the perfect amount where it doesn't
totally cut off my torso I love the way
gap jeans feel they just feel like
really good thick denim and these were
$4.99 goodwill wasn't having any kind of
sales so I just paid whatever the price
was on the tags the next pair of shorts
I got are actually guess like what the
heck
ripped Jean shorts from guess I feel
like this color can sometimes look a
little bit cheesy it has to be paired
with the right kind of shirt but I just
love the rips on these they fit good and
these were 997 see if they actually like
as jeans too but the bottoms aren't my
favorite these were tight around the
ankles I would just keep use as jeans
probably these are Levi's jeans that I'm
going to make into cutoff shorts I might
add some wrist on the front too because
I'm not a huge fan of the front of these
they're super you know I'm looking for
stripy
whatever I loved the back on these love
the dark blue Levi's design on the
pocket but this is the curvy cut Levi's
jeans and not sure if they still make
that style but if they do I'm definitely
going to try and because these ones at
me perfectly this one I didn't end up
picking up in the store I just got it
because it's a dollar ninety-nine you
know how it goes trying on turtlenecks
in stores when you have a full face of
makeup on when I just filmed the Tryon
for this video that was the first time I
was trying this on and I really liked it
I liked the cut I like the color of this
I like how it fits
I think tucked into jeans shorts it's
really cute two bucks it has ribbed
detailing on it and I'll have the belt
link down below that I'm trying these on
with it's just from Chien I believe
don't ask me why I got this it was just
calling my name this is a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's
t-shirt this looks brand-new I don't
think this has ever been worn or washed
I loved the grey sparkles on here and I
just thought this would be cute tucked
into denim shorts I might crop this or
tie it and just pair it with shorts or
wear it to the beach or wear it wherever
this was $4.99 I probably want to pay
that much if it wasn't brand new but it
looked really nice and it's really nice
quality this is one of my favorite finds
just because I feel like it's really
unique and I'm going to be wearing this
on 4th of July this year
it says hate has no home here and the
thing I really love is that
in a bunch of different languages Arabic
and Hebrew on here which I speak both
have used to speak forget like 90% of it
and I just saw this and I was instantly
into it and this shirt was $1.99 this
last top I didn't try on because I'm
doing like 10 loads of laundry right now
and all of my bra let's and sports bras
are in there I think I would pair this
with a bando underneath to have this tan
lacy kind of bra from Victoria Secret
that I might wear with this and then
just tuck it into jean shorts again you
can't go wrong this to me looked like
something you would find in Urban
Outfitters or something this forever 21
but it was only 399 so like this would
be perfect for summer so that was
everything I'm in a total suresh mode
now I'm like back in it addicted to it
so if you guys liked this video make
sure you give it a thumbs up let me know
down below if you want to see more
thrift hauls if you've never gone thrift
in just go on a day when you have
nowhere to be and you just can take the
time to look because you really do have
to kind of dig through stuff and try
things on but when you actually find
stuff it is so rewarding if you're in
the Washington area and you know of any
really good thrift stores let me know
where they are down below I'm gonna hit
them up if you're new here you can join
the baby toe family and subscribe I
