but gonna put it on my face today
all right so today we are going back in
time throwback makeup look I'm going to
be doing a full face and trying out a
bunch of products that either used to be
super hyped up from YouTube or just that
I used to reach for all the time I
actually have a whole video on products
that YouTube made me buy so I just
thought this would be fun to try out see
what I think them years later my
opinions change on them at all and maybe
just Rhian Speyer me to reach for some
of these products again so if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up you can follow me on
instagram snapchat what snapchat
Facebook Twitter all right here if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
alright so like I said a lot of these
products I mentioned in the YouTube made
me buy a video but this is the
maybelline baby skin primer I think even
though I hate this now I actually use
this for a while because I thought it
was good you know when you keep using
something because you're like everyone
else likes it felt must be good I think
back in the day that's alleged with this
this is a silicon primer but basically
it just is a little bit too slick for me
and makes me feel a bit oily so for
foundation I really wanted to use the
maybelline superstay foundation but they
discontinued that I can't find my old
bottle but that was definitely my go-to
foundation back in the day but a close
second is the Revlon Colorstay
foundation I actually have a more recent
review on this comparing the old formula
to the new formula which is this one
with the pump this is the shade 150
think maybe this will match me I'm just
using my normal brushes which will be
linked down below but the Sigma f80 I've
literally had since freshman year of
college so seven years ago now whoa
there's no way I've had this exact brush
for seven years so if that doesn't speak
to the quality of Sigma I don't know
what does so I'm just going to stipple
this foundation on thank you guys
actually might be seeing this video
before I film the second video today
this morning think this one will
actually be going up first but I'm on a
different camera right now it's just the
ad D instead of the 70d and way I'm
liking this better than I usually do
Canon 70d totally broken music and I
have the white balance settings
different right now I feel like it looks
a lot more true to color which is
exciting so usually my videos look kind
of blue because my walls are a weird
tint of white but at least in the
viewfinder it's looking a lot better
right now by the way if you've tried
this Sigma f80 and you didn't like it
the first few times for me this is going
to sound weird / kind of gross I have to
get it like slowly
coated in foundation before I like how
it applies I actually have a brand new
one that I was using yesterday and I get
way better coverage when I've used the
brush a few times I feel like that kind
of always happens with me like right
after I wash my brushes they don't apply
foundation quite as well I don't get
quite as much coverage I think because
the products like seeping into the brush
fit more rather than just sitting on top
of the brush so since you guys are
saying this I'm pretty sure on Monday
the videos you're seeing this week I
said I was pre filming for San Francisco
actually had to cancel the San Francisco
trip so I'm not going to San Francisco
anymore just too busy with work stuff
and everything so that is not happening
which is unfortunate but I think I'll be
there in July possibly I have like two
and a half almost three weeks of videos
pre-recorded so that feels great always
feels so good to be ahead on video so
I'm still like stressed out about it
really like anyways this one looks right
now I think it's actually a pretty
decent shade match for me right now one
of my favorite ever if not my favorite
drugstore concealer ever made was the
covergirl simply ageless 205 concealer
this shade they discontinued years ago
you could only find on eBay this is the
lightest shade and I'm pretty sure they
just completely discontinued this
concealer period still have some left
and I've been hoarding it but this is
definitely my throw back concealer this
is what I used for years and just so
good you know how I found this thing I
think I just randomly picked it up years
ago just has beautiful coverage it
doesn't crease horribly on me I really
wish they would bring this back because
this would be my like Holy Grail
drugstore concealer I'm really not into
the next HD concealer that one makes me
super dry and crazy
do you like the lavender Ward's got
way too much do you like the lavender
shade of it just for mixing as far as
the actual formula that one I'm not into
it's got way too much I'm just going to
highlight the center of my face with
this lash extension update they are
falling out my lashes are definitely a
bit shorter than they were before for
sure this is definitely my og setting
powder for underneath my eyes this is
the Physicians Formula translucent
correcting powders I still switch
between this one in my stargazer
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
powder this is in the shade 100 I've
clearly hit pan on this I haven't used
this in a long time just going to put
this on the center of my face I think I
will just put this everywhere why not
skin looks good right now I throw
brow products for me is Mac fluidline
and past Twilight I worked at Mac in
college he got this thing for free
actually recently that like in the past
couple weeks have been reaching for this
again technically a gel eyeliner but I
used it for years as a brow product and
literally almost out of it lately I've
been dreading doing my eyebrows like
more than usual so if anyone wants to
come over do my brows volunteer as
tribute
I kind just want someone else to do my
brows and like see how they would do the
shape and stuff because sometimes I
think I just need to try a totally
different shape or something this one is
always like the good child and this one
is just the one who's shut up
all the times when I think of the oldest
eye primer I use definitely Urban Decay
primer potion this is a new bottle so
they've changed the packaging so like I
might use this any years the thing I
don't like about this is that I feel
like it feels kind of greasy on my
eyelids and I also don't like how it's
sheer so it takes off any concealer that
I put on my eyelids which is why I like
the Mac Paint Pot because it gives you
that coverage on top of your eyelid like
this was one of those products that
there just weren't a whole lot of eye
primers on the market back then so it
was kind of like everyone's go-to my
lashes look janky right now I think
Nick's taupe black I knew tube inspired
contour purchase I'm going to be using
bronzer too so I think I'm going to use
this morphe 48 brush as a contour I like
to use this one if I just want more
chiseled contour then I use my one wild
brush to kind of blend it out and go in
with a bronzer on top of it this shade I
still think is a great contour if you
have more fair-skinned it's cool toned
but it doesn't look too Ashley and gray
would it be a throwback video without
benefit hoola bronzer they do make a who
a light shade now they have a whole
video on that but I'm using the original
hoola because we do not have hula light
back in the day times have changed so
this one is definitely not the best
shade for me I'm just gonna use a super
light hand because this can look orange
really quick on my skin tone yep
this is definitely one of those things
that I bought because everyone was
talking about it and it just doesn't
quite work for me but it looks really
great on people who have a little bit
darker skin tone if you can't tell by
how disgustingly worn this product is
my favorite blush shade of wet and wild
pearlescent pink this should definitely
be in the trash but I'm going to put it
on my face today a shade I still think
is beautiful I think they reformulated
these a bit to make them a little bit
less pigmented and more blendable
because this original formula you
literally just need to lightly tap your
blush in your blush your brush or else
you'll pick up too much product
highlighter you all can probably guess
mention this one in the YouTube made me
buy video but this is the mary lou
manizer highlighter by the ball and I
think this was my first highlighter that
I ever tried I have tried this again
fairly recently and I just don't love it
it totally emphasizes my texture I mean
this is super pretty glows you can see
but you can see all the texture on my
face right here which is why I never
really reach for this one it's a really
pretty tone it's almost like a light
champagne gold kind of color I just wish
it was a little bit smoother looking so
far I do my eye makeup I'm going to go
in with setting spray this is usually
when I apply setting spray just because
I don't like any of my mascara or
eyeliner or anything transferring and
getting weird
Scandinavia was the first ever setting
spray that I used they used to have
totally different packaging I think this
was the first like consumer brand
setting spray remember when there
weren't drugstore setting sprays I
remember when the L'Oreal setting spray
came out and it was like the best day
ever was a mister on this one is really
nice this is actually the oil control
version yeah dude I'm like in this
foundation moving on to eyes this is my
very well loved Urban Decay Naked
palette this is the original Naked
palette I just did a shadow and she was
using the new Urban Decay Naked heat
palette if you want to see that I'll put
it in I over here as you can see I've
gotten my youth out of some of these
looks like spin and half-baked have
definitely seen better days I don't
think I've actually used this palette in
years I still reach for my Urban Decay
Naked 2 palette but this was such a big
deal when this came out I'm gonna go on
to shade naked right here I'm really
curious to see what I think of this
palette now thank the Urban Decay Naked
3 was my least favorite palette that one
just totally underwhelming I feel like
the formula and those are not as great
either Urban Decay ultimate Naked basics
pellets my favorite since I've got the
gold jewelry on I think I'm going to do
like a gold smokey eye and I actually
really curious how many more naked
palettes Urban Decay is going to come
out with isn't it crazy how eventually
it'll probably be like an iPhone
27 some so over the top so I'm going to
take the shade buck which is like pretty
much the only yeah let's the only other
matte shade so guess I'm going with that
one I'm just going to put this into the
crease a little bit looks like I'm
getting a tiny bit of fallout the black
shade out here has some glitter in it
this is the shade creep I really want to
do like a super smoky eye so I think I'm
going to do it anyways no it's not matte
not that pigmented and also not blending
that easily yeah I really have to layer
this one up and kind of work with it
naked and buck we're fine crepe I'm not
into okay so I'm going to take
half-baked on my finger which is the
gold shade in here and just put that on
the center of my I guess like the first
half of my eye okay half-baked is still
super pretty yeah there's something
about this shade that is just gorgeous
blending out the edges a little bit I'm
gonna take Finn and just put that right
on my inner corner
the only shimmery semi light shade in
this palette version is more like a
satin but I think I'm going to pop a
little bit virgin on there too just to
brighten it up and I'm going to go back
in with a buck go back and with creep
and just put that on like the outer
third so I went in with a dark eyeliner
on the waterline I think it was a Revlon
one so it's going to go in with a black
eyeliner since I don't have that one
anymore have a thousand black liners
geez up I don't think I want to use
liner today because I have these ardell
lashes which are kind of like cat eye
ones ardell demi wispies are definitely
the first lashes I ever wore if I wasn't
wearing lashes which 99.9% of the time I
didn't I would use the L'Oreal
voluminous carbon black mascara this was
definitely a purchase inspired by I
think I heart makeup 92 and I still
really like this mascara I just like it
more for like layering I'm gonna go pop
on these lashes I freaking love these
lashes I need to wear these more and I
just say mad props to anyone who's mute
inted lash glue oh and my bobby pins is
out of my head how long has I've been
there probably the entire video no in my
look um yeah what the heck didn't lash
glue I'm completely out of my usual Holy
Grail lash glue which has since been
discontinued so I'm on the hunt for a
good lash glue I do not like the House
of lashes lastly let me know what your
favorites are down below bonus
the drugstores because I need to pick it
up like today the last step is lips I
think I've kind of two main products and
I think about lipstick I used to use
which is the MAC lipstick or the NYX
macaroon lipstick just because I'd have
such vivid memories when these things
launched and it was such a big deal on
youtube-land
actually have the white one here which
doesn't look like I've ever used so that
could be helpful to lighten up a
lipstick if you need to but I'm just
going to go in with Mac fleshpot Mac
creme denude is actually what I used to
use all the time that one is like kind
of a goner and totally melted and I
never really use lip liner alright so
this is the final look everything is on
my face so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know down below what your
throwback products are all the products
I used on my face will be down below if
