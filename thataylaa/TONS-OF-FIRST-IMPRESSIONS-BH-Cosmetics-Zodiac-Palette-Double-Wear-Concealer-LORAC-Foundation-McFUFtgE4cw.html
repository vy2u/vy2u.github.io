impressions on a bunch of new stuff some
of us just new to me other other bits
other things are new releases the star
of the show here today is the BH
Cosmetics zodiac palette this I was most
excited to try out today fairly new
eyeshadow released by BH Cosmetics and
I'm just a bunch of stuff a foundation
some highlighters contour it literally
looks like my head is floating when I do
that so if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the bay
Rito family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. sip time
why did I just clap like 10 times all I
did that all right I was gonna put on a
jacket but it's like 80 degrees in here
right now so we're just gonna roll with
having no body today it's really getting
toasty in here got my babydome ugh
Cheers so ready washed and moisturize my
face but I have a new primer here that I
want to try out this is by L'Oreal it's
their infallible glow lock illuminating
primer they also have a mattifying one
but I would not put anything matte on my
face right now with the dryness so I'm
gonna squeeze some oh it's like pink
there we go it is indeed salmon feels
like feels like a lotion my hands my
skin is freaking out from some product I
just started using I think because I was
like totally clear a week ago I wouldn't
say it's like the most glowy primer I've
ever tried I feel like my face lift a
little bit glow here before I put that
on it feels just kind of like a lotion
to me it just smells kind of like clean
it actually has a nice not too intense
scent have a new foundation I wanna try
and a new brush so the brush we're gonna
be using is the Real Techniques blend
and blur it look at this thing it's like
bigger than my face base all over face
neck and body application whoa this is
giant I don't know how you're supposed
to we'll find out
I'm gonna get that on one half and then
use the Sigma f80 3 on the other half
and if there's any areas that I can't
get with it so from foundation this
isn't a new product but I have never
tried it this is the lorac natural
performance foundation I actually got
this off of a hot look this is in the
shade MP 1 porcelain it's just like
North shamrocks flash sale sight I
always have a link down below it's bomb
I'm on there literally every day I check
it whoo look at
that that is a nice packaging right
there it says it can be applied lightly
for a sheer finish or layered for fuller
coverage you know weird about the layer
this what would they weren't kidding
when they said sheer could be the brush
which is why we're gonna do half my face
within my normal brush no makeup makeup
kind of days this could be nice because
it's kind of just cancelling out some of
the redness but it still just looks like
a tinted moisturizer you can't really
see it on your face and it gives a nice
glow I'm curious to see what it looks
like on the other side this brush just
ate up like a lot of that that was a big
pump and that just soaked it all up
there's something about these oval
brushes I'm just not down with I feel
like they're just kind of a pain in the
ass why why I don't want a brush the
sides of my face the other thing with
those brushes is that you can't really
stipple it you kind of have to work it
in which automatically takes away some
of the coverage like if I did that with
this brush it would give me less
coverage it looks really natural and I
love the glowy kind of finish I've been
on this side we're getting I would say
maybe medium coverage closer to light
coverage I'm just gonna conceal my acne
down on my neck right now cuz there's a
lot going on kind of want to go dampen a
sponge to see if I can build this up
because I really like how this is
looking on how it's sitting on my skin I
just need a little bit more coverage I
mean if I was just wearing this to wear
on like a natural day like I said oh
just bought conceal but I just want to
see how much we can build it up let's
try and layer this a little bit whoo
this is sitting on my skin beautifully
look at that that's totally buildable
when I can be able to do a where tests
in this video because it's already it's
seven o'clock right now but I'll update
you guys in the description box because
I'll have time to try this out this
video is pre-recorded a couple weeks
dude this looks beautiful why isn't no
one talking about this it has that nice
like beige tone to it that I love I'm
into this my forehead looks beautiful it
has that like dewy plumping kind of look
it's not clinging anywhere and I have
some dryness right now I'm excited that
was off to a good start
wouldn't use the brush again but like
the foundation a lot though this
concealer I mentioned in the Sephora
Ulta haul video a while ago and I have
resisted I've held off until now to use
it in first impressions video so this is
the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place concealer this is in the lightest
shade one and extra light neutral it
smells like I stay water so let's go
ahead and do this under the eyes and I'm
also gonna whoa this is yellow let's try
my morphe g 3801 size what i usually use
and then maybe finger or sponge on the
other side it actually is feeling and
looking a bit more moisturizing than I
was anticipating not sure how I feel
about this right now I'm gonna use my
finger I think first on this side yeah
it feels pretty moisturizing feels like
it sets pretty quick it didn't quite
blend out very smooth with my finger so
I'm just gonna smooth it out with a
sponge little bit I feel like it doesn't
have quite as much coverage as Tarte
shaped tape I can still see darkness
coming through but I like how it's
sitting under there
it looks nice and moisturized I'm gonna
try and add just a tiny bit right here
because that's what are some of my dark
circles are coming through let's just
try a sponge on this side brush on this
one it just doesn't really want to cover
up my darkness right there right now I
would say this one is kind of more
medium coverage curious how powders
gonna sit on top of this because usually
when concealers are really tacky on me
when I put powder on top it just kind of
like clings and kicks up a little bit
don't know how I feel about this I think
I need to use this a few more times
I'll also update in the description box
on this one maybe my dark circles are
just extra freakin dark right now cuz
I've been up since like 6:00 a.m. this
morning but I'm not used to seeing that
much
three of sediment I feel like this but
I'm gonna set my under eyes lately I've
been using the laura geller powder
actually to set him okay that looks
pretty good that looks like a nice soft
focus kind of finish under there let's
try it as a spot concealer on that acne
I'm gonna roll down my turtleneck over
here yeah I would call this medium
coverage that kind of just toned down
the redness a little bit definitely
didn't cover it up I've never understood
how people can wear white turtlenecks or
scarves and not have foundation all over
them so I haven't been setting my whole
face I basically just been setting right
where I'm gonna be applying my bronzer
and everything and highlight just so
everything glides over tea break you
know and it's too late for coffee but
you want to feel like there's caffeine
going in your body so you just drink tea
so this is the pure quick pro two piece
on-the-go highlighter and contour
palette oh kidding these are
definitely portable these are so cute
these remind me of those mirrors that
Sephora used to give out look at that
shade that looks promising
looks like there's a light one in here
we can use sweet let's do this
this is actually the perfect size to
travel with so I'm hoping this works out
because I would be taking this if it
does I just got a lot whoops
I'm gonna do the other side with the
lighter hand because I definitely just
got too much product I'm gonna go out
and blend it out with sponge or
something but let's do a little bit less
there we go ooh I like that it's great
to do if you put on too much product or
if you just want to tone it down a
little bit also since you have a little
bit of foundation left over on here it
kind of just gives it more of like a
neutral tone feels nice and soft too
there's that on the middle finger I'm
gonna swatch the second shade over
definitely too warm for my skin tone but
that could be a nice eye shadow and then
it looks like you actually get kind of a
bronzy glow a shade that's this one
right here so when you guys are seeing
this I am in California I will just left
LA I think when this video goes up and
I'll be in San Diego so we will see if I
end up packing this thing I'm gonna pop
on some ciate summer love because I have
healthy obsession right now look at it
it's just so subtle and blends in
alright now let's go in with this
headlight I'm gonna take it on the Sigma
fo3
oh yeah you can see it on camera - I
think it's emphasizing my pores a little
bit let me try it with a different brush
trying it with the morphe M 510 this
side that's a bit better
sometimes a sigma it packs on more
product so it can kind of emphasize
things a little bit more if it's already
a product that tends to do that feel
like this side definitely looks more
settled and this side right now so I'm
actually just gonna go back and with the
Sigma brush just to even things out for
the sake of this look but if I was using
that again I would use the morphe brush
why is there always one friggin hair
hanging down okay so I just put on
eyebrows obviously and prime my eyes
using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot like
always my eyebrow products will be
linked down below and for eyeshadow I
want to try out this guy this is the BH
Cosmetics Zodiac palette this has 2500
eyeshadow and highlighter palette
definitely thought these were just
eyeshadows so this looks beautiful when
I saw this thing on Instagram I got so
stoked because I just loved the layout
of this I love the colors here's a
little close-up for ya so I kind of want
to do like an icy wintry kind of makeup
looks Aires this white one in the middle
I'm assuming is oh that's Jackie that
one not the best
let's see Gemini hematite looks nice it
actually looks more of like a sky-blue
kind of silver more than a straight-up
silver that looks pretty
Capricorn feels really soft that's this
green one that one looks a nice look at
that some of them feel trucker than
others but when you kind of blend about
there's leo I think it was leo
those are some of the shimmers let's do
some of the mattes look at that army
green that was super soft oh heck yeah
look at that shade matte black so I was
just about to say like a true test for
me look out for
in black that is I'm gonna need to go
wash my hands going up the arm now okay
I'm excited now could really go for some
papa john's pizza you know
oh that actually sounds so good so i'm
going to take the mat hand shade right
there whoa the mirror on this thing is
one of those mirrors that like makes you
feel really dizzy really pigmented
blending out easily I think I'm actually
gonna go in with the black right now I
kind of want like a matte blue kind of
shade increase but there's no blue shade
and there's four shades of purple people
will do the pink I'm gonna put that pink
that looks purple right into the crease
I think is just as it was layered with
that tan there it is without and it's
actually a nice not chalky pink which is
hard to do if you're like there we go I
think we're gonna go for like a cotton
candy kind of thing way these are
blending out are really nice they don't
feel too powdery and they're kind of
like stay in there which I like but
they're still blending so I'm gonna go
in with Ares which is that blue shade
and first I'm gonna try it not wet with
the brush okay looks like a like wet
metallic kind of shade oh that's pretty
I want to make this a lighter blue shade
by adding the silver overtop so it's
gonna look darker right now gonna make
it kind of icy I'm gonna go in with
Gemini I want to put this right on the
center just to see what it looks like
first oh yeah that's what I'm going for
okay I'm gonna put that all over on top
of the blue just kind of lightens it I'm
gonna go in Gemini and now wet it on a
brush to get a little bit of a pop right
in the middle there we go
these are friggin pretty I really feel
like I need to use the black shade in
this palette I'm gonna go with the black
shade on the liner brush and just stamp
that right below I think I want to take
that same pink to blend out on the
bottom so at the risk of going overboard
right now I kind of wonder has glitter
liner this is by elf and it's Stardust
glitter eyeliner
the shades seafoam it looks like it has
kind of like a reflect purpley in there
so I think it might look good with this
I'm thinking I want to put it on the
inner corner oh this looks like green
okay I have another shade let me see it
this one oh there we go
pink opal that's the line one actually
looks pretty purple could just be
because it's like picking up on some of
the pink shadow and stuff the mirror on
here is so distorted that I'm like
actually not sure where my eyeball is
right now I'm just guessing I'm just
gonna put on a thin coat of mascara and
then I'm gonna put on these new false
lashes I haven't tried before so you
said the lashes they're the Ardell faux
mink which I love this line I just
haven't tried this specific style the
eight Elevens are one of my favorite
lashes but these are the eight tens and
one of you guys actually recommend these
in the comments and they look really
nice they have that like separated kind
of look just started applying brow liner
do my eyelash I just looked in that
palette right now the age has medics
always changed their prices but right
now that pallets on sale for 17 bucks
normally 21 for 17 freakin bucks I mean
I think for 22 bucks is worth it but
especially for 17 there we go these
actually look quite a bit more and
natural than I was expecting
they look like they're gonna be a little
bit more dramatic I like it I think with
this eye look I would have gone with
something a little bit more dramatic
just tie it all together this is wet and
wild mega length I use this everyday for
bottom lashes bro can you get it
together okay so for lips I think I'm
gonna do like a pinky kind of nude just
to tie in the pink and everything so I'm
gonna go in with maybelline nude whisper
105 liner I think I'm gonna take 755
nude thrill see how that looks I like
that but I kind of want to add a little
bit of gloss so I'm gonna top it off
with mu a baby pink one of the best
pinky nude glosses alright so this is
the final look whatever happened today
I just noticed there's a huge smear of
foundation aggress my camera right now
so that's that I hope you guys enjoyed
