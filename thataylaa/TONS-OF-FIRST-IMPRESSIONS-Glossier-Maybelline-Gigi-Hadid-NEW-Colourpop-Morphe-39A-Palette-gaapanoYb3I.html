here I feel like I'm standing in the
presence of the celebrity
all right so today we have a ton of
first impressions I feel like I've been
doing a lot of first impressions videos
lately but the stuff has just been
piling up I feel like brands are just
popping out the new products right now
so I had a bunch of stuff that I wanted
to try out so I figured why not do with
you guys but we're trying out some new
colour-pop stuff the new Maybelline Gigi
Hadid collection new 30 what is this 39
a pellet this is also the look that I
wore in the Sephora and Ulta haul video
I'm filming these the same day so a few
of the products I'm trying out are ones
that I mentioned in that video I'll link
that in little eye in down below if you
missed it so if you're excited for this
video and you enjoy while you're
watching and don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby doe family and subscribe
but upload every Monday Wednesday Friday
6 p.m. Pacific time alright so I've
already washed moisturized and primed my
face basically the exact same way that I
mentioned in the jus a foundation Friday
video I want to try out this setting
spray underneath my makeup - I'm gonna
use this on top as well but this is new
by colour-pop I'm so excited that they
came out with a setting spray I think I
have about 35 setting sprays at this
point but could always use another
setting spray you know I'm saying this
actually comes in a glass bottle which
is really nice and it says amber I'm
spread out my hand oh it smells like
mango oh it has mango flower in it and
peach I'm not that into the peach scent
fruity scents are just not my thing like
I want to eat fruit I don't want to put
it on my face that mister isn't super
fine quite the intense sprayer on there
like it gave a slight glow so Foundation
first impressions I usually like to save
for foundation Friday videos but this is
gonna be a first impression combo so I
haven't mix these two before this is the
G way essential high coverage just add a
foundation Friday on this I'm gonna try
mixing it with the CYO long-lasting life
proof foundation I love this one for
lightening and adding that like do we
really plump look and I feel like that's
what this one is missing and this is too
dark this is in the shade shell so I
think these two might be good and then
blend this oh I might have mixed that
too dark see it looks totally fine in
the viewfinder and in real life it looks
like a shade too dark
it makes way too much I forgot
jus a a little bit goes a super long way
I have enough for like five phases right
here okay so that combo looks pretty
nice I think I could have definitely
mixed in a little bit more of the CYO
I'm gonna take just the smallest amount
of CYO and put it right on the center of
my forehead just to kind of smooth it
out right there
using that almost as like concealer to
highlight the center of my face just
love how that foundation sits on your
skin so my victoria victoria secret no
sephora vib sale haul it will have
already gone up by the time you guys are
seeing this video and i'm gonna be
trying out some of the stuff that i
mentioned in that video this is one of
the products I mentioned that this is
the Tarte merica creaseless concealer
I'm on the hunt to find a good concealer
for a drier under eyes few of you guys
in my shadow and schmooze video said to
try the Becca aqua luminous I feel like
I tried that when it first came out and
I feel like it was way too dark but
maybe I'll order that again and see so
this is a little squeeze tube packaging
holy cease this is thick okay this
is the workout squeezing this tube I'm
gonna start out with pretty small amount
this is an interesting consistency it
feels thick and creamy but still
lightweight it's not like quite as
opaque coverage as I'm used to like the
Tarte shaped tape I can still see some
stuff coming through it's more of just
brightening a little bit and bring this
a little bit over my eyes it is starting
to crease a little bit I'm gonna go in
with just my normal setting powders I
feel like if I'm testing a new concealer
that's the best way to be able to see if
I like it by using it with my usual
powders these are just the Physicians
Formula powders I always use they'll be
linked down below
yeah it looks way better on camera still
getting some creasing I don't know it
just feels like and you concealed areas
lately just makes me look like 10 years
older under there
not bad off the bat I would use this
again I'm not like in love with it and I
don't think it looks necessarily any
better than the sharp sharp with heart
shape tape
alright so brows I'm gonna try at the
glossy a boy brow in brown I feel like
I'm standing in the presence of the
celebrity or something I've heard so
much about this
like one of those products that people
swear by and rave about so I feel like I
have really high expectations right now
but let's just take it down a couple
notches cuz it's just a brow gel it
looks like it might be a little bit
light lately when I've been using brow
gels I'll put it on first and then I'll
kind of go around it with my brow pencil
to just fill in the shape a little bit
more but I've been really liking the
look of like brushed up kind of Messier
brows which is why I picked this up so
when I ordered this I also tried the
glossy a body oil which is new from them
glossy is like one of those cult kind of
brands like they have a cult following I
actually listen to a podcast about their
founder a while ago and it kind of
piqued my interest to try it
I feel like this side needs to be a
little bit more uppity though the shade
I could definitely go shade darker I
think I need to trim my brow hairs a
little bit for this look actually hey if
scissors right here I'll probably fall
over my foundation feels like it's kind
of setting but it doesn't feel crispy I
still want to add a little bit of shape
to the top arch right here so I'm gonna
go in with my normal brow pencil for
that
what the heck for some reason this
doesn't want to go over top of this okay
I'm gonna try the Cobra instead I wonder
if there's some kind of oil or something
in this that product doesn't want to go
over top that's a little better but next
time I would definitely use brow product
first and then going with the brow gel
because something something weird is
happening
it's like wax or something do you guys
see that I don't know how I feel about
my brows right now I think that color is
just throwing me off let me go ahead and
prime my eyes so I just watched a bunch
of shades from the morphe 39 a huge-ass
palette I don't have a new bronzer or
contour to try out so I'm kind of
improvising here and I want to try out
one of these shades so it's kind of
swatching those two shades to see which
one might work as a contour or bronzer
and I think this shade right here might
work I haven't tried this palette at all
yet I'm just gonna tap once cuz it
looked pretty pigmented
okay so with a light hand that totally
works that definitely works and I like
how that looks so for blush I mentioned
this one in that haul video but this is
a ciaté glowed too illuminating blush
in the shade summer love this is like
one of those things that I put in and
out of my cart ten times as I couldn't
decide based on the reviews and
everything if I was in like this Oh cute
packaging I really like that packaging
it's very small and like compact this is
an illuminating blush so if you don't
like your blushes to have any kind of
shimmer to them you probably wouldn't
like this but let's see what it looks
like they're just like super tiny little
stars and things on there this reminds
me actually of the Too Faced Papa don't
peach the look of it exactly the shade
but just the look of it I really like
these kind of more sheer blushes that
you can just get like a slight wash of
color
woo I like that pretty sheer but
buildable have like five different
eyeshadow palettes here that I'm
debating between for my eyes I might use
like a combo of them all but I wanted to
use one of the shades as a face
highlight today I'm debating between the
Maybelline Gigi Hadid cool palette this
shade that shade right there this one is
a totally different shade than the other
one I'm debating between in the color
pop semi-precious I do want to try this
shade it looks like a rose gold kind of
that could be really pretty I think
we're gonna try that one I think this
palette too is that Sephora now okay
that's pretty it's emphasizing my
texture a little bit more than I like
but I'm gonna do the other side and then
I'll probably add a little bit of that
Maybelline on top yeah I'm gonna go in
with this Maybelline one to really make
it pop okay shade wise I like that one
but again I think it just emphasizes
yeah just emphasizes everything a little
bit more than what I like a lot of
people love that look so if you do you
might like these as face highlights to
the more this is on my face my concealer
it's looking not so great there's no
mirror on that yeah it doesn't look that
great I'm getting a lot of creasing
already and I also feel like just some
of my darkness and stuff is still coming
through go ahead and blend all that
their palates I'm debating between
trying are the Maybelline ones to color
pop new ones semi-precious and golden
state of mind this one I've definitely
seen on Sephora this is what the inside
looks like they look like kind of foiled
glitter shadows almost but then also I'm
really drawn to the army green shades in
here like look at that shade that shade
is speaking to me right now so I think
I'm gonna go in with this palette and
start out with the same shade that I
used as a face contour today now I'm
taking the next over shade which is just
a little bit more warm toned this is
part of the holiday collection I don't
know why they make they're like most
beautiful best packaged palettes Limited
Edition every time I'm gonna go in with
that worn shade the assortment of shades
and everything in here are really pretty
and I'm gonna put that into the crease
is it just me or does this I roll up way
darker I just noticed that what is
happening with this thing I'm gonna add
some more of this this bro
I feel like that one looks like gray and
this one looks brown now I'm gonna go
into that army green shade which is just
beacon to me that matches my shirt like
exactly well just got a lot of Fallout
well the color of that though is so
pretty I feel like I actually don't have
a shape like this now that I think about
it guys love that I'm gonna blend out
that green with like a warm brown
holding this thing up every time is so
fun
okay first I'm gonna go in and blend it
out with this shade right here which is
like more camel Brown blending out the
edges okay I think I'm gonna take this
whoa
it actually looks of gold now that I'm
seeing it in front of light but I was
just looking at it look straight up
green ooh that might be really pretty
for the inner corner so I'm gonna take
this to wet my brush for this I love the
color that that turned out on top of the
green
oh no that's like the color I'm kind of
just bringing that over like the first
third of my eye and I think I'm gonna
pop something a little bit lighter on
the bottom I'm getting a shit-ton to
fall out okay so there isn't a light
kind of shimmer shade in here at all
so I'm gonna go in with I think that
Maybelline palette oh there's also this
reflective gold kind of shade that
almost has a little bit of a green tint
to it there's that what was that with
like a southern accent there's that
shade here's the Rose one oh that might
be pretty that's like a sage kind of
color I think I'm gonna do the gold
right here and then bring the green kind
of more towards the middle wetting my
brush again this might be one that you
need to use your finger with nope ooh
look at that that is pretty yeah you
definitely want to wet this there's the
difference if you want that like major
pot now I'm gonna take that sage kind of
color and put that right on the center
now we're gonna go back into this bad
boy and take some of the deep brown
shades for the outer third on the lower
lash line first I'm gonna go in with
this shade on a really flat liner brush
I'm curious about the black in here
actually let's watch it oh my god this
is so soft this is actually one of the
softest eyeshadows I've ever felt what
is in here don't know how it blends out
yet obviously because I haven't put this
on my eyes but just feeling that in the
pan it feels like not an eyeshadow I
don't know what this feels like but what
is in here does a brown feel like that
the brown stone feels nice but it
doesn't feel like literal butter it's
gonna press this into my lashline and I
am gonna do kind of a wing I think on
the upper lash line I'm gonna try that
black just because I can't not no oh
yeah I'm gonna come back to blend out
that lower lash line but I first want to
put on waterline eyeliner have two
eyeliners here from the Maybelline Gigi
Hadid collection and then this is a
black liquid liner let's see how this
goes for the waterline whew that just
went on very black
I just tried one of the Maybelline
liner's out in which video is that one
of the first impressions and I found
that it went on super black but when I
wore it again it kind of like bled into
my inner corner so I hope that this
doesn't do that going in for the liquid
liner nice packaging this is like matte
tan packaging feels very light weights
or anything in here nice and matte black
okay got a nice fine point and that was
pretty quick and easy not bad
damn it that one just got a little wild
all right that one's definitely a little
bit bigger I think but I feel like if I
touch this one I'm just gonna ruin that
one go on try the same line of mascara
so this is lash sensational so I'm
wondering if this is just the same lash
sensational but repackaged probably by
the way the Maybelline lash sensational
the original one in the pink bottle that
is one of my favorite mascaras haven't
used it in a long time no I used to
always use Maybelline falsies mascara
and then this one when it came out the
pink one and then ever since I found my
Catrice glam and all layered with the
two-faced breath and sex that's been my
like go-to combo before I put on false
lashes I'm just gonna blend out that
lower lash line a little bit I'm gonna
go back in with that deep brown shade
and use a smudger brush instead this is
the Sedona lace 9:04 brush I have a
country song stuck in my head right now
Who am I I feel like there's more
fallout in this palette than usual like
I'm having to wipe a lot okay so I just
finished up putting on false lashes and
doing my bottom lash mascara just use
the pure diva lashes I feel like my
brows right now are just a little too
natural a little too light for the
dramatic kind of eye look I have going
on so I think I'm gonna go in with the
old to brow tint and deep and see if
this goes over it see if we can put
anything over this thing that's that's a
little better for lips I have a couple
of different things I might try two of
the shades the Gigi Hadid lipstick this
is the shade
tarah tora tora and this is the shade
MacColl it's like a little bit lighter
and a little bit more pinky mom let's go
about this one what is this is Tora ooh
that's a nice nude I like that I hate
the smell of Maybelline lipsticks but
this shade is super pretty I almost
don't want to add anything on top of
this this is like a really nice everyday
kind of nude it feels nice and
moisturizing cease I forgot to
spray that setting spray again I don't
really want to spray it now any time I
do that after I put on false lashes my
eyes just burn for like two hours so
quick overview of everything that
foundation combo I would wear again
obviously don't know how this is gonna
wear throughout the day it's actually
pretty late right now it's 4 p.m. but I
love the finish of it I really like
adding that CYO foundation on top makes
it look a little bit more smooth and if
you want to know my thoughts in those
ua1 you can go watch that video the
blush I'm feeling I would definitely use
that again if you like kind of subtle
glowy blushes you might like that
highlight I wouldn't use those
eyeshadows again as a highlight oh that
looks great
the shades I used out of this palette
the 39a I really like that army green
shade is just beautiful and again I feel
like that's the shade that I don't
really have at all but there is a
ton of fallout so just keep that in mind
if that's something that bothers you
these are super pretty I want to try out
some of the other shades but the two
that I used wet I really like especially
what the liquid liner I would use again
I feel like I got pretty easy point with
it and it's nice and matte and black so
to use that one again this one went on
super easy super black on the waterline
obviously the lipstick shade I'm really
feeling almost
oh boy brow I mean I think we know how I
feel about boy brow and definitely mixed
feelings on this right now I'm kind of
confused I'm gonna try this though as a
last step and see what I think of it
this might be one that grows on me as I
use it more oh the concealer the tarte
concealer like I said I would use it
again to try but I don't really like the
way my under eyes look right now I feel
like I crease just as much and I'm
getting less coverage than I usually do
setting spray personally I'm not that
into just because of the scent not my
thing but if you like fruity scents you
might like it
like in the morning putting this scent
on my face I was just like puke I think
that was everything if you enjoyed this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up so I know everything that I tried out
today and I saw my face will be listed
down below in the description box if you
want to go back and watch any other
first impressions videos also have the
playlist down below but I love you guys
