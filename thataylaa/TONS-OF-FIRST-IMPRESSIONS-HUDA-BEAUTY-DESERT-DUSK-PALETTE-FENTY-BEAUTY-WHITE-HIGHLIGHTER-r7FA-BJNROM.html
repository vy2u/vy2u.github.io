bunch of new stuff I've had this pile of
stuff sitting in the corner of my desk
for weeks now has been so difficult to
not put the stuff on my face but I'm
doing a bunch of first impressions
trying out the huda beauty desert best
palette a Fanta beauty highlighter the
j1 jelly pack which has been really
talked about lately and a bunch of other
good stuff so if you enjoy this video
while you're watching don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you want to see
how I got this look you're in the right
place just keep watching
well almost knocked over Fendi okay so
I've spent the last like 45 minutes
playing around with the lighting and
everything because I still feel like
when I watch my videos back you can't
see what I'm talking about and I want
you guys to be able to actually like see
my pores in my face because that's what
we're doing here so I actually have my
two normal lights on but I have the ring
light completely off and then I have my
windows open so I have a little bit of
natural light coming in obviously this
would only work when there is light let
me know what you guys think of this
setup if you can see my skin a little
bit better just looking at my viewfinder
over here I can see my pores which I
feel like I usually can't so maybe
that's a good sign
okay so I have so many things to try out
today I'm gonna start out with
moisturizer I haven't put on anything on
my face yet I just washed it I have two
products from soap &amp;amp; Glory that I'm
really curious about this is a spritz me
quick super hydrating moisture mist this
doesn't sound like a setting spray I
read the back of it and it sounds more
like a spray moisturizer is liquid shea
butter oil technology and sugarcane
juice it's fast absorbing yes like a
pure liquid this is the speed plump
all-day moisture marble think I want to
use the hydrating one just cuz that
seems really interesting to me but I
kind of want to like smell this and
everything okay yeah let's test out this
spritzer yes ma'am I got well I can't
smell anything
mmm oh I just got a whiff oh that smells
so good this smells like their body
butter I don't know how good that would
be for your face but mmm oh this has a
really not great mister it's not really
a mister I can feel it absorbing in that
feels nice it feels a bit tacky but if
you're sensitive to scents that one
might knock you out so this primer I've
been so curious about this is the
jae-won jelly pack I've been hearing so
much about this lately
I believe this white bottle
the original one from Korea if you get
it a Sephora now I'm pretty sure they
switched it to a black bottle but I read
is it's the same exact product it's just
way cheaper if you get the white bottle
and you can get off Amazon so that's
what I did it says this dramatic firming
skin with improved elasticity and poor
smoothing this is supposed to be like
glue oh that is not what I was expecting
whoa what does this feel like Oh
interesting
oh this feels like the peel off thing
the duracell yeah that's exactly what
this feels like this is no joke this
legit feels like glue it's like super
sticky personally I do like a bit of
tackiness to my primers rather than like
a super slick primer because I don't
really like blend out my foundation I
like to stipple it on and I feel like
primers that have a bit of tackiness
just helped my makeup stay on better so
in my time I'm still testing foundations
for the wrap up video the 15 is a
foundation wrap up video so what I'm
gonna do today is mix two foundations
I'm gonna mix the peach perfect to come
from matte foundation I loved with the
milk makeup blur liquid haven't tried
this combo yet I feel like this one will
help out a bit of more pink tones to it
and also add a bit of coverage and I
want to test out this curved kabuki
brush by Sigma this is the F 83 what the
heck is this shape it looks like there
was like a malfunction in the making of
this but it does kind of like her hug
does hug your face really nice this is a
weird it does like hug your face by the
way my lash extensions are looking super
janky right now because I'm going to get
them filled in a couple days I might put
those lashes on today I don't know that
could be a disastrous idea okay that
combo is looking nice I like this brush
actually it's kind of surprising me I
know if I like it more than the regular
Sigma f80 or the f82 but it's working
good I don't feel like it's sitting
weird on top of that primer or anything
I'm pre recording so I don't think I'm
gonna be able to leave this one on all
day cuz I think I need to film a second
video today but I'll definitely keep
testing out that primer this is a new
concealer from Sephora is there make no
mistake high coverage concealer let's
hope this is better than
there make no mistake foundation stick
oh it's like a squeeze tube I thought it
was gonna be like a you know I'm just
starting with the tiny well this is
thick
okay so tiny bit goes a really long way
it's very tacky usually when I have a
super tacky concealer like this that
doesn't really dry down when I set it
with powder it can make it look a little
bit too creepy
you need like an ant-sized amount of
this I feel like with that primer I
would still need to use my Revlon pore
reducing primer because you can
definitely still majorly see my pores I
didn't really do anything for that it's
already starting to crease a little bit
I just set my under eyes set my face I
use the carbo blu-ray High Definition
powder I've been really liking this it
gives like a soft matte kind of finished
the concealer I think looks fine I'm not
like in love with it but I also don't
think it looks horrible
so Sephora started doing their like
weekly wow thing where it's basically a
ton of they have good products on there
and they're like half off or way marked
down so I got this benefit bigger and
bolder brows kit I don't remember how
much this was but it was definitely like
under 20 bucks
I think you get four different products
in here this packaging is adorable so
you get a cab brow I think I got it
mostly for this because I love to give
me a brow and then I think what pencil
is this that's the high brow I really
want to try the Cobra this is in the
shade 5o comes with a little brush and
then the actual product is down here
okay this brush is pretty stiff it's a
little bit hard to work with I think I'm
gonna switch to my normal brush lately
I've been using this BH Cosmetics brush
it's number 12 like the shade of this a
lot deep brown but not too cool or too
warm the formula feels that tiny bit
more creamy than that and Nastasia dip
brow but also mine's like super dried
out so it could just be because of that
so I finished off the brows and I liked
this concealer to carve them out it
worked pretty well
so I primed my eyes with the Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot is what I always used to
prime my eyes I am so freakin excited to
try this out this is the hood of beauty
desert dust palette I haven't watched
any reviews on this yet or anything so I
have no idea what this is gonna be like
but this packaging from PR was so
freakin cool I've show you guys this do
there is actual sand in here whoo
retrograde right here is speaking to me
it looks like Mack what's that shape I'm
talking about blue brown I think it was
called that Pigman when it hits the
light like that but then from the side
it's like purple dude this lighting is
so much easier showing you guys products
up close that's definitely upside down
I'm really good at this so first I'm
gonna go in with the shade I think Eden
may be deserts and I might mix the two
what is up with this blue tint today
literally and white balancing every two
seconds let's go in with Eden now I'm
going to take desert sand and blend that
on top a little bit blending out super
easily whoa
I'm thinking that this needs a little
something underneath it there a tiny bit
chalky but then when you like blend them
out it works okay that looks cool I
think I'm gonna do saffron which was a
matte red shade and then put retrograde
on top that's what that is right there
dude that shade is so pretty that is a
beautiful like burgundy matte shade did
I kind of blend out those edges I think
I'm gonna want to add amethyst this
matte purple shade I don't even know
where we're going with this look right
now let's just hope it all comes
together just adding a bit more of that
red right on the lid I got that shade
I'm gonna go back in with Eden blend out
those edges of it honestly feel like you
could stop there if you wanted to if you
just want like a super matte look I
really like that red shade but I'm
really curious about retrograde I'm
gonna wet my brush and attempt to Pat
retrograde on the lid oh yeah even with
this like it's not super super opaque so
I definitely think you would need to put
a shadow underneath it but I mean look
at that color
so for water line eyeliner I want to try
this prestige magic pen
someone needs to invent something where
you just pop in a product and it takes
off all the annoying plastic wrap oh
this is a primer all right well I guess
we can still try that but let me grab
another eyeliner okay let's try this one
I can't remember if I've tried this or
not before it doesn't look like I have
really this is the essence gel
waterproof liner oh it's going on nice
on the waterline I'm gonna do some major
smudging and blending so I'm gonna go in
with ODE I'm just gonna kind of press
this really close to my waterline oh
that is a really pretty brown if you
have green eyes this will like make them
pop ooh I really like that Brown now I'm
gonna blend that lower lash line with
Eden again that first shade we put on
these blend out so easily I'm into these
shadows I am getting a little tiny bit
of Fallout nothing major at all so I'm
just gonna brush it away so I don't
think I want to do a liquid liner but
I'm gonna put on false lashes I normally
wouldn't with the lash extensions but
they're on their last limb so I'm also
gonna add lower lash line mascara but
first let's do the face I didn't have
any new first impressions for contour or
blush so I just went in with the
Smashbox contour palette I've been
obsessed with this shade it just is
perfection for blush I use two-faced
Papa don't peach I really like this I
think it just warms up my face really
nice it's not too intense so for
highlight I'm gonna try out the Fenty
Beauty highlight everyone has been
raving about these I did use a different
highlight where did it go is that in the
Fendi Beauty Foundation video that one
is beautiful I haven't tried out this
one yet this is the kilowatt freestyle
highlighter in metal moons is like the
big pan white highlighter I did test the
gold one in the store and it's just not
for me
it's super glittery but this one looked
really pretty and I think this has a bit
of like blue duochrome to it when it's
on your face I haven't tried this yet or
try it with my morphe M 510 whew it has
almost like a gold ooh
Priti has more of a gold reflect to it I
thought it was gonna be kind of blue
this is pretty oh definitely wear this
again I think I still like the other one
a bit more where the heck did I put that
got it
this one's girl-next-door and Chic freak
us one's a little bit softer I feel like
the shade more of that like wet look I'm
gonna add a little bit of the pink shade
to my nose actually let's just layer
this why not there's something about
this one it's just a bit softer this
setting spray I mentioned in a different
video but this just makes your highlight
friggin pop makes your skin look really
good so I'm gonna set my face with this
okay let's do it before here's before
there's something magical about this
setting spray it just makes your skin
look so good it like settles all the
powders in if you don't like the dew you
won't like this setting spray but if you
do like to do you should do it and I'm
trying to put the wrong cap on for like
10 minutes okay hello yeah it is do you
ever like almost hang up on someone and
then it ends up being an actual
important call
that just happened so before I finish
off the eyes let's do lip sync this will
actually match really well this is the
new Oprah nikkietutorials what shade is
this oh I don't think the shade is on
here Dutchess that's what this is called
if you haven't tried the ofra liquid
lipstick formulas they're great they're
moisturizing they dried down pretty
long-lasting and they smell bomb they
smell like cake ooh that's super pretty
I feel like the shade is a super pretty
fall color that's like a little bit
different since it's like a deeper kind
of purple mauve so I'm gonna pop on the
pur diva lashes and I'll be right back
okay that was a struggle and a half
putting false lashes on was not my best
idea I don't even know if this lash is
on my eyeball there's like 5,000 things
poking my eye so this is the final look
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
think thing I'm most excited about is
this palette I think the matte shades in
here that I used at least are gorgeous
I'm excited to keep playing around with
these because what with the matte shades
obviously the shimmers are really pretty
too I just feel like you're gonna have
to work with them a little bit more
a little bit more sheer the Fenty
highlighters are beautiful I feel like
this one is a little bit more unique I
don't know if metal moon is like an
absolute must I feel like there are
really similar highlighters that are
much cheaper I don't know I just feel
like this is kind of it's pretty but I
don't feel like you need to like rush
out and go buy it the concealer I mean
my under eyes look not bad I would use
the concealer again I'm gonna see what I
think of it I feel like it's one of
those that I need to use more than once
to kind of have an idea of how I feel
about it I'm also really curious to keep
using this hopefully this doesn't break
me out so that's everything I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you're
