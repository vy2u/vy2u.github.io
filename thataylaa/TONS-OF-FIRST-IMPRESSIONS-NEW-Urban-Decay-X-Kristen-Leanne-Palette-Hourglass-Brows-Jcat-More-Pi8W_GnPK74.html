all right so today it is first
impression time I have a ton of new
stuff here new releases then also just
some stuff that's new to me but I have a
couple new eyeshadow palettes face
products blush highlight we've got some
winners today also had some duds feeling
very peacock esque today so if you enjoy
first impression videos and you like
this video while you're watching don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can click the subscribe
button you might be over here so if you
want to see what I think of a bunch of
products and how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
alright so like I said in Monday's video
I got a new lens that is currently on
and I repositioned it different from
Monday's video so let me know if you
guys liked this setup more I can
basically let's do this look at that
zoom I can zoom in even more the only
thing is it's now in my desk and this is
as low as the tripod goes so I kind of
feel like I'm like looking up like it's
too far down it's always hard for me to
tell too in the viewfinder until I'm
editing this back so we might need a few
trial runs but I'll get it eventually
hopefully so I've already washed
moisturize and we have like three
different primers to try out here I want
to somehow try and use all three of
these this one I'm so excited to try
this as the origins original skin pore
perfecting cooling primer this reminds
me of like a shaving cream bottle so I'm
curious to see if this is gonna be like
whipped sounds like whipped cream ooh
hot chocolate sounds a bomb right now
how's it tint to it I don't think this
is fully shaken up that's kind of
anticlimactic okay let's put this on
woah turns into like a really soft kind
of liquid mmm smells good smells like a
spa it does feel cooling I think I love
cooling kind of products and it's set in
really nice actually gave like a bit of
moisture I thought it was gonna be a
little more I don't know like mattifying
or perfecting I don't feel like it did a
whole lot for my pores but feels like I
have a nice base on now I have the new
milk makeup illuminating blur stick
luminous blur stick so this is supposed
to be like their other blur stick just
give you kind of a glow I wasn't a big
fan of the other blur stick I think I'm
gonna try this just on my pores maybe
like the center of my forehead just to
see if it blurs at all
I guess you wouldn't really want this
area luminous though I want my forehead
luminous but not really around my poor
area I don't feel like that really did
anything to my pores I do see a little
bit of shine though which again I don't
really want there let's do a center my
forehead I think I'm gonna leave this
side without mm-hmm I don't feel like
that did anything not a fan of that I
feel like it literally just added a bit
of shine also interesting because this
said that you could use in place of your
foundation all right
extensions are out to party it's all
good so this is the jcat makeup primer
rose spray they also had a jasmine one
I'm hoping this is very hydrating
because I'm actually gonna be using a
foundation that's not a first impression
I have a whole review on this but I want
to try it again I'll talk about that in
a second let's put on this primer I
basically want a super hydrated base for
that foundation
I'm hoping this is kind of like the
Heritage rosewater that gives you a
little bit of a glow setting spray gods
give me a good mister here smells like
rose
I'm not a big rose scent fan feels nice
and refreshing and that mister was
pretty nice that definitely gave me a
little glow has a little bit of
tackiness to it which is nice for
underneath makeup in my opinion so like
I said I have a whole video on the YSL
all ours foundation I will link that
down below and in the eye I'm not a big
fan of this foundation I want to try it
again though now with my skin like this
and a ton of you guys have been
commenting saying to try out old
foundations that I didn't used to like
when I had acne and oily skin and see
how it works for my skin now so I like
that idea I might do that
maybe I'll do some of those for
foundation Friday let me know if you
guys would want to see that and then
this is the first impression this is the
Sephora cake and baked sponge so I
already dampened this thing and it
didn't get a whole lot bigger it feels
like the material of the red morphe
sponges this you can use wet or dry you
can use it to bake hence the name bake
your under eyes you could apply
concealer with this you could apply your
full face foundation with this so I'm
gonna try it for a foundation I might
also try it for concealer maybe some
powder for really getting wild it says
to pick up liquid or powder makeup with
the top or bottom flange okay here we go
YSL
it feels pretty like firm I would say oh
man I forgot how frigging sent it this
foundation is a little bit tricky to get
in the crevice of your nose I feel like
the super luxury brands like Dior and
why I sell and stuff their foundations
all smell the same they have this super
overly scented floral scent
can we not whenever I say can we not now
I just think of Kaitlyn Bristowe comment
down below if you listen to her podcast
i memory card you just got full but in
that time I looked back on this clip and
I feel like it does look a little bit
too like what's the word up like a
little bit weird of an angle so I'm
probably gonna get a different tripod or
something but we're gonna try and try
this for this video
definitely looks much less heavy and
cakey than last time I use this I think
the rose water has a lot to do with it
though because my skin is already pretty
glowy not a big fan of this sponge for a
liquid foundation
it just feels pretty hard I don't feel
like it's soaked up a whole lot which is
nice but it just feels a little bit hard
I might like this better for under-eye
concealer powder or something I'm gonna
do my eco-schools sponge on the other
tool on the other tool on the other side
I do feel like this side is actually
soaking up a bit more and it doesn't
look quite as luminous at all what she's
interesting and then I bought the shape
of the sponge just reminds me of a pool
toy who's ready for summer right now I'm
still full-on in winter mode this
foundation still doesn't look like full
coverage to me I can still see scarring
and stuff coming through I'm gonna zoom
in that can alright look at that zoom
you guys are gonna be able to see
everything now I turned it down so I
think hopefully you can see still don't
feel like it's a full coverage this is
not a foundation review let's zoom out
I'm just building this up a little bit
with this sponge I am getting much more
of a luminous finish when I use this
sponge not looking good on my nose I
think you guys can see that oh oh oh
it's like clinging weird on my nose
I'm be trying out this concealer this is
the number seven radiant glow under-eye
concealer in the shade 10 I haven't
tried a whole lot of number 7 products
there are a couple foundations that you
guys request really often so I'm gonna
do I think is to lift and illuminate one
which I need to get and then there's a
different one let me know down below
what number 7 foundations I should try
out
so this
is like a pump thing oh cool that's like
a click top feel like I'm about to give
someone a shot okay ten hours later we
have some coming out I really don't like
these kind of applicators brush ones
usually you can take it off which I will
probably end up doing if I like this can
use my usual concealer brush this is the
morphe g 38 i always use and blend this
out definitely on the lighter coverage
end this isn't like shape tape coverage
or anything you can still see freckles
you still see darkness coming through
actually to the finish of it looks
really nice it almost looks like
invisible like I would try this one
again when I just want a little
something but I don't want it to look
like I have makeup on with the full face
of makeup probably wouldn't use this I
still have a lot of darkness coming
through in the front so I'm going to go
over this with just a touch of the
forever 21 concealer stick which I'm
still trying out I use this again in
Monday's video can't tell how I feel
about this I really like the tone of it
I like the color a lot it just helped
waken me up waking me up wake me up
we're gonna do some powdering with this
thing go back in with the pool toy I'm
gonna use my usual Physicians Formula
powders which will be linked down below
everything I'm trying right now is
always in the description box it doesn't
feel very damp at all right now it
almost feels dry which is typically how
I like to apply my powder if I'm gonna
be using a sponge we're just mixing
these two shades and let's go ahead and
do this okay this fits under the eyes
perfectly ooh that worked pretty nice it
just kind of pressed it in there doesn't
look like I have really a powder on
under there okay
cake and bake here we go I love the way
it just feels under there this would be
good to also clean up your shadow
because you have this super straight
edge I am very excited to try this
powder
I found this in like the depths of the
Internet when I was doing research for
hydrating powders for dry skin and I
found the by Terry hyaluronic hydra
powder i just got a small size of this
and I feel like this size was pretty
affordable I think it was like 14 bucks
I might be totally off networker this
Wow though I've been waiting to try out
this powder in a video much you get you
get 1.3 grams in here think I'm gonna
use that same powder side and first try
and press this in definitely has a bit
like a weight cast to it that's like
totally clinging weird and it seemed to
remove some of my foundation coverage
right there my skin is weird with loose
powders very hit-or-miss I think I have
like two loose powders that actually
work for my skin so I'm gonna go in with
a brush and just blend this out or
attempt to let's try the other side with
just going out the brush oh this
foundation looks terrible and my nose
it's like completely rubbing off yeah my
skin is not looking great right now I
feel like I need to try the powder with
the foundation that I like underneath
I'm gonna definitely leave my forehead
cuz I think it's just gonna look bad if
I powder that too and I bronzer and
everything on it'll kind of even
everything out if you like this powder
let me know what foundation you wear it
with so I have two new brow products
here to try from hourglass this is our
arch brow volumizing fiber gel which
sounds exciting and then there's also a
pencil product this is the brow
sculpting pencil this one has that kind
of triangle
angular tip to it and then there's also
a spoolie on the other end I'm gonna use
this I think I'm gonna try the brow gel
first and then just kind of fill in the
shape with the pencil try to have in the
brow gel is dark brunette does it's a
fiber gel so I'm hoping this kind of
adds that hair like look this is a
pretty big wand I wish they made the
wand a little bit smaller
I like that shade it's a nice cool toned
brown shade does it have a little shine
to it
well that side looks a little bit wild I
think because I have more hairs right
here this applicator is too large I'm
gonna have to do some major
concealer cleaning up right there
because it just kind of easily gets out
of your brows let's show you the pencils
this is also dark brunette I'm gonna
give the gel a minute to set because
sometimes when you go in with the pencil
right after you just kind of move around
the
product ooh that one I like I really
like the shade of this and it's going on
really smooth but not too pigmented okay
like that I feel like the brow gel does
have a bit of a shine to it though I'm
definitely gonna be using this pencil
again just pretty easy to get a good
shape going with my handy paint brush
again and concealer a stick and just
clean this up just prime my eyes with my
usual Mac Paint Pot the bronzer isn't a
first impression it's just one that I
want to try a little bit more but the
highlight and blush are I'm gonna use
the girl lactic cobweb bronzer some days
I feel like I really like it and then
others it just doesn't really blend out
very well I'm gonna use this on my
temples a little bit today so this blush
I am so freakin excited to try this as
those you a blush duo has this really
pretty light pink shade that one's the
flirt blush duo and then this one is a
door and it has these kind of more muted
that one looks really pretty kind of
like a muted mauve almost I think I want
to try this more neutral one I might add
a little bit of the pink on top ooh
it has a little bit of a glow to it that
looks very subtle very natural i meanyes
a little bit of the darker shade in this
one well I like the way these blend out
I really like my blushes to be less
pigmented and then build them up because
I just find they blend out it's so much
easier and you can get a more natural
look and this is super pretty and the
packaging of this just feels really nice
and sturdy feels like really nice
quality this highlight is by JK is their
luxe pro powder pearl Luminizer remove a
sticker yes sir
okay where the heck is the pili thing
how in the heck do you get this sticker
off oh the donut shop
peppermint k-cups would not recommend
currently trying to use a bottle cap
opener to get this thing off desperate
times call for desperate measures how
freakin Lou yeah Jake at you gotta sort
that out use my Sigma fo3 the
brushes I always use my go-to brushes
are linked down below
in the description box in every video if
you ever want to know what brushes I
used so I just tapped a little bit that
in the lid
oh yeah that's pretty it actually blends
out to be a lot more settled and I was
envisioning I like that this isn't crazy
crazy pigmented because you have a
little bit of room to work with it never
I edit the amount of ooze I cut out is
actually amazing losin all rights those
I'm into I'm feeling this I really like
how you don't have to worry about
getting too much product out I almost
feel like this would be really pretty to
mix in with the loose powder if you want
that luminous kind of powder look like
the cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination because this is pretty
subtle and the way that this blends out
I don't know I feel like this could be a
pretty almost all over face powder if
you use a really big fluffy brush and
just a tiny bit of product before we
move on to eyeshadow I'm gonna set my
whole face right now I'm gonna try the
mac fix+ coconut scent I've never tried
this I love a good coconut scent oh my
god that smells heavenly it almost
smells like coconut vanilla oh I could
spray that on my face for hours can I
put this all over my body
heck yeah I'm into that scent not the
most appealing color like they could
have made this color a little more
pleasant or at least like put something
on the outside of the bottle to cover it
up I shadow I'm very excited eyes out
this is the Urban Decay Christian Liane
kaleidoscope dream I shadow palette
colors in here look oh there goes the
brush comes with this double-ended brush
the assortment of colors in here is
really appealing to me I kind of want to
use this lime green or one of the Blues
I'm thinking oh the purple tube would be
cool I'm gonna do some quick finger
swatches because I haven't tried oh my
god that taejun what does that go that
was hella soft literally felt like
butter let's do this black holy
cease these are soft look at that purple
holy crap okay I think I need to use
that purple hell yeah what do I do I
want to use all of these for any matte
shadows I think I'm gonna try to morphe
24g here's the
so I think for the Matt Browns and stuff
I'm going to use this so I'm gonna start
out with this really light peachy kind
of shade right here that's a great
transition shade with this lens I'm
gonna have to start plucking my eyebrows
yeah I'm not feeling this angle sorry
guys I'm gonna figure this out the angle
will be different in the next video I'm
gonna take my favorite brown shade
right there I love these kind of tones
whenever a palette has this gotta put it
on my eye I'm creating kind of a halo
with this apparently love the packaging
of these new pallets are coming out with
their cardboard instead but they feel so
much nicer than having that cheap
plastic II kind of feel they have a nice
weight to them okay now that I've got
those two kind of base colors on I
really don't know if I want to use the
royal blue or the purple they're both
speaking to me oh my gosh these are soft
these feel a lot softer than Urban Decay
shimmers usually are typically I would
apply a shimmery kind of shade with my
finger but with the lash extensions it's
kind of hard to get it in the place that
I want so I'm just gonna go ahead and
use a brush first okay that pigmentation
is insane for only using a brush this
also is not what I'm gonna use my finger
and just see oh my good and even with a
brush
I got did I get any full oh I don't see
any I'm gonna go back in with that brown
shade and blend out the edges really
lightly I'm just blending out those
edges with the brush that it came with
that brown mixed with the blue turned it
into like a super cool dark green almost
I think I want to use the tation touch I
feel like is that a word I'm supposed to
notation I'm use the orange matte shade
with a liner brush and kind of press
that against my lower lash line I'm
gonna blend it out with that same brown
shade I didn't have lash extensions
right now I think I would go in with
like a royal blue glitter right on the
bottom I'm so tempted or a gold could
look really cool
instead of glitter I think I'm gonna do
the wiser thing and go in with the stay
gold shade I keep throwing this brush
right in the foundation I'm gonna spray
my brush with the fix plus for this one
I definitely still have some blue on
this brush but it's making kind of a
cool
like lime green color got like peacock
eyes going right now and I'm digging it
this is gorgeous that blue shade I'm so
impressed by I feel very soft definitely
feel like the best urban decay formula
thus far Congrats Kristen those are
beautiful
I think normally I would just put it on
false lashes and I wouldn't put on
eyeliner with this kind of look bow and
try the superhero liner by it cosmetics
I don't think this is new or anything
I've just never tried this - resting
packaging this feels very soft and
smooth going on and it's going over the
shadow nice I like that the way that
that's going on reminds me of the eye
booster physician's form oh my favorite
super easy to make a wing yeah this
reminds me a lot of Physicians Formula
one I like that I would definitely use
that again gonna go with my bottom lash
mascara I think we're doing eyes I'm
moving on to lips I want to try these
NARS what are these they literally have
the smallest freaking font on planet
earth lip cover darker one is the shade
under arrest and then this one is
embarrass the moy in brass Amoy I'm
gonna do the darker one first and I
might mix in a little bit of the shade
never tried these formulas at all my
lips are pretty dry right now this is
going over really nice curious if these
dried down like liquid lipsticks or if
they're more of just like a gloss might
add a tiny bit of this lighter one just
to give it some dimension feels like
it's starting to kind of dry down I'm
gonna give it a few minutes alright so
it's been about three or four minutes
and it doesn't seem to be mattifying so
as of right now it doesn't seem like
it's a matte liquid lipstick or anything
it just is more of like a lip cream kind
of product so far it's actually not
transferring to my teeth out of
everything I think I'm most excited by
the jcat pearl Luminizer I just love how
natural this looks I do want to try
mixing this with another powder maybe
with the Maybelline fit me loose powder
the jouer blushes I'm really excited to
use these more I really want to dig into
that light pink shade sponge I really
like for under eye setting powder for
everything else I'm not that big of a
fan of it definitely excited to try this
again reminds me almost exactly the
Physicians Formula
eye booster obviously the eye shadow
palette I'm into rose water spray I want
to check the ingredients on this but I
would use out again if there's not
anything scary in here
and fix+ coconut definitely feeling the
scent of this this one I would
definitely pass on I don't feel like it
really makes sense for being kind of a
blurring stick primary typically where
you want a blur you don't want a whole
lot of glow except right here if it
actually blurred you can smooth that
texture but I didn't really feel like it
did that anywhere this one feels nice
and cooling I'm gonna keep trying this
and see what I think of it I definitely
pass on the brow gel I just wish they
made a smaller one for this one and also
I don't know I feel like I made my brows
a little bit shiny I think the older
brow gel is much better in it's under 10
bucks
this pencil though I'm really feeling I
love the shade of this it has a nice
cool tone to it but it doesn't look too
gray and it also just went on really
nice it was easy to create a shape a
nice shape so I'm gonna keep using this
one so that's everything I hope you guys
