come in
all right so today we're gonna be doing
a first impressions video I have a bunch
of new stuff to try out here I have a
new eyeshadow palette to try out some
foundation sticks a foundation stick
some weird new brushes and sponges yes
that is glitter in there so if you're
excited for this video and you enjoy
while you're watching and don't forget
to give it a thumbs up I literally
cannot say don't forget to give it any
more it just turns into one long word if
you want to see how I got this look and
when I think it's a new makeup you're in
the right place just keep watching
alright guys what's up I'm excited to be
filming this morning it's one of those
days where I'm just like in such a
filming name I don't really know what
happened with my hair today but it's
there on top of my head so this video is
actually filmed like kind of in real
time like just a few days before you
guys are seeing this all of my other
videos for the next couple weeks are
majorly pre-recorded since I'm gonna be
out of town but I feel like you'll be
able to tell the order I film these
videos because of my lash extensions
falling out as you can see they're
pretty sparse looking right now I'm just
like waiting for the multiple out so
that's what's up with the eyelashes if I
address it in every video it's because I
get comments about it in every video so
in another first impressions video I was
debating using the soap &amp;amp; Glory speed
pump and what speed plump all-day
Moisture Marvel moisturizer and I ended
up going with the spray one instead but
a few of you guys in the comments said
that this is actually balm so I want to
try it out smells legitimately like an
Orange Julius which just brings me back
to my childhood my dad and I used to
always get Orange Julius is when orange
Julie I woo feels like one of those
moisturizers that actually might be a
nice base because it has a little bit of
tackiness to it but it's drying down I'm
gonna let that kind of sit in there for
a minute and set down but then we're
gonna go with the Mac prep and prime
skin base vices I've actually never
tried this on myself when I did
freelance at Mac in college I used to
use this on other people but I don't
actually think I've ever used this on
myself so this is kind of a first
impression I like the way this
moisturizer feels okay let's go in with
this Mac stuff looks just kind of like a
lotion feels like a lotion my skin feels
nice right now it feels really nice and
prepped okay so I have some weird ass
brushes lash applicators to try out so
the first thing is the iconic London
EVO check this thing out so it's one of
those like circle brushes that we've all
seen 5000 times now because of our teeth
this has a nice grip to it I also have
these when I opened this box I was like
slightly confused not only is this like
a sillas Bunge but it has forgetten
glitter in it so it says silicon blender
and a highlighter sponge duo have a
whole video on the original sila sponge
I am NOT a fan this has a nice little
finger grip though look at that so I'm
not gonna try this to apply my
foundation because using a silicone
applicator like this just smears around
the product basically oh this one is not
silicone but it feels different than a
normal sponge so this one is the
highlighter sponge even though the shape
just looks exactly like the Real
Techniques sponge look at that glitter
though the glitter looks even cooler on
camera so I'm gonna have to let that one
but I do have like a liquid illuminator
that I want your out so I'll use that
with that then I also have another brush
so this is new by la girl they came out
with the whole brush line this is the
pro brush angled buffer brush 1:08 think
what we're gonna do is try out this
brush on one side and this brush on the
other and then I'll use this guy for
highlighting so for foundation I want to
try the iconic London foundation stick
so I have two different shades here 0
and 2 I don't know if they make a 1 but
I have 0 and 2 and I just open these
just to see the shade last night these
shades look pretty dang similar I'm
gonna go in with two just because it
looks like it has a little bit more pink
tone oh that might be too dark hold up
I think I'm actually gonna mix the two
shades in there alright going in with
the big kahuna this brush has a nice
stiffness to it I'm gonna try a little
buffer guy down here
foundation stick looks like about medium
coverage usually with this dick
foundation I like to use the Sigma f80
too so I'm going to try that on part of
this side just to see this brush is
pretty small I almost feel like I would
like this for like setting my under eye
powder something about this brush that
just blends out stick foundations so
easily I'm gonna give this brush another
shot on the forehead with this
foundation definitely prefer the Sigma
f80 to brush over either of the other
two but I'll keep trying this one with
different liquid foundations and see how
it is I'm definitely gonna be spot
concealing on top of here I don't think
it looks bad on my skin it just looks
pretty average like I don't really think
I would reach for this again but I've
definitely tried worse stick foundations
so it says this highlighting sponge can
be used wet or dry I typically have
better luck with any kind of sponges wet
I don't have a new concealer to try out
so I'm gonna spot conceal do my under
eye concealer wet this sponge and then
we'll try out a liquid highlighter since
I am gonna be using a liquid highlighter
I'm not gonna powder my under eyes yet
because when you put on a liquid you
don't want to put it on top of any kind
of powder okay so all of my concealer is
now on as I went to wet the sponge I
looked out in the mirror in my living
room in natural light and the foundation
actually looks really nice and like
glowy and moisturizing almost but
definitely more medium coverage so if
you have acne or anything you will still
need to use a spot concealer on top so
this sponge was kind of magical this is
weird
I don't know what the heck kind of
material this is but when I went to wet
it it got really nice and super soft but
I've never felt like this it feels
literally like a marshmallow like that's
exactly what it feels like a giant-ass
glittery marshmallow and the other
bizarre thing is that when I went to dry
it off with the towel and squeeze out
the water it dried almost instantly like
it's definitely still damp I can feel
that it's been wet but it dried super
super quickly so I'm curious how this
would work with foundation I do feel
like it's quite big to be a highlighting
brush not really seeing where they're
going with that I mean I'm definitely
gonna use this tip to try and blend out
highlight but to me this would be more
of a sponge for foundation like I said
it's exactly the same shape as like the
Real Techniques
and 50 other sponges like that but I
wanted to try this out because I've seen
this on Instagram and it looks insane
this is the iconic London illuminator in
the shade shine not usually super into
liquid highlighters because it just is
kind of a pain like you have to do it
before all of your powders then I feel
like when you powder your concealer
sometimes it like covers the highlight
just kind of a whole thing that I
usually try to avoid but I'm really
curious about this so I guess I'm gonna
drop some on a pallet and then just dip
my sponge in and I'm just gonna use the
tip of this and kind of like squeeze it
down so it's smaller alright let's see
with this sponge it actually looks
pretty natural I want to try it with
just my fingers on the other side I
don't know I feel like it's looking
pretty similar with the sponge and my
finger it doesn't look quite as intense
as I was envisioning but it looks really
nice I just for me I don't think I would
reach for this so I just set everything
set my under eyes with my usual and then
set my face laura geller balance and
brighten this one with the stick
foundation looks really nice right now
so I have two different brow products I
want to try from our gel one is stroke
of brow feathering pen which sounds like
it could be right up my alley because I
love the makeup from a pen I always use
on the front to get like the hair
strokes and then this one is the brow
confidential brow duo let's see what
this brow duo looks like this looks like
a powder kind of thing and then there's
a clear brow gel on the other end the
feathering appendages it looks like a
liquid eyeliner and that's usually what
I like for doing the front of my brows
but not the entire brow this I'm not
into I don't even want to attempt to do
this powder thing okay so instead of the
powdery thing I'm gonna try out the
Burberry Eponine effortless eyebrow
definer pencil this is kind of just like
an angled pencil I think I've liked
swatch this before maybe put this on my
eyebrows a while ago but I don't think
I've actually full-on tried it well
whenever I try and do my eyebrows in a
close-up mirror I mess em up for
whatever reason I feel like I'm hardcore
struggling on this brow right now I'm
gonna go back in and carve this out with
concealer because I have like no brows
skill right now I like that brow pencil
I don't feel like I have quite as much
control as I do with one like the
benefit
I see my brow but I'm gonna go over with
the older brow tint and deep this isn't
my first impression I always use this
just to warm up the shade of it add some
Brown in there hopefully you can't hear
at the hammering going on or whatever
that is I just carved them out with
concealer and now we're gonna try out
the stroke the brow so this is the
feathering pen thing from ardell I'm
just going to use this right on the
front to kind of draw on some lines
whoo I like that one why is it not
coming up okay what the heck you just
use that on one eyebrow and it's like
not coming out now I think there is a
little bit of something going on with
this applicator never mind about that
I'll be sticking with my makeup forever
I think those brows literally just took
me like a half hour
so just primed my eyes with my go-to Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot cuz I want her out
this new morphe 35o 2 palette apparently
they're like fully changed in their logo
the box that this came in was also a lot
nicer than the previous boxes I don't
know if they're doing like a rebranding
but the actual packaging is the same
kind of cheapy plastic that the
eyeshadow pallete packaging doesn't feel
any different so they have all the shade
names on the plastic overlay here are
the colors very fall we have some
shimmers and some matte shades in there
no idea what look I want to go for right
now I'm gonna start out with this shade
Universal and put it in the crease
looking for the brush that's been in my
hand for five minutes
kind of want to do like super orange but
then with this pop of like light gold
this shade looks really pretty last year
I feel like fall went by literally in
like a day so this year I'm really
trying to embrace it we're in all the
fall colors I got pumpkins in my
apartment got some fall photos ready to
go for Instagram you know what I'm
saying I've been actually really into
Instagram lately
when I stopped doing my gray black white
kind of themed thing when was that in
the summer I got kind of out of it the
theme keeps you going
digging with a theme and trying to get
like actual good photos is kind of a fun
challenge my Instagram is the Tayla it's
the same as everything else except
snapchat my snapchats the tail is snaps
someone took the Tayla I'm gonna go in
with this super matte orange shade
whoops that one right there mm-hmm I
think I literally just got the chills oh
look at that shade or some putting this
on about the outer third look at that
friggin Orange and I'm gonna take this
shade right here
I like how even though there's names I'm
just pointing to them that one is orb am
i doing with this I think I'm gonna put
that like kind of on the first third and
do kind of a
two-toned halo is that a thing it's
almost looks like a candy corn comment
down below if you are team candy corn or
if you don't like candy corns I feel
like candy corns are very polarizing I
am personally a candy corn fan now I'm
gonna blend out the edges with the same
brush there's a little bit left of that
color on there now with my finger I'm
going to take that gold shade I
mentioned called pure and put that right
on the center now I'm gonna go in with
that shade right there brick and just
kind of blend that together a little bit
the gold you could totally do not wet
but I just want an extra pop so I'm
gonna go in with a little bit more of
the gold on a wet brush oh yeah
I take the bright orange shade again and
put that on the lower lash line for
water line eyeliner and winter I want to
get lucky gel liner by our dell in teddy
looks like just brown eyeliner oh it
looks like there's a built-in sharpener
in the lid that's nice see how this does
on the waterline that's gliding on there
pretty well I'm also gonna bring it down
so I can smoke out the bottom lash line
a bit now to blend that out I'm gonna
take which Brown don't want to go in
with I think I actually want like deeper
I'm gonna take this Brown right here
okay see where they have the sharp der
bilt in because look at the point the
points already gone so it is pretty soft
now I'm gonna go in with a spice right
here just to blend out that line I think
this palette has like every possible
warm brown shade you could probably want
but there isn't really a light shimmery
shade so there's not something for the
inner corner so I'm probably just going
with whatever I use as a face highlight
or maybe we'll try the illuminator thing
yeah let's do that I'm gonna go back in
with this and let's just see how it does
is an inner corner highlight you can
always add a powder on top if it's not
quite enough pretty again pretty subtle
so I'll probably add something on top of
that still but let's try out this liquid
eyeliner so this is the fame tracer
liquid liner by Ardell and espresso
espresso
I think espresso is one of the most
controversial words on you
literally any time you say it wrong
people come out of the Woodworks only
putting false lashes on I'm not sure if
I want to do a full-on wing but I'm
definitely gonna line my eyes with this
this looks straight-up black doesn't it
I've been liking the look lately of not
doing a wing and just kind of like
smudging it out so I think I'm gonna
leave it like that and then go back over
it with a deep brown shadow and kind of
smudge formula this was okay it's a
little bit draggy like where you get the
little jagged lines if you just kind of
drag it across so you do have to work
with a little bit it's also one of those
that doesn't totally cover the shimmer
and take the deepest brown shade right
here and just kind of stamp this on top
of there and also bring it out a tiny
bit once we have the false lashes on you
won't you'll be able to see the end of
this really because the lashes will be
covering it if you can see a difference
it's just kind of softening it really
nice I'm gonna finish up the eyes with
false lashes and everything in a second
but I didn't have a new bronzer or blush
to try out so I just went in with the
bare minerals and visible bronze and a
fair - light there it is in the pan and
then for blush I went in with the NYX
baked blush right here this is in the
shade chiffon I do have a new highlight
to try out which I'm really curious
about this is by Becca and it's the
gradient glow shimmer Perfector look at
the inside oh my gosh this is very
exciting I feel like I might be able to
use this light shade as an inner corner
highlight I don't know if I want to just
do a swirl of all the shades I kind of
do because I feel like with these eyes I
just want to warm up my face and give it
almost like a bronzy kind of highlight I
think I'm just gonna try swirling all of
them let's do this very powdery ooh by
the way I feel like that highlighter the
illuminator underneath you can't really
see you now that I have all the powder
and stuff on that is super pretty mixed
all together okay that highlight I am
feelin I'm gonna go in with just the
light shade right here for my Cupid's
bow nose I'm also going to take that on
my finger
and elizabeth's on the inner corner this
setting spray has been sitting in my
drawer to try out since physicians for
me launched this thing this is their
insta ready setting spray so it's a
super fine mister but it's also very
wide I literally just got my entire
shirt and my legs all at the same time
and my face if you don't want to get
your entire body you just have to get
really close to your face
has a nice light kind of fresh scent not
super overpowering whoa okay so my body
is like sticky from that setting spray I
can feel it on my arm my arm is like
sticking together so I'm gonna put on
some false lashes do my lower lash
mascara and I'll be right back okay so
lashes are on I tried out the BH Studio
Pro em 202 and I really like these I
like how they're kind of wispy but
they're still dramatic and the band
feels super light like I can barely feel
these on my eyes and I'm pretty sure the
BH lashes are super affordable
like everything else BH lips I had about
5 different products in this box that I
was debating between trying out but none
of them I feel like are vampy enough for
this I want to do like a really deep lip
so I think what I'm gonna do is go in
with pur cosmetics addicted one of my
favorite bampi colors and then this one
is new this is the color pop My Little
Pony ultra glossy lip and flutter valley
looks like a gold shimmery kind of thing
so I might try these two together
but first let's going with pure the
shade hello yeah this is definitely one
of my favorite deep deep liquid
lipsticks because the shade I feel like
it's so unique it's a deep red but
there's also a lot of purple in there I
don't know I'm kind of just feeling this
lip like the match do I want to put this
over top so they're just watch it is
pretty metallic I think that might be
too much with the eyes but look at that
I don't know I'm tempted but I also
think it might be overboard I think
we're gonna skip it this time around
alright so this is the final look I
think out of everything I'm most into
these eyelashes feeling them this
highlight pleasantly surprised me I just
usually not that excited about Becca
highlighters but this one is freakin
beautiful I did try and use this on my
chest oh my
collarbone and I had to wipe it off
because it looked way too dark on my
chest
and then also the 3502 palette I mean I
think it turned out beautiful I love
that matte orange shade there are 5,000
warm toned palettes out right now so I
don't think this is like an absolute
must if you already have a few in your
collection but formula leaves were
really nice blended out easily super
pigmented and I would definitely use it
again the brow products I used aligners
and stuff I think I would pass on the
Physicians Formula insta ready setting
spray out try out again so hope you guys
