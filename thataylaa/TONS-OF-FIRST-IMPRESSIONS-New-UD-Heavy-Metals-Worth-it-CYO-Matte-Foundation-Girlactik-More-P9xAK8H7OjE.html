right now
all right so today we're doing a first
impressions video this is almost a
full-face I think everything except
concealer and brows were first
impression got a mix of drugstore in
here high-end I'm excited some new
palettes and things I feel like you
could wear this look for the holidays
even for like Thanksgiving if you just
changed up the lip color did like kind
of a brick red color or even a nude or
something to wear if you celebrate
Christmas Valentine's Day you could even
wear this just a casual Wednesday night
whatever your heart desires I just
wanted to say before you jump in thank
you to you guys for the response on the
acne story video I was not expecting
that and the comments and everything on
that video we're just so personal and
heartfelt and I really appreciate them
all I just love you guys what else do
they want to say there was something
else so if you enjoyed this video while
you're watching don't forget to give it
a thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby dough family and subscribe
the button is right there it's red let's
get into it if you want to see my
thoughts on some new makeup and how I
got this look you're in the right place
just keep watching this feels like old
school YouTube right now I've got the
leopard robe on we got the candles
burning in the background I'm excited to
film I just got back in from California
last night we have a ton of first
impressions here I'm gonna start out
with the LA girl Pro sponge blending
sponge I've already dampened one and you
can see how much bigger got it this
feels nice has a nice density to it but
it still feels soft and squishy I've
already washed and moisturize my face I
have two different primers I want to try
I think I'm gonna actually use them both
the first is the amazing cosmetics
illuminating primer so the shades glow
and Rose I think glow is more of a white
here they are I don't know which one I
want to go and with it says you can also
use these on their own so I'm thinking
on like no makeup makeup days if you
just want kind of a glow you could use
these which I usually do put on a little
bit of highlighter when I'm not wearing
foundation it just makes your skin look
a little bit healthier I can't even see
that to both the Rose and the white I
mean you can't really see I'm just go in
with this white one as a primary
probably put my hair behind my ears I'm
using the wider angle lens right now
which a lot of you guys said that you
liked in the acne story video oh this is
accentuating all the bores but anyways
this is the same lens I used in that
video and it just feels so much nicer
for me to record a fit because the
cameras sitting on a tripod on my desk
right now and just feels so much more
personal and I feel like it's more like
relaxed and I can just talk easier do
you guys if you do videos you probably
know it I mean sometimes like the
smallest changes make such a difference
and I don't have the monitor on and it
just feels more cash interesting I just
feel like I have an illuminator all over
my face and then the other primer I want
to try is this Smashbox stick primer
this is the photo finish iconic primer
stick it says 12-hour oil control I'm
only on day six of accutane right now
when I'm filming this so I'm still
getting pretty oily I'm not like super
super dry yet or anything
oh nice matte black packaging I'm just
gonna put this on my t-zone it looks
like it's just a clear stick feels a bit
silicon e says instantly blurts pores
and imperfections while eliminating
shine for 12 hours lightweight and non
drying my pores are pretty emphasized
right now from that illuminating thing
so let's see if this helps at all I'm
just gonna kind of tap it in there I
think that just did something can't
really tell definitely looks more matte
on my forehead then we're the
illuminator is so in the CYO video I
told you guys I would try out this
foundation the other one that I didn't
use this is the matte foundation no
shine zone and 2:03 I don't know this is
gonna be light enough I might have to
mix it with something but the CYO
long-lasting foundation the lifeproof
foundation I used in that video I want
to give you guys a quick update on this
because I've been really liking this I
brought this with me to California and I
used it almost every day either by
itself or mixed in with stuff it's
really nice it doesn't have quite the
coverage I like so I do like to mix it
in with something to add a little bit of
coverage alright here we go
Oh a sponge feels super soft this
foundation smells like play-doh or
something holy that has great
coverage this one is supposed to be more
full coverage than the lifeproof shade
is definitely too dark so it would have
to make this very matte but sitting on
my skin pretty nice it's not like
looking cakey even with this sponge and
I'm liking the way this sponge feels by
the way I just want to do the other side
with a sponge too because I really like
how that applied and I feel like the
brush with this one my
be a little much with that coverage I
haven't forgetten zit right on my
eyebrow that pumpkin candle back there
smells so bomb it's trying to read
backwards it's vanilla vanilla pumpkin
from Target okay besides the shade with
just a couple of shades too dark this
looks really nice especially around my
pores could have been the primary - my
skin looks very smooth not really
emphasizing my texture anywhere CYO is
kind of gutted down with the foundations
just gonna add a tiny bit right here my
acne definitely full coverage great
coverage it is so cold in my apartment
right now but I've been procrastinating
putting on the heat because I realized
it's right behind that standing mare in
my living room which means I basically
have to reorganize the whole living room
so I Chi said I don't have a concealer
first impression so I'm just gonna go in
with the Maybelline fit me in 15 this
one is a little bit dark so since my
foundation is too dark right now it
won't be too stark of a difference think
I'm gonna put this on center of my face
to just lighten and brighten everything
up I'm surprised la girl isn't a Nolte
yet feel like Ulta is kind of killing it
lately with the brands you know you know
when you press over your eyes sometimes
and you can hear it like moving such as
me my skin looks working good right now
when I bought this there was only four
shades of this I now have six shades of
this one but two or three is still the
lightest shade I'm guessing they're
gonna expand it if it says 203 I picked
this up from Ulta it's technically like
a Halloween product but it's a white
powder so I picked it up this is the
makeup revolution ghost powder you guys
know I've used this stargazer powder for
years now it's just a white pressed
powder for setting my under eye
concealer especially if I have a
concealer that's too dark it just really
helps to lighten and brighten everything
under there I've been mixing it in
lately with a darker part of the
Physicians Formula powder so that's what
I'm gonna do with this one just because
this is gonna be way too light
especially right now with this shade how
the heck do you open this
oh so this just slides out like that
let's watch this looks pretty
translucent actually when you blend it
out I'm just gonna mix that with my
Physicians Formula powder so the under
eye is the ghosts powder doesn't have
quite as much pigment
as the stargazer putter that one is like
a white powder this is kind of like a
translucent powder with a little bit of
a white tint to it which could be nice
if you don't want that stark white
so that foundation dries down to a
powder finish it feels super nice
definitely don't have to set my face
with this one so I don't have a brow
product for a first impression that was
the other thing
concealer brows so I'm just gonna pop on
a my usual I guess I'll show you guys
because why not lately I've been using
the Benefit cabro product in five but
first I'll go in with the OL tip brow
tint and deep this just fills them in
majorly so I just have to use less of
the benefit and just do less work
basically I don't put this right on the
front because I like it to be kind of
lighter on the front sometimes I get
questions about why I put on brow
products over my permanent brows and
it's because when I put on foundation it
kind of covers them up a little bit you
could definitely go on with the q-tip
and like clean it up but I just prefer
to add a bit more shape and color to
them I still love the permanent brows
especially when I'm not wearing makeup
it's amazing I don't touch my brows at
all they look great when I'm not wearing
makeup cuz they're dark enough I just
plucked my brows this morning for you
guys then I go in with my makeup forever
brow liner in the shade 40 I just love
drawing on a few lines in the beginning
it just makes it look like your brow
hairs there I have a few things from
Gerlach dick to try this as their matte
bronzer I'm super excited because I've
never tried anything from burlock dick
this isn't the shade Cobo and this looks
like a nice tone look at that tone so
I'm excited I'm gonna use my flower
Beauty brush right here oh heck yeah I'm
curious to see how this looks when I
don't have dark foundation on this brush
is so freakin soft sometimes they'll
bring bronzer up to my temples sometimes
I don't I'm not really feeling it today
definitely gonna keep using this one try
it again
so this is the BH floral blush in the
shade Caribbean curl curl coral I've
tried a different shade of this and kind
of used as like a bronzer I think
actually in a video but I've never tried
this shade still has the plastic steal
thing on it I liked the other one so
we'll see how this has a little bit of
coral and pink in it looks like ooh
that's pretty
have we had a dud yet we haven't had a
dead product yet this is rare I'm liking
this shade not to Coral once there's not
a whole lot
a product left on the brush I always
kind of just blend it together with the
bronzer this I'm super curious about so
this is the ultra beauty baked eye
lighter three-piece wet/dry highlighter
palette I believe this is a new product
I was just scrolling through Ulta I
needed to get more eyelashes I ran out
of him and ended up picking this up so
there's three different highlight shades
in here I feel like you can actually see
it the product really well right now my
taking my Sigma fo 3 this brushes on for
highlighting and I think I'm gonna go in
with skylight I might add a little bit
of this pink shade Gold definitely looks
too dark for my skin tone but I'm gonna
take skylight first that's pretty dang
look at that this on my nose
it is emphasizing my texture a little
bit but I still like it like I would
still use this again if you have a lot
of texture in this area you might not
like this I'm gonna switch brushes I'm
gonna take the more p.m. 510 go in with
starlight which is that pink shade and
just blend this a little bit lower just
to create like a glowy kind of blush
topper those intense this is very rare
that I feel like at this point we don't
have something that I don't like I
always prime my eyes with Mac's Paint
Pot in soft ochre I'm just gonna put
that on the only thing with this lens is
I can't zoom for eyes I have two
different palettes here that I'm
debating trying I don't know which one I
want to go in with I'm kind of leaning
towards the Urban Decay heavy metals
I'll show you the Becca one this is the
Becca ski something what's this cold ski
globe collection highlights pellet the
packaging this is beautiful look at this
thing this makes me so excited for
winter I don't think I'm gonna try this
out today because I feel like I've done
a lot of looks lately with these colors
I think I want to do like a cranberry
kind of I check out this packaging whoa
this thing weighs probably 10 pounds so
all of these are limited edition 20 of
our most amped up metallic shadows yet
every single one is new and exclusive so
that's kind of cool
sometimes Urban Decay puts in past
shadows in their palace but these are
all apparently new knocking light took
me like five minutes to figure out how
to open this palette last night and
turns out you sorry this is like
blinding you all you do is press one
side and it comes out feel like that is
pretty unique but you kind of to be
careful because it just slides right out
as you can see
there you guys are so here's the shades
I'm thinking I want to go in with the
combo of like the red in this magenta
ish shade right here that's what I'm
leaning towards oh we need some matte
shadows gently I'm gonna actually take
the bronzer and put this into my crease
I'm going to take my Coastal Scents BR
250 and use that same bronzer shade but
since this is kind of a more compact
brush it'll help just create a little
bit more dimension blend it all out oh
that looks nice feels super soft you
this is the shade after party I think
I'm just gonna use my finger first to
place it now that I have some on the lid
I'm gonna go in with the flat shader
brush and spray it you could just use
water or setting spray wet it and then
go back in and I'm gonna place it a
little bit higher doesn't look that
different wet than it does dry oh but
you definitely can pack this on to make
it more intense there we go
I'm gonna go with the brown metallic
shade right under it Rodie and just
layer that a bit like that one isn't
showing up a whole lot on top of the red
it's not showing up but there's the
color on its own ooh pretty
let's try funk-rock that's that purplish
shade I mentioned earlier again on top
of the red it's pretty subtle I want to
put like a warm Brown kind of purply
color into the crease so I'm gonna go
with the Urban Decay Naked Ultima basics
I'm gonna take this shade lethal right
here put that in the outer V I think I
want to go in with extra bitter right
here just to blend those together a bit
blending again with the big fluffy brush
you guys see just cut down to like two
seconds but really I spend like three
minutes doing this properly and you can
see the difference between the blended
side and the not blended side so I have
a couple of the heavy metal glitter
liners this in the shade catcall and
grind I think I'm gonna take catcall and
just put this actually all over the lid
to turn it into like glitter eyeshadow I
love doing that with glitter liners
because then you'd have to deal with the
fallout of glitter they just stick on so
oh that's so pretty
I'm gonna put this pretty much all over
the lid dude that shade I'm seeing a
little bit of
purple periwinkle there's a word for
that color and it's super pretty I have
this black magic liquid liner plus wide
lash and no idea what that is supposed
to be no features wide lash a
conditioning try peptide complex
designed to enhance the appearance of
eyelashes with up to three times more
length of volume in 15 days that's a big
claim this is by eyeko looks a little
bit gray not like the blackest black
even on the areas where I'm not putting
it over glitter because I know that can
affect it sometimes braiding the point
everything is fine and it feels nice and
smooth gliding over it's just not that
blood I'm actually going to go over that
line with my Kat Von D liner
I'm gonna try out this Maybelline
lasting drama waterproof gel pencil
well-kept just like flew off Oh a need
coffee I'm sitting here for like an hour
now
whew okay that just went on so easy this
reminds me of the LA girl glide on gel
pencil I love super black I'm gonna pull
that a little bit down because I'm gonna
do some smudging with the Browns and
reds go back in with lethal right here
on a flat edged brush I'm just gonna
kind of stamp this right under that line
I'm gonna go back in with extra bitter
and just kind of blend that blue I'm
gonna add a touch of the bronzer again I
was gonna go in with angel fire right
here for the inner corner but I just
kind of did a finger swatch and it feels
pretty chalky let's take grind instead
going all in with the glitter right
there I want to bring this right on the
inner corner yeah let's do it
feel like I need a little bit more
smokiness down here so I'm going in with
blackjack in the same Impella so I'm
gonna be putting on false lashes but I
won't try out this mascara this is the
black magic mascara hopefully this is
blacker than the eyeliner quill
packagings like squeeze tube I don't
know how to describe this it feels very
lightweight this one for me I think
might be a good layering one because it
is doing a good job of separating and it
looks pretty natural and kind of wispy I
liked a little bit more volume I'm gonna
go back in with the highlighting palette
it might make starlight and skylight
there we go
to brighten it up a little oh yeah cuz
every one of my go-to lashes the aisle
or 120 ones this is why I was on Ulta in
the first place that worded like four
more of these but I also kind of want to
try the BH m203 lashes I want to take
these out and just see kind of what
these would look like they're pretty
short but they have voluminous base
going on these are very short these
might look good though with this oh I
like those okay I'm gonna try these
alright so I put on the false lashes and
then I also put on my bottom mascara I
feel like these lashes I would love when
I'm wearing no eyeliner anything because
they look very nice and like short and
natural they still give you that volume
at the base but if you have smaller eyes
or if you have issues with lashes being
too long you might really like these
lashes so for liquid lipstick I want to
try out the girl
dick matte lip paint never tried these
this is in the shade seductive looks
like a nice berry color let's see oh
this might be too reddish
I might actually do this and then tap
one of those eye shadows like the purple
on top yeah that's we're gonna do ooh
that smells good oh that's actually
pretty purple okay okay that's actually
exactly the color I was going for so I
don't think I'm gonna add anything on
top that is so pretty I like that but
this is the final look I'm gonna tell
you my favorite and least favorite just
off of first impressions so I'm
definitely gonna try this foundation
again if you're into super matte and
super full coverage it looks beautiful
it doesn't look heavy doesn't want cakey
it looks very smooth and I feel like I
can kind of see the illuminating primer
coming through I don't know how I feel
about that probably wouldn't use that
primer again if I did it would just be
on like the high points of my face not
as an all-over primer this one I would
have to mix or light and if I wear it
again
she's obviously down side CYO should
come out with more shades obviously
don't know how this is gonna wear
throughout the day yet but right now
it's looking great the bronzer I'm very
excited about I want to use this again I
just really like the tone of it blend it
out easily it's beautiful as eyeshadow
as well the blush I would use again the
sponge I would definitely use again I
feel like there were a lot of hits in
this one this I would probably pass on I
just like the stargazer a bit better
this one I'm kind of on the fence about
just because I feel like for me
emphasize texture but I think a lot of
people would love this especially if you
don't have a lot of texture pores right
there I think I would probably pass on
this palette I mean I like the way my
eyes turned out but I just feel like I
have other similar shades I mean Jay Kat
makes great metallic eyeshadows there's
a similar cranberry shade I think the
packaging would be pretty hit or miss
for a lot of people just depending on
what you like I think this could get a
little bit scary I feel like I would
drop this with shit-ton shades I used
I'm not super excited about I think
they're pretty doable matchbox primer
stick I would have to try some more I do
feel like my pores look pretty nice and
smooth right now it could be the
foundation could be the primer stick
lipstick has now dried down and it feels
really nice doesn't feel overly drying
or anything and it feels really nice and
kind of creamy almost going on but still
thin Maybelline liner I'd wear again
this one on so nice on the waterline and
like one swipe I think that's everything
but not misses just a Victoria Secret
it's actually just bralette this will be
linked down below if they still make it
watch everything will be linked
down below I feel like this lipstick
color makes your teeth look really white
maybe it's just because my face is more
tan than usual that is everything if you
