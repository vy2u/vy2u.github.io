holy-shit sees the solar eclipse is
going down right now watching the nasa
livestream raise your hand if you forgot
to buy glasses and now the entire
country is sold out
right so it's going to do a shadow and
schmooze today and I had a bunch of deep
topics that I wanted to talk to you guys
about and then I woke up and I just
wasn't wasn't in the mindset I almost
filmed it last night so I was like
totally in the zone and my mind was
going 500 miles per hour but today
instead I'm just going to be doing a
bunch of first impressions this is
almost like a full-face such a few
products that aren't but pretty much
full phase first impressions so if you
like this video while you're watching
don't forget to give it a thumbs up you
want to see how I got this look and when
I think of a bunch of new stuff in the
right place just keep watching ok so
I've already primed my face using the
Smashbox photo finish primer Iser this
is their new primer plus moisturizer
two-in-one situation and has hyaluronic
acid in it I've used this one time
before and I can't really tell what I
think of it yet it just feels kind of
like very average it's like a thin gel
kind of moisturizer doesn't feel super
tacky or anything but for my face I want
to try out this kula SPF 30 BB cream I
love the color of this box it says it
has an never mind not good read that a
lot of rose stem cells help boost
your naturally luminescent glow and
support fresh healthy looking skin it
does it has sheer tinged coverage so I'm
going to mix in some of the cover FX
custom cover drops in with this just add
some coverage I have the shade n 10
weight first I wanted to use a second
primer so I want your at the model's own
safe space this is like a silicon primer
it looks like face primer smooth cuts
and primes does on here that it's
mattifying as well whoa okay you got to
shake that for sure it just did that
thing that mustard does where it's like
a stream of yellow liquid winning first
squirt it out wow that was a really
appealing comparison and it's flying all
over
I'm not even squeezing it that can't be
the formula no it looks like there's
more like solid gel at the bottom but I
just can't get it to mix it what the
heck it looks like it almost separated
in there
alright I've been trying to mix this
thing for like two minutes and I can't
get it to come out right so I'm going to
be returning this thing so instead let's
try this Urban Decay primer this is our
urban defense complexion primer this
also has SPF 30 in it
as house it really is going to say if n
consistency but also really interesting
scent
whoa this feels like oil it feels like
I'm putting straight-up oil on my face
this mix geez Elise I don't really like
the formula this I feel like it might
make me
earlier throughout the day but if you
have dry skin might work for you
it does feel like it's starting to kind
of set in a little bit it just feels
super greasy let's try out this clueless
situation that looks so friggin dark
what the heck there's no way this is the
light medium this is the light medium
shade all right I'm going to shake this
that seems to be a theme of the day well
the cover of X drops do definitely help
to lighten does have a really nice glass
bottle cruelty free vegans let's get
some coverage going with the cover of X
traps I need to get a new bottle list I
want to try out this beauty blender look
at this thing so pretty it looks like a
friggin Easter eggs
I've already dampened it I think just
was there like Anniversary Collection
summer collection exclusive just for
whatever it is let's try the sponge on
one side of my face so that BB cream
must be very mattifying because
typically the cover effects drops are
pretty luminous and the side of my face
right now is like pretty matte I think
there's going to use this on my face is
like how it's going onto sponge even
though the BB cream is too dark it has a
nice beige tone to it for some reason I
thought it was going to smell like
coconut definitely doesn't I'm getting
pretty good coverage I'm going to layer
on a little bit just over my acne if we
can build it up it looks really nice I
definitely could still go over some of
my acne spots with spot concealer down
on my neck wish I would do I would
definitely wear those two mixed again my
forehead looks really nice and smooth
pleasantly surprised by that combo and
trying to get better about getting the
foundation off my hair so for concealer
this is one that I've tried once or
twice before and I really did not like
so this is kind of like the final chance
for this guy this is a soft matte
complete concealer in the shade vanilla
this is a fairly new concealer a lot of
people love this I just can't get it to
work for me but I'm going to try it
again today and see if we can get it to
do better
think of me use this as like a spot
concealer cameron's once I've tried this
sore spot concealing the shades vanilla
is matching my face makeup perfectly
right now Chantilly is a little bit too
light for underneath my eyes which as I
got vanilla and I can always lighten up
my under-eye concealer with my
Physicians Formula powders on YouTube so
it's working nicely a spot concealer and
that shade is pretty perfect Villette
shadows for underneath the eyes
one more time it does feel very
lightweight not super thick or anything
like you would think kind of a pop
concealer would be I just don't get that
grade of coverage at all and it is
already starting to crease yeah not
quite enough coverage for what I like
underneath my eyes but I might keep this
as a spot concealer because like I said
that matches really well underneath the
eyes if you like it's in but kind of
creamy moisturizing consistency I would
say a medium coverage you might like
that it just kind of set underneath my
eyes who catches creased so bad there's
like one two three
peddler I'm trying out a new Smashbox
brushes this is the full coverage
foundation brush mmm do not like that
concealer underneath my eyes have this
loose powder by pixi to try out this is
their quick fix translucent setting
powder
this has like a puffs built into it kind
of looks like a macaroon
you guys know my sauce on translucent
powders by this point but I'm going to
give it a go some of them work out I
always want to find one that works they
just never work for my skin it always
just takes away the coverage and makes
my skin look really bad wow this has a
mirror on the top I'm also kind of
scared to use this because I really like
how my skin looks right now like the
rest of my face makeup looks good
especially my forehead so maybe I'll
just set my cheek area or something with
this this has like a green tint to it
what the heck and where's the puff it
doesn't look like you get a lot of
powder in here at all this is kind of
messy so there's powder in the bottom of
this thing I think it goes through the
puffs okay take off the sealant we're
going to screw this puff back on sets
makeup no color wears imperfections tap
pass onto skin to release powder
nothing's coming out right now what the
heck man it doesn't look like anything's
coming out I mean there's the hole
should be going through when you like
really shake it there's a little bit
coming out but not nearly enough that
you would need to set yeah like
nothing's coming out you do not like
what that just did so I'm going to
actually unscrew the puffs because the
class is a no-go when you use the bottom
of my morphe sponge for this this is a
dry sponge it actually fits in there
perfectly
what just happened down there the
concealer just awesome
unless you guys can see that but there's
like dark circles around where I spot
concealed all right back in with this
blue powder let's put this on chin it
has a blue tint to it this is bizarre
it's not looking particularly smooth now
that definitely looks worse it's like
emphasizing my texture a bit so I'm
definitely not going to use that on the
rest of my face and it has this bizarre
blue tint to it almost I'm going to take
the damp sponge and see if I'm kind of
smooth it out I don't have any new brow
products to test out so I'm just going
to pop them on really quick to contour
we're going to try this step-by-step
contour kit by Smashbox as there's a
contour bronze in the highlight super
small packaging the Box makes this look
like a family a huge palette ooh that
light shade right there it looks like it
might be nice whoo why do my lips look
like they're about to peel off for now
oh hell yeah why do I feel like it looks
warmer on this side what if I had some
left over on the brush or something so
it looks way warmer on this side looks
nice and cool tones when I swatch it
whoo I don't know what's going on I'm
gonna have to use this again and see
because I really like how it looks on
this side but for whatever reason when I
put it on this side my face even with a
different brush like 50 times warmer
memory sorry just got bold but I just
put on blush and highlight off-camera
since these aren't first impressions
these Physicians Formula butter blush
and natural glow and then my holy grail
if you haven't bought this yet you need
to go get it
Physicians Formula natural nude
highlight it is one of the most
beautiful highlighters on planet Earth
so for eyes I have two different eye
shadow things I want to try out the
versus the Smashbox cover shot palette
and then the other is the Physicians
Formula anniversary palette so I think
that's what these are called i shadow
quad so this looks pretty what's those
colors so I'm kind of tempted to just
use this my eyes I think are good to go
I brought that concealer on top of them
and instead it still my travel makeup
bag here that is not and passed yet so
my brushes are like all over the place
it's actually not like a transition
shade in there so I'm going to go back
in with the shade that we use for
contour and just put that in the crease
see it's looking cool tone here my
favorite thing ever so as I kind of want
to go on this fuchsia color now let's do
it
I don't really know where I'm putting
this right now I do in a halo why what's
going on yeah let's do it I'm gonna go
with this brick shade right here put
that a little bit higher than the future
think let's blend that up I think I want
to pop that Warren G kind of gold shade
on the lid I'm just going to take my
finger first oh that's like very orange
okay whoa very orange I mean it's pretty
I just don't know if I was going for
that orange today I'm probably going to
pop a different shade on top of it oh my
back feels like a deep crack this top
shade right here looks like it might be
a little bit more what I was going for
so those are pretty layered I don't want
that future to get lost with all the
blending so I'm just going back in and
adding a little bit more I'm sure and
wet the gold shade and see if I can get
it to pop a little bit more there we go
much better I think I do want to add
some eyeliner to the waterline so we're
going to put on this black ones by
Catrice and kind of feel in the
waterline eyeliner lately so I'm going
to take that deep brown shade in here
which we having is yet I'm just stamping
that on pressing it really close to my
lashline I typically don't like Smashbox
shadows I find them to be a little bit
too stiff but these ones are working
really well I'm just blending that out
with whatever's left over on this brush
by the inner corner highlight on my eyes
I'm going to use my same position
formula that I used on the face and just
take this light kind of champagne gold
color okay this thing is probably what
I'm most excited to try out this is the
lottery London wing woman felt tip
eyeliner Casey Holmes raved about this
so I am really excited to try this I can
get it open I didn't want coffee what am
i doing literally had three sips if
there could be an IV that would just put
caffeine in my body as I filmed that
would be great alright hallelujah let's
do this Lottie we're going to wing it
out eh the wing guards so it's very
black very matte the thing that I
personally don't like is I don't know if
you guys would see me kind of struggling
to get a straight line across here it's
on those eyeliners that kind of
skids on the top if you try and just
drag it so you have to use the actual
point to go in and get a really smooth
line one of the things I love about the
positions where my eye booster is that I
can literally just drag it across and it
makes the easiest to move this line it's
almost good now that I was able to
smooth out that line but I wouldn't say
this is like a beginner kind of eyeliner
it's not super easy whew that one just
got wild me it's one of those eye learns
that because of the jagged lines it kind
of just keeps getting bigger because you
have to keep smoothing over it the wings
are a little intense today what I'm
planning on wearing false lashes but I
think now I'm going to because these are
just a little much for no falsies I'm
still going to try out this mascara this
is the urban decay troublemakers brand
new it says on the box super fat super
long sex proof mascara I can see the
clickbait coming now I don't even want
to know what first impressions people
are going to do on this one that's why I
love the packaging on this super pretty
unique mascara packaging looks like a
comb kind of applicator so I'm going to
do a coat before going in with false
lashes to see houses not that very
lengthening and separating it's not
giving me any volume relief not my new
favorite but I also don't not like it
yeah
don't not like it do double negatives
confuse anyone else because those
they're like a total mine but for me I
don't know what it is about them alright
so I put on lashes and lower lash line
mascara I use the Ardell so mink lashes
for the first time I really like these
very lightweight but still like fluttery
feeling them I feel like with this warm
eye shadow lift I need to warm up my
face a little bit more so I think I'm
actually going to go back in with that
contour palette but use that shade a
little bit try out this brush with Ickx
I don't like a light dusting
that's pretty so this thing is really
interesting this is by pretty vulgar
cosmetics and it's their silent
treatment matte lip moisturizer which
clearly I need today so I think just
just put this on under like a matte
liquid lipstick or maybe under any kind
of lipstick it does feel moisturizing
but it's looking totally matte it was
really nice on the lip doesn't have the
best smell kind of smells like chemicals
so I kind of have two different lip
products I want her out the first is the
models own matte liquid lipstick I
haven't tried too
yet and then the Sephora let powder I
hold this in my Sephora and clothing
hall I want kind of like a bright but
fuchsia kind of color ooh that is
literally exactly what this is this is
in the color candy cane oh hell yeah
this is like the exact color is going
for it's actually looking a little bit
more red on camera in real life it looks
like a bright fuchsia oh my god it
smells amazing it's like super minty
which I love in lip products a little
bit hard to get a clean line with this
applicator kind of like frayed it has
more of like a moosie formula to it so I
love the shade of this application is a
little bit difficult I feel but I love
the smell of it and it feels kind of
like tingling or cooling on your lips so
I think that's everything I can't do a
full on wear test in this video to see
how the face combination everything
holds up because I'm actually going to
get my lash extensions put back on right
now which I am so excited for no more
lash glue so that's everything I hope
