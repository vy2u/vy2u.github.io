pondering when my eyelash glue is drying
all right so today we're doing a
full-face drugstore first impression
video I have a ton of new products
here I went into Walgreens to pick up
one thing and Deneb walking out with 15
things I also placed an order online
also with a bunch of new releases
because I was on there the other day and
there were literally eight pages of
brand new products this is the season it
is the season for new releases Thank You
drugstores so trying out some new
products from Jordana position is
formula Revlon L'Oreal new brand is
being carried out alta lots of good
stuff in this video that you guys are
excited make sure you give this a thumbs
up my hair is beyond needing to be
washed right now I'm on like day four of
dry shampoo keeping it classy so if you
want to see how I got this look and when
I think of a bunch of new products
you're in the right place just keep
watching
alright so I've already washed and
moisturize my face but I'm going to
prime using my ELF press and hydrate
balm I've used this a few times and I
like this it's like a stick obviously
primer and it feels super cooling on
your face until you blend it out and I
just like to use my fingers it does get
a little bit tacky when it kind of sets
into your skin which is good for
prepping for foundation and also smells
bomb it smells super fresh so I have two
plunges that I'm going to try for
foundation mi use one on one side one on
the other this is the next flawless slim
foot flawless finish blending sponge I
believe this is new is on the new
section on Ulta and then I also have
this which I know is new this is a
Revlon sponge professional blending
brush this is very interesting-looking
is those you supposed to replace the
sponge every three months it doesn't say
on the back of here if you're supposed
to wet this I never have good luck
applying dry sponges so I think I am
going to wet this thing it is super tiny
not wet so it might be good for actually
like under-eye concealer but we're going
to try it for foundation shape wise this
next one looks almost identical to the
pure cosmetic sponge it has this flat
edge right here feels pretty nice and
squishy for nothing what I have a giant
bowl of water here really great for all
the technology around so I'm going to
wet both of these whoo this next one is
getting very large can it's super
squishy this is
promising yeah this next one feels
really nice and squishy the Cantonese
shoe it doesn't look like there's any
glue in this contraption and pretty sure
it just detaches and kind of screws out
so I think it's okay to dampen on and I
will find out a little bit tricky to
squeeze out the water with swells on
this thing okay so I got way bigger so
for foundation this is a brand new line
in Ulta I believe it's online only right
now I haven't seen in stores this is the
Bronx colors waterproof foundation as
the shade light beige which is lighter
shades haven't heard anything about this
brand they had a ton of stuff on Ultra
from them and it was pretty affordable
has really nice glass packaging and it's
looking pretty light in here so from a
single seat and it does have a pump too
so looking on Ulta this is online only
it's at the retails for $12.99
you only get 0.67 fluid ounces of
product in here so not a full ounce and
it comes in six shades says it's a
waterproof formula that gives you a
medium to strong coverage recommended
for all skin types so I'm not doing a
full wear test today because when I'm
filming this right now it's like 7:00
p.m. I actually leave on a trip tomorrow
morning so I can't do a whole full date
wear test for this video I think I'm
going to start with this thing and just
go ahead and stick it right in
so this sponge is super wobbly since you
are holding it down here you don't have
a whole lot of control over the actual
sponge so means I think I just keep it
down with this sponge it's definitely
looking like light coverage I personally
like more full coverage foundations
medium to full just because they
obviously have a lot of acne and
scarring to cover up but we can go in
and cover anything with concealer that
the foundation doesn't cover shades mine
is looking pretty nice I almost would
rather just hold the sponge it's kind of
annoying tap just hold the stick and the
sponge down has that weird texture it
doesn't feel like the Real Techniques a
Beauty Blender it has a different
consistency too it's almost like more
rubbery
let's do the next sponge on the other
side and then I might try a brush for a
second layer size comparison this one
looks like a freaking dinosaur next to
this so I'm using the flat edge on the
sponge yeah
very light coverage
as a nice finish though it looks really
nice and luminous application was twice
as fast with this sponge let's see if
this foundation is buildable even
expunged when I said in my face to see
if it's buildable and then going up the
second layer with a brush on this side
and see if I can get better coverage I'm
going with some more feet 31 brush on
the other side super luminous finish on
this thing they actually like the way to
apply better with the sponge so I'm just
going to go ahead and smooth out and we
got pretty much the exact same coverage
still at light coverage I'm gonna get up
close to you guys and see it has a
really pretty kind of natural look to it
though so I tried to find the new
wet-and-wild concealer I did a full
foundation review on the new one wild
sort of focus foundation I have not been
able to find a concealer or the new
powder anywhere in Seattle so I'm just
using a different drugstore product if I
don't have a new release to use in this
video I'm just using virtual products so
this is one of my favorite concealers
into the collection cosmetics lasting
finish
I actually get this on eBay and I also
use that two spot conceal since we
didn't get a whole lot of coverage as
the foundation running out of this thing
feels weird film and night right now I'm
actually pretty shocked that the shade
of this is light enough I like the shade
of this foundation a lot and now that
I've spot concealed it's actually
looking really nice and smooth so the
under eyes going down to my normal
stargazer powder you can do this for
five bucks off of Amazon so this powder
is fairly new this is the covergirl
clean matte powder this came out when
they launched the covergirl clean my BB
cream I have a full review on that BB
cream it's on my favorite products
within my 2016 favorites video I feel
like the storm of putters was actually
kind of taking away some of the coverage
right now definitely mattified though
totally just forgot about all the cream
products I was going to use great so I
got this Jordana sculpting go cream
contour stick ding I really wanted to
use this thing I also have the L'Oreal
blend art it contour blender which I was
going to use but
cream products do not mesh well on top
of powder products especially on my skin
maybe I'll try and just patch test this
a little bit I really wanted to use if
it looks like a nice cool toned color my
cheeks actually don't feel super
powdered so this might work let's try
well this is a lot thicker than I was
expecting I thought I was going to be
like super thin thing this was pretty
name thick the color of the sponge makes
me super happy definitely went through a
neon phase in college when all I would
wear was me on it's not blending super
easily but that could very well be
because I'm trying to put it on top of
the pot right now and this is a shame 0
1 light camera member fetch I thought
they had three shades in the contour
product they also had highlight cream
highlighters which I rarely use so I
didn't pick that one up
okay this night actually blended that
way nicer so this I'm super excited
about this is Physicians Formula bronze
booster highlight and contour palette
there's three shades that come in here
as soon as I saw this middle shade on
Instagram I was on the hunt for this it
looks like it could potentially be a
really nice contour shade pretty
packaging gold opens up whoa there's a
brush under here this actually doesn't
feel too bad so I'm going to go in with
this middle shade let's see what you got
heck yeah so the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer that a lot of people love
for fair skin that one just pulls away
orange on me oh yeah I'm into this not
too warm not too a she doesn't look gray
if you're darker than I am you could use
this shade to set your under eyes these
I am super excited to try I got two of
the new Physicians Formula butter blush
this is a shade plum root Primrose plum
rose and then this is natural glow has a
really intense coconut sunscreen smell
this one that looks beautiful I am I
going with this one this one looks nice
and glowy taking my morphe Wi-Fi brush
whoo this is super pretty almost of like
a gold glow when it hits the light I
like this because it doesn't look too
peachy the scent makes me feel like I'm
at a Bahamas I think I'm actually going
to put a little bit of the shade on my
temples just blend it out super easily
and I feel like they have just the right
amount of pigment to them Physicians
Formula killin it so for a highlight
this palette is also brand-new from
Physicians Formula this is the highlight
contour palette illuminate version there
are three shades
mine is chilling down there there's a
gold highway in here a deeper kind of
and then this one looks like pure white
so I'm super excited for this white one
party I'm excited it literally feels
like butter oh heck yes this is intense
this one is definitely more intense than
those positions for a shimmer brick if
you want like a BAM highlight it doesn't
look glittery this is gorgeous looks
like almost a wet highlight and I barely
tapped my brush in OH
a little excited my lip highlight right
now is out to party so far really
feeling all those cheek contour
highlight products so for brows this is
brand-new by L'Oreal distance the brow
stylist frame and set cream prom cream
Paul made to 15g brunette this comes
with a little brush in here and this
looks like the Anastasia dip brow our
gel actually makes one of my favorite
brow pomade I think it's just as good as
the Anastasio one and it does from the
drugstores like under nine bucks brush
feels pretty cheap but we can use this
end I think the shade of this is perfect
really creamy but it doesn't feel like
it's sliding around too much even with a
mattifying covergirl powder this
foundation is still coming through
luminosity which I personally like I
love when that happens where you can
still set your face but you still see
the glow coming through so this is new
from Revlon they came out with new cream
eyeshadows I can't tell is this one with
shimmery it looks like all the shades
besides this one we're shimmery this is
m15 expresso cream eyeshadows can be
good to serve as a base for your powder
eyeshadows so we're going to kind of
prime with this there weren't too many
things from the new Revlon releases but
I was that into what the heck so this
mini ass brush just slid out of here
that is interesting
never seen that packaging before so
theoretically you could maybe apply this
with this let's try it sweet so this one
does look matte which is great I wish
they came out with a lighter matte shade
but you could use it to prime your eyes
this is a pretty color since I kind of
want to blend this upwards and use my
finger feels super lightweight feels a
little bit less sticky than the
Maybelline Dream
to dream tattoo South those are cold
color tattoos color tattoos you're just
running out the door I could totally
just put this on the lid and kind of
blend it out with the blender brush it
would be interesting that try this as a
contour shade can't really blend with
these nails little wood trim for getting
the product onto your eye this thing
actually works fine if you don't want to
like dig your nails in there alright
this is nice - it is a cool idea that it
just slides right into the cap and I
kind of just totally should talk to it
nothing like great job Revlon don't
judge a book by it's cover
you know Sam so don't have any new
eyeshadow releases that I can use
besides the elf match format - palette
which I did just use in the shadow areas
video I just want to do a super basic
eyelets we get the have some intense
falsies to pop on it's going to go in
with the second shade over and blend we
already have a nice base down with that
brown I'm still in shock from this
highlight if you wanted to you could
definitely just stop here and put on
mascara or eyeliner or whatever I'm
going to add a little bit more depth to
the crease so I'm just going to go in
with this darker brown shade right here
elfs also came out with a new foundation
I want to save aqua aqua something let
me know if you guys want to see that
maybe for a foundation Friday or
something I'm going to go back and blend
with that brush this is the morphe 511
by the way it put all of the brushes and
products I use every single video in the
description box everything is linked
before you comment check the downbar
planning on doing an all matte eye look
but I almost want to go back in the
Physicians Formula highlight and you set
gold or bronze shade on the lid gonna be
really pretty let's do it I don't want
to take this coppery shade the darker
one who needs eyeshadow this looks just
as beautiful with eyeshadow super
metallic I'm just going to go back in
with that first ratchet that we used and
blend some this on the lower lash line
to pull it all together it is so freakin
hard not to open your mouth when you do
this the skills you get by doing YouTube
I think we're actually going to skip out
on the liquid liner today I'm just going
to go in with the Maybelline colossal
Big Shot mascara I think I've used this
one time before I was not super
impressed if I remember correctly but
we're going in with falsies anyways
after this so I just want to try it
again the amount of money
Maybelline has been on this bigshot
campaign you think they just create
the most revolutionary mascara on planet
earth more of a drive formula it does
look nice and lengthening well that's
great super fast actually everyone's
mascara preferences are super different
so I found two new lash lines at
Walgreens I found the kiss faux mink
collection last cook slash couture
collection they had about four different
styles and I also saw dance which I'm
super excited about this is the aisle or
vlogger collection house pretty cool is
is that there's a blogger series this
would not have happened five years ago
so congrats Nicole I think there are
three or four other bloggers in this
collection but I got one for three bye
Nicole Guerrero this was the one that
was just speaking to me as an aisle or
makes one of my favorite lashes 121 two
bands on these are pretty sick oh man
I'm excited feel like I always have some
good life pondering when my eyelash glue
is drying that crap is flying all
experience and my foundation fell it
just went face down on the carpet when I
provided this department people are
going to be like what what's happening
in this room there's lash glue all over
there's false eyelashes stuff two places
my eyelashes just got real heavy these
would be really nice prom or special
event flashes you can do a thin coat of
the big shot mascara on the bottom
lashes I usually use my wet n Wild mega
length we got this out might as well use
it
so Walgreens had a display of these
brand new Jordana liquid lipsticks I
haven't heard anything about these yet
so looks like there were at least ten
shades to me in these if I had a really
nice shade range I only pick up two
shades because I wanted to see how the
formula is by the shade zero seven
tiramisu and then twenty three
buttercream frosting this one totally
speaks to me so I think we're going to
try out this first this one has given me
Stila
patina vibes corticon Mitchell Matt I am
excited these were $4.99 it felt really
good
it smells almost exactly like cold stone
cake butter ice cream very thin that I
can tell us about very spin formulas it
looks a lot peachy or on them it does in
the tube to me on my skin tone it's
looking very peachy she's going on nice
and smooth and not patchy
hasn't totally dried down yet I think
I'm gonna actually add tiramisu over top
boo this looks pretty this is like a
deeper berry hopefully you can't hear my
room
right now so the Sun so it takes about
20 to 30 seconds for these to fully dry
down but when they do they are totally
dry
is it transferring all of you guys on
snapchat how these where but this shade
is beautiful the nice deep rose shade
really pretty that is everything I am
pleasantly surprised by most of stuff I
tried I think my bottom least favorite
three products that I tried is probably
this Revlon sponge don't really think
you need a stick and I just don't like
this material a lot the Maybelline
colossal Big Shot this is nice
it just been totally wow me and then
this shade of the Jordana for my skin
tone just looks a little bit off a
little bit too Orangery but the formula
and the way it applied went on totally
fun we do feel pretty drying now that I
put it on for a couple minutes they feel
almost exactly like the colour-pop ultra
matte lips actually yeah that is exactly
what these are mine we have my top 3
this is hard because I actually like a
bunch of the stuff that I've tried this
contour shade beautiful this highlight
beautiful if you want a more intense
highlight really like the blush I
totally use this cream eyeshadow again
especially if you have green eyes this
just kind of makes them pop even though
this foundation is very light coverage I
like the shade of it I like how it's
sitting on my skin right now I think I
could use this and just spot conceal not
doing a full wear test in this video but
I will wear it again and update you guys
on snapchat if you want to see full
foundation reviews I do foundation
Friday every single Friday on my channel
I also do 15 days of foundation so both
