fill in the turtleneck to beige tried to
do some summery eyes to make up for it
and then this happened when I came back
from my trip I had a freaking mountain
of boxes with new products to try out so
I'm trying out a ton of them in this
video star of the show is the BH
Cosmetics Carli bybel palette have a few
new things from Urban Decay Smashbox
beige cosmetics a bunch of good so
if any point while you're watching this
you're enjoying and having a good time
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
bay reader family and subscribe if you
want to see how I got this look you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right we're already on to round 3 of
coffee
pretty sure I've had this mug since
freshman year in college so I have a ton
of new products here that I am very
excited to put on my face I already use
this one this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD skin booster I wanted to give
it a few minutes to set into my skin so
I already applied it but it basically is
just a dropped kind of serum that feels
exactly like most serums do except this
one dried in extremely fast it absorbed
in literally about 20 seconds into my
skin it doesn't really have the growth
serum kind of scent just smells kind of
fresh and light the Smashbox came out
with a photo finish radiance primer I'm
hoping this isn't tinted because it kind
of looks like it does it has hyaluronic
acid in it
here's what the bottle looks like so it
definitely looks a bit tinted but let's
just see how it goes I feel like that's
given me a globe it actually doesn't
look like it really darken my skin at
all my face is just red because i'm
rubbing it actually maybe it did doesn't
have the same feel as their other
primers like doesn't have a silicone
feel to it so I have two different
sponges here that I have to go wet but I
wanted to show you them in the packaging
first this is a new L'Oreal blend
artists and fallible sponge it has the
pointed kind of tip and then a bigger
base I picked up a few things for BH
Cosmetics and one of them was this mini
sponge
I haven't had good luck with these in
the past for blending out concealer but
I want to try it so I'm going to go wet
these to my favorite sponge lately is
what I brought with me love's gone is
this morphe sponge this is frickin bomb
you guys I don't like the kiss that much
I mean I have been using it to blend out
concealer but I love the base of this
there's something about the base it just
gives you such good coverage like this
thing is up there with my
techniques right now so the little baby
one definitely got bigger this one got
friggin huge is like a tennis ball now
but it feels super nice and squishy but
this thing is giant like look at this so
for foundation I'm still testing out
white mixers because I'm testing out
white mixers for the white mixer video
great point Taylor that will be coming
in the next week or two I brought all of
them with me when I was gone I've been
trying them out so I haven't tried out
this one yet this is the makeup designer
EHD err liquid makeup I got this at
IMATS
this might be intended to put in like
one of the airbrush systems but I
remember the lady saying that I can use
it not in that this is going to be a
major foundation cocktail today so I'm
mixing the white mixer with the Bourjois
healthy mix serum because this one's too
dark and super glowy and then I want to
mix in some of the Urban Decay Velvet
Iser this is brand-new from Urban Decay
this is super interesting it's a
translucent mixing medium that's
supposed to help modify and give your
skin like a soft matte velvety kind of
finish so I picked this foundation
because it's one super glowy so we'll
see how this works as a mixing medium
that that was such a cool concept just
when you think brands have done
everything Urban Decay comes in so I'm
going to get to mixing I have a whole
video on this foundation I think I did
it during the second 15 days of
foundation series so a few drops of that
white lightened it pretty quickly just
so I don't waste it what's on my hand
I'm just going to wipe it on my face
before we mix in the medium here we go
with this thing I do not know how much
you're supposed to mix into this whoa
whoa whoa said what literally ten times
this is a weird you guys it's like a
super imma show you close up it's like
literally build it on your fingers so
here's what that consistency looks like
in there I don't put about a dime-size
amount in there and it's going to whoa
you can feel the consistency changing
alright let's go to town whoa yeah this
feel is different just use the bottom
keep in mind that this bourgeois
foundation doesn't have a whole lot of
coverage to start with at all I'm
guessing enough to spot conceal but
typically without the velvet Iser it's a
very very glowy finish that definitely
mattified it a bit and it almost feels
like it's already setting down
the sponge feels nice really nice you
have a ton of surface area right there
so it just blends out really quickly
oh and crampy that time of the month
isn't it really crazy when you think
about the fact that we sync each other
so weird like how does that happen if
someone actually knows why or how that
happens comment down below I do feel
like you have to work pretty quickly
with this though since it is kind of
mattifying it definitely dries quicker
it almost makes your foundation set to a
powder finish like you have a powder on
top but my skin just looks very natural
right now so I have a new concealer
trial by BH Cosmetics this is a total
coverage concealer I believe this is a
new product from them or fairly new I
have the lightest shade 101 depending on
how like this is I'm going to also try
it underneath my eyes but I'm first
going to try it to spot conceal whoa
this is an interesting little top looks
like a lip gloss top the edge cosmetics
is super affordable and you can almost
always get discount codes from them I
just go and retailmenot.com for all my
coupon codes or ebay also hasn't listed
sometimes see how much this covers might
as well use oh we have our little
concealer sponge let's try this I was
actually going to put that directly on
the sponge yeah I'm going to try this
underneath the eyes I'm going to use my
concealer brush where are you sure
morphe the G 38 I was like to use just
to kind of bring it above my eyes that's
nice I like the way that that blended
out it feels what does this feel like
it's like another concealer Oh feels
almost like the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD very lightweight creamy but gives you
that coverage even out the rest of my
face a little bit I don't know what it
is about this brush but it just gives
you the best coverage with concealer
it's what I use a spot conceal usually
it's what I use underneath my eyes to
blend out the concealer it's the only
brush for me that doesn't take away the
coverage so I don't think I've tried
this as an all-over face powder yet this
is the Burberry over 12news powder it
says that it's a sheer luminous pressed
powder for under my eyes I'm actually
going to mix in
by that what with the star kids or white
press powder just because my under eyes
are already light right now so I don't
want it to be a super super light so I'm
just going to mix those two bit and see
what happens
there we go that works actually don't
know if I want to set my whole face I'm
kind of feeling the semi glow we have
going on my cheeks look very matte my
Center my forehead looks a little bit
glowy I'm curious to see if that urban
decay stuff helps keep you Matt
throughout the day I'm not going to be
doing a check-in today because I'm
actually going to be taking off all my
makeup set to go to something after this
but I'll keep using that and let you
guys know probably on snapchat mmm I
don't know man kind of on try out this
powder all over okay feel like that
doesn't do anything does it
hmm I'm just going to keep my forehead
without as I think so like the way my
forehead looks right now before I try
out new stuff for the rest of my face
I'm just going to do my brows really
quick all the products I use will be
down below but I'm just using my normal
benefit and a brow gel okay my camera
just totally shut off I thought it
literally broke but now it's working so
fingers crossed we can make it through
this video can I just use Mac Paint Pot
soft ochre to prime my eyelids I'm super
excited to try out this this is the
urban decay naked skin shapeshifter this
is one their new contour palettes
Mallory brought this thing when we were
in Portland and she said she loves it
and I tried to highlight from it and the
highlight was really nice but it is very
heavy like this thing is an arm workout
I could do Jillian Michaels with this
and it's very top-heavy like this mirror
weighs more than the actual product of
but this shade right here looks like it
has potential so I'm going to try to
size the contour or show you this using
my wedding I'll brush all the brushes I
use are always listed down below in the
description box so this has a lot of
kick up hmm well it's segmented holy
 See's whoa okay we are not going
for the natural contour today tone of
that though looks really nice I'm just
going to have to like majorly blend that
up and go back over with my sponge
one that a little bit definitely super
pigmented you need to just lightly tap
your brush in there so that was barely
barely tapping my brush room I don't
typically like contours and blushes to
be super pigmented because
because it harder to work with besides
of being super pigmented I'm really
feeling the tone of this for blush I'm
gonna try lefty number seven peach
velvet blush never used this before hmm
that's pigmented one two again I just
catch my brush in there very pigmented I
like the shade of that though I always
get questions about this brush this one
is by for less it's the cb4 brush more
if he makes a similar one Sigma actually
doesn't I don't know why they don't have
a big dense brush like this for a
highlight I think I'm going to use the
highlight in this palette as well just
so you guys can see it it looks like
nothing super thrilling in the pan at
all and it almost looks like it would be
too dark for me but once it's on it's
really pretty I do feel like it
emphasizes my texture but definitely one
of those highlighters that you can kind
of see on your skin oh
definitely wanted to use oh dang it I'm
using the Carli bybel palette on my eyes
and I definitely wanted to use that
white highlight alright we're just going
to have a really intense highlight today
and layer the two let's go in with Carly
over here this is Carly's collaboration
with BH Cosmetics it has 21 I shadow Zin
here oh no 21 of everything it has 15 I
shadowed maybe 6 highlighters a bunch of
different shades of the highlighters it
says there's 11 original shades in here
plus 10 new shades and highlighters I
haven't tried her original palette so
I'm excited to try this thing out but
I'm loving the marble packaging holy
 I love that there's a highlight
shade for pretty much any skin tone in
here I definitely want to route this
white one right here there's also really
pretty looking pink shade almost just
put my highlight brush in coffee oh yeah
I actually usually love using the BH
eyeshadows of highlights so no shots
that I like this intense but I did just
layer two highlights but look at that
heck yeah it cut early nose and keep it
slow that is super pretty so I'm sorry I
feel like I'm liking almost everything
which is rare so I think we're going to
move on to eyes using Carly's palette if
you haven't tried the formula of BH
Cosmetics eyeshadows they're great
they're super affordable they're
typically really pigmented soft I did a
super warm look in Monday's video so I
think I might
in for like the purple so there's some
super pretty purples kind of peach
shades in here Gold's warm tones this
pink shade is kind of speaking to me oh
that looks pretty there's like some
duochrome kind of gold in there too I
start with this matte kind of transition
shade right there in the corner
I like there's also a big mirror on here
if you have green eyes that shade makes
them pop I'm going to take this purple
shade right here and blend that kind of
into the crease I think I feel like
these have a perfect amount of pigmented
but where they still super easily blend
out I'm going to take that pink shade
right here with my finger and put that
on the lid this looks so pretty oh heck
yeah
it looks like I wet my brush and just
put that on
that's how metallic and smooth this is
Carly you're killin it so freakin pretty
hope it's showing up on camera how it
looks in real life an inner corner
highlight I think I'm actually going to
take that pink highlight shade right at
the bottom and put that right on the
inner corner almost have some purple or
like on this little bit of blue actually
in there blend in a little bit of that
white kind of like how this looks just
with the lashes and just keeping it
really open so I don't think I'm going
to put any waterline eyeliner on or a
liquid liner but I am going to blend
some eyeshadow down to the bottom I
think I'm going to use that first
transition shade because that just made
my eyes pop I'm going to bring some of
the purple shade down there as well for
bottom mascara I'm gonna use my normal
wet and wild mega length all the shades
that I've tried in this palette I am in
love which I think it's beautiful
can't wait to play around with the
eyeshadows more because they just blend
out so easily and I feel like they're
just the perfect perfect formula good
job Kylie so for lips this isn't
technically a new product but it's new
to me this is the hooter beauty I feel
like you just have to say that fast it
could be liquid matte lipstick this is
like a vampy purple I think this might
look cool with the eyes this is the
shade silver fox I only tried super
briefly trophy wife the other day I just
put it on took an Instagram photo into
the dog
had to take my makeup off oh this is
like a grey what the heck
definitely thought this was like a deep
purple from the outside of the box isn't
totally what I'm going for so let me try
and find a different color
I have vixen but this looks like more of
a deep red I might use this and just put
some of that purple eyeshadow over top
actually so it takes a little bit to dry
down but the formula feels thin but not
super drying which I like so it looks
like it's starting to dry down to
mattify now but it's probably drying for
about a minute now this shade is frickin
stunning this is vixen did I say that I
almost don't even know if I want to add
anything to the top of this because I
kind of like the super deep matte right
now with all the other glowy going on I
don't know do we add a little purple or
now I'm going to do it I can always go
back over it with the liquid lipstick if
I don't want it I'm just going to take
the matte purple shade right here a tiny
bit and dab it in the center alright so
I feel like that was super subtle just
added a tiny bit of dimension I think
the last thing yeah is the new morphe
prep and set spray so you can
technically spray this before your
makeup too you can spray a new setting
spray before your makeup pretty much
have used this one time and it's super
interesting it's an aerosol can so you
don't have to worry about getting like
the dots or splotches of setting spray
since it's just a super fine mist so I'm
just going to attempt to get my hair I
love this spray feel super refreshing
and it has a really light fresh scent as
I've only won this once I can't say how
it actually holds your makeup throughout
the day but I love the way that it goes
on and I feel like that just add some
glow I think it added a little bit of
glow well totally got my hair alright so
this is the final look I think this is a
very rare occasion and I'm liking 99% of
things I try it I think the sponge is
definitely at the bottom decided to use
the contour from this again super into
the Carli bybel palette I want to play
around to concealer more but right now
I'm loving the way my under eyes
has really nice coverage and my eyes
don't look dry or crepey under there at
all right now obviously can't speak to
the formulas and how it wears throughout
the day or anything yet but right now
it's feeling nice feels a little tiny
bit tacky but it just might take a
little bit longer to fully dry down but
the shade of this is beautiful
I also want to keep trying out this
thing to see if it helps me stay matte
throughout the day actually don't have
anything that I totally hate for once if
you guys enjoyed this video make sure
