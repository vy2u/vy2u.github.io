neighbors starts performing at the a no
concert I hope you guys can't hear that
but she's not doing too bad today he's
actually okay we're gonna that's how
she's playing a role in breeze all right
sorry all right so today we have my top
10 most repurchased drugstore items I
literally feel like I'm trying to record
alright so I just looked back at the
footage that you are about to watch and
I don't know why my external mic is on
we could still hear the focusing a
little bit if you're a camera a techy
person please let me know how to fix
this it just like won't focus on my face
so sorry that it's going in and out
right now I don't have it on autofocus I
just focused it let me know how to work
this frickin camera with this lens on
autofocus please alright I think she's
moved on to the guitar I was watching on
these videos a couple weeks ago and I
thought Taylor you should do that I feel
like I haven't done that most of the
like basic YouTube videos so I should
start doing those so I am filming this
video on my Canon t5i which is brand new
if you follow me on Instagram and it has
autofocus so I got a different mic so
hopefully you guys can't hear it
wow that's gonna be an interesting video
I started off with definitely one of my
Holy Grail products this is Physicians
Formula translucent mineral where help
free correcting powder so this is
actually supposed to be a correcting
powder which means I supposed to cancel
out any pigments and your skin and any
redness I actually use this for setting
my under eye powder which you know if
you've seen any of my get ready with me
shadow and schmooze videos this is
literally a lifesaver for me because
it's super frustrating when you find a
concealer that's light enough and then
the powder darkens it up if you need a
good super firm powder even for all over
your face try this thing out next one is
L'Oreal ever pure sulfate free shampoo
and
conditioner I love the rosemary mint
scent there's the other what is the
other one like something minty the
shampoo and conditioner are amazing this
I farm my favorite drugstore shampoo and
conditioner actually preferred drugstore
shampoos and conditioners to high-end
high-end never does the same thing for
my hair just makes your hair feel super
soft they're still thick free so if you
color your hair it's not going to strip
the color at all they always have
coupons for these in the weekly odd so I
like to wait till they go on sale my
next most repurchase item is the
Physicians Formula
eye booster two and one lash boosting
eyeliner and serum if you've seen any of
my get ready with me videos again you've
seen me use this this is literally I use
every single day for my eyeliner for the
past two years probably this thing is
amazing it's super black you have to get
this shaded ultra black not just black I
love it because it has a super fine
point so you can easily make that wing
if you're looking for a waterproof like
super long lasting eyeliner this isn't
it this is just good for everyday wear
but I just love the way that this
applies and looks and it's super easy if
you're a winged beginner piano concert
and stuff the next product
I've probably bought about ten of these
this is the suave rocket infusion dry
shampoo I have tried the batiste dry
shampoo higher-end dry shampoo the
L'Oreal dry shampoo I think I've tried a
good amount of dry shampoos and nothing
compares to this this is super
affordable it does such an amazing dry I
clearly have dark hair so sometimes that
could be an issue with dry shampoo with
the white showing up this one isn't the
best for not having a white light
residue but you literally just rub it
into your hair and it goes away fine if
it works for me on black hair it can
work for you my most repurchase
drugstore foundation is definitely
Revlon Colorstay
I just have a pump on it right now from
Beauty MP so you don't have to pour it
out this pump which is great this is
hands down one of the best drugstore
foundations when it is extra great about
it is that is actually light enough
my skin I use this either by itself or
it's a really great foundation to mix in
with other foundations
I picked the combo oily skin formula
they also have a dry skin formula I
believe actually happened on my face
right now I mixed in with the NARS all
day luminous foundation which I'm
testing out dirt you know if you're
looking to branch out into the drugstore
foundation world and you don't know
where to start
give this guy a go my mostly purchased
drugstore primer is the L'Oreal magic
blinking primer this gives you a super
pretty glow it's long lasting since I
found my graphic since I found the
Maybelline master prime blur no loony I
haven't been using this guy as much just
because I feel like this Maybelline one
does such an amazing job of showing
through your foundation it gets your
super pretty glow one thing I hate about
this is the smell it smells it's super
chemically and nasty but everything else
about is good my next item is actually
pretty new to the drugstore is the
L'Oreal infallible Pro setting spray
makeup extender setting spray whatever
this is just a makeup setting spray and
even though it's I think this is like
four or five months old now I have
literally repurchased this four times
already I don't know why I go through so
fast I do a lot more sprays I feel like
then the skin to Navy aside things spray
I already have a backup ready to go and
I run out of this one this works amazing
I feel like it actually gives like a
natural glow to your face it definitely
isn't like a matte setting spray I love
this stuff I don't think all the
repurchasing Scandanavia because this is
about half of the price this is way
better video and it does the same thing
if not better alright then I have two
mascaras one is what I use on the top of
my top lashes and that's enabling
falsies volume Express my tube is pretty
nasty not quite sure what's on there
this is one of my all-time favorite
mascaras because it has a super nice
curved brush I love mascaras that like
lash on your lashes and give them
or a nice pearl and this just separating
and it's black and it's great I haven't
repurchased this since I found the
Maybelline I always forget the name of
this soon as I found the Maybelline lash
sensational I've been just using this
and repurchasing this I've been using
this for about a year and a half this is
me wet and wild make a Lynx mascara for
the bottom lashes I only use this on my
bottom lashes you can't go wrong with
this thing this is literally the best
bottom mascara because it doesn't
transfer on to your under eyes or
concealer the brush is just super tiny
and perfect for getting in your bottom
lashes or we're done the last thing like
that would be really best time flies
when you're having fun all right the
last item is my Neutrogena makeup
removing wipes I just have them in a
case but this is what they look like
as far as a makeup wipes go these are
definitely my favorite makeup wipes
Haley have an itch on your forehead
layering Foundation tough through it
tough through it I've used these for
years probably like five years over the
last few months I've kind of switched
out the way I take off my makeup I love
the Garnier cleansing lotion that is now
my like go-to makeup remover but I still
use this when I am too lazy to like do
the whole process and I just want one
super easy swipe you know I'm saying I
almost feel like I should keep a pack of
these like in the couch so when I'm
watching Grey's Anatomy and I'm falling
asleep I can just like wipe it across my
face that's my shirt just take off all
of my waterproof eye makeup they take
off everything they're great I think
they're worth the money I've tried the
other like knockoff versions and they're
not as good in my opinion so those were
my top 10 most repurchase drugstore
items if you liked this video give it a
thumbs up so I know apologies for the
little concert at the beginning of this
video if you could hear it kind of hope
you could because you're Britney about
ten love you guys thanks for watching
and see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
