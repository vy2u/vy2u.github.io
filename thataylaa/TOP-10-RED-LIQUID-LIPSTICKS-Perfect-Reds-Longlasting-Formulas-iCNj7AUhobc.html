all right so the holidays are obviously
coming up hence all of this so I thought
it would be a good time to talk about my
top ten favorite liquid lipsticks that
are read definitely good phrase that
better so I have a ridiculous amount of
red liquid lipsticks literally at least
100% hope so I've tried my fair share of
red liquid lipsticks and over the years
these are the ones that stand out that I
always go back to some of these I've
used for years and some are more recent
fine so these are my top ten perfect red
liquid lipsticks I usually and when I
say usually I mean like 99.9 percent of
the time will wear liquid lipsticks
especially when it comes to red just
because then you don't have to deal with
it transferring you don't have to deal
with it sliding around on your face if
I'm wearing any kind of bright color or
dark shade of lipstick I almost always
do a liquid lipstick there are so many
great liquid lipstick formulas out now
that there are ones that aren't super
drying and aren't super uncomfortable to
wear so if you're excited for this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you're new here you can join the baby
doe family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m.
Pacific time so the first two shades I'm
going to be talking about are by
Smashbox I don't know what this is
classy beauty guru we can ignore that
I'm pretty sure it's lash glue this is
they're always on liquid lipstick
formula which has become one of my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas this
year it is so great they're comfortable
they stay on amazing throughout the day
by the way I tried to choose kind of an
array of different red shades some that
are brighter some that are more cool
toned some that are more orange E some
that are deeper just so you can choose
what you think you might like
so this first shade is bang bang this
one is like a bright red but there's
something about this that is just so
flattering I have a few different videos
using this the makeup for photography
video if you searched the tailor in the
name of any product if I have a video
using it it'll come up but this shade is
one of my go-to Reds the next shade by
Smashbox is Baz I'm going to show you
guys watches of all these these two are
pretty similar bang bang I would go with
if you like more of a classic bright red
and Baz has a little bit more fuchsia
tones to it there's definitely a little
bit more berry in there
I love the applicator in these you have
this flat paddle but it has a little bit
of a point at the end which just makes
it really easy to get a sharp line I
never use lip liner
I'm using a liquid lipstick because I
usually can just use the applicator to
get a smooth line I always appreciate
when there's an applicator like that
that just makes it super easy I actually
have bang bang on right now on top of
the next one I'm going to talk about but
bang bang is the color on the center
that's like the true red honourable
mentioned this is not included in the
ten but also misconduct is a really
pretty shade this one is definitely more
of like a deep berry color but if you're
into berry for the holidays you might
really like this one too this isn't as
much of a red I would call it definitely
more of like a purple berry like try not
to bend my arm right now because I have
wet swatches on the next liquid lipstick
I'm mentioning is from ardell and this
formula has become up there for me if
this is the matte whipped lipstick in
the shade in high this is great I think
it's around 7 or 8 bucks you can get
this out Sally Beauty if you don't have
a store buy you you can get it online
too these are long lasting super
comfortable on the lips
I wouldn't call these whipped at all
they don't remind me of a mousse it
don't remind me of a whipped formula
this one is interesting it definitely
has more berry tones to it but it still
looks like a red it's like a cross
between a deep red and a berry and I
definitely wanted to include it because
especially if you layer it with
something like this or even if you have
a normal red lipstick doesn't have to be
a liquid lipstick doesn't have to be the
smashbox one if you just top it off with
a bright red lipstick and get that depth
where it looks a little bit deeper but
then you can kind of bring it back to
the red zone with a red lipstick so I
just really like layering this one I
like wearing it by itself
the only thing I would say I don't
really like about this one is the
applicator just for the reasons that I
mentioned it's not a bad applicator by
any means but it just is a little bit
tricky to get this smooth edge it's a
little bit frayed too I don't know if
you guys can see the kind of little
things sticking out this one takes a
little bit longer to dry down so if you
put it on and you feel like it's a
little bit sticky just give it a few
minutes and it'll dry down and I find it
to be really comfortable in lasts so
this next one is by Stila and if you've
been watching me for a long time you
know that for forever like since these
came out the Stila stay all day liquid
lipstick formula has been one of my
favorites doesn't move around they're
just great I have the mini size of this
because I rarely go through a whole ride
liquid lipsticks so you can get the mini
sized for cheaper on Sephora but this
isn't the shade fiery and this one is
similar to the Smashbox pause the second
one over there you probably don't need
both of them
but it's another read that has more of a
blue cool town look which just really
makes your teeth look super white love
to smell these smells like cake batter
alright so this next one I was debating
mentioning because when I'm filming this
today this says it's out of stock on
colourpop's website but I think this is
a permanent one it doesn't look like
this one there limit dish ones I hope
that this is the colour-pop ultra satin
lip in the shade lost I wanted to still
talk about this because this is one of
the most perfect red shades in my
opinion for the holidays it is so
freakin pretty it has just the right
amount of deepness to it where it
doesn't look too vampy but it still
gives you that like really wintery kind
of deep red look you know I'm talking
about this one also has a little bit of
that blue in there so it'll make your
teeth look white ultra satin lip formula
I much prefer over the ultra matte lip
the matte lip just gives you that super
dry cracky not comfortable lip kind of
situation the satin lip if you haven't
tried it is nice because it doesn't
super super transfer it's definitely not
the most long-lasting out of all the
formulas I'm gonna be talking about but
I don't find it to slide all over my
face colour-pop liquid lipsticks are
what 6 bucks 5 bucks 6 bucks so I really
hope they keep the shade because it is
stunning
alright these next two it's weird to
talk about this without mentioning 1548
because both these are by beo and for
those of you who don't know last year I
collaborated with B hue to make my own
liquid lipstick it was called 1548 and
it was like my perfect red shade and it
would be perfect for the holidays so I
wish I could mention it but it was lemon
Edition so it's not available anymore
but like I said then and like I still
say the B hue liquid lipstick formula is
extremely underrated it's great so I
have two red shades I wanted to show you
just depending on what what you're into
so the first one is called true red and
that is literally I mean I don't know
what else I can say about this it is
like a exact true classic red shade not
too warm not too cool not too deep it's
just a straight up red shade so if
you've only tried 1548 these ones do
smell different I wanted to do like
vanilla kind of scent smells kind of
like pumpkin spice or something to me I
like the smell of it it's not too
overpowering but the next one by them is
poppy red and this is like if you want
that fiery fiery red orange shade it's
actually really similar to bare minerals
fiery liquid lipstick if you're really
into super orangie reds this one is for
you I also feel like this would look
bomb in the summer or spring this
formula is super moisturizing takes a
little bit longer to set down but once
it does it is on there like it is not
budging great formula still to this day
one of my favorites so another one
that's similar to Smashbox bang bang but
a little bit more I'm looking at
swatches on my arm right now a little
bit more bright I would say and a little
tiny tiny bit more like pink in there is
this for cream lip stain this is in the
shade 0-1 I would say out of all of
these this one is on the slightly drier
side I don't put it on my lips and think
it feels like ultra dry or anything just
compared to the other ones this one is
slightly drier but they smell bomb
smells really similar to the Stila if
you want a bright red shade this one is
definitely more of like a I don't want
to say clown red because that doesn't
sound very appealing but it kind of is
it's like that bright bright red excuse
my messy swatches right now I'm trying
they're kind of going all over this is
another one that you'll recognize if
you've been watching my videos for a
while but I use this in a classic makeup
look video this one is definitely in my
like top three or four I would say red
shades this is the la splash smitten lip
tint mousse waterproof the form of this
stays on amazing you can get this on
Amazon for around 14 bucks I want to say
it has that richness to it which makes
it in my mind like a really good holiday
red that deep wintry thing whenever I do
these videos of like top of one shade
literally how many different ways can
you just guy read alright so last up is
an Oprah liquid lipstick this is in the
shade Milan and this one is definitely
more of a berry this one is actually
pretty similar to the Ardo over one as
you can see in the swatches is just
slightly slightly lighter if you still
want that berry tone but you don't want
it to be quite as deep as the Ardell one
you might like that oh for one out of
all these I'm mentioning Oprah tends to
wear off the quickest on the center of
my lips I still think they're definitely
long lasting liquid lipsticks they're
just not the most long-lasting they're
very comfortable they feel a little bit
more moosie smell really good though
again smell like cake or vanilla or
something so those are my top 10 red
liquid lipsticks for the holidays or
just for year-round but I feel like
some of these are perfect for the
holidays I hope you guys enjoyed this
