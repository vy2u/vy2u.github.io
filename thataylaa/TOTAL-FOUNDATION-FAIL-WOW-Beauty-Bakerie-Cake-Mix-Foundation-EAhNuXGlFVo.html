this is where I try out a new foundation
every single Friday on my channel 6 p.m.
Pacific time
this is the first thing I'm saying this
morning and right now what time is it
it's 752 a.m. I normally fill my intros
after I have the foundation on but I
thought we'd switch it up today start
out bare face so you guys are seeing me
literally first thing in the morning
right now so for today's foundation
we're gonna be trying out the Beauty
Bakery cake mix foundation how freakin
cute is this packaging I feel like I'm
about to make something in the Easy Bake
Oven you open this and then you have the
foundation in here I just think this is
one of the cutest foundation concepts
and packaging I've ever seen Beauty
bakery in general I love the whole idea
behind their brand I don't think I've
tried to any other Beauty bakery product
so this is my first one right here that
says our cake mix foundation is a medium
to full coverage Demi matte foundation
infused vitamin E get a smudge free
baked beet wake and bake face so Sunday
June retails for $28 and it comes in 30
shades the thing that's cool about this
is that they actually reversed the shade
range so number one is the deepest shade
and then number 59 which I have is the
lightest shade the other really cool
thing when I got this in the mail I did
not remember ordering two shades and
they give you a little card in here that
says for your first Sunday in order they
actually give you a free second shade
because they know how difficult it is
finding foundation shades you can send
both back to get a refund if neither
shade works for you or you can keep them
both gift one to someone I just thought
that was so cool I've never seen a brand
do that either and to give a full-size
like that's pretty cool they could have
easily just given sample sizes or
something it also says is vegan long
lasting and non acne genic formula so
I'm gonna serve swatches right here so
you can see how the shades 59 and 57 59
is the lightest one since it is reversed
compared to some of my other foundation
shades and I'm gonna be doing those
swatches after I film this so when I'm
actually applying it I haven't seen the
shades yet all right so here's some
swatches so the first two are the Beauty
bakery foundation so here's fifty nine
and fifty seven because again they go in
the opposite order so 59 is actually
supposed to be the lightest shade but if
you look at it compared to here it
actually looks definitely a bit darker
and more
salmon this one is a bit more like
yellow undertone derma called 2:08 which
is my closest shade match Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation in
porcelain and NARS natural radiant
foundation in Mont Blanc so if you're
excited for foundation Friday you can
give this video a thumbs up I appreciate
it if you're new here you can join the
bay reto family and subscribe I upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m.
subdued so alright so I've already
washed and moisturize my skin I have not
prepped it with this like I normally do
because I'm actually gonna be going in
with the Smashbox primer oil because
this specifically says to prep your cake
by massaging 1 to 3 drops of says their
wake and bake oil but I mean any any
facial oil probably works so I'm gonna
do what they say that's a little
concerning to me because that makes me
think this is gonna be like super heavy
matte my skin is definitely still more
on the dry side after being off accutane
for a while now
over a month 2 months how long have I
been out baggage and on you know so
let's just rub this in and this is so
funny to me using a primer oil because
when I had oily skin that literally
sounded like the worst idea I'm playing
at earth and now that I have dry skin
I'm like give me all the oils all the
moisture this primer oil though does
absorb into your skin really nicely I've
never had issues with it mixing weirdly
with foundation or anything and is made
for using before your makeup we give
that a minute to set in here but it says
to tap the foundation in stippling not
rubbing let's go into a shade 59 like I
said I haven't done swatches yet this
definitely looks like I'm gonna be the
shade 59 here it is last bottle copper
kind of top here I'm gonna give it a
shake so I'm half of my face I'm gonna
use my sponge like usual on the other
half my flat top kabuki this is actually
a brand new one right here because it's
super exciting if you guys saw
Wednesday's video I just pulled it
straight from the kit but what the heck
I still my mind is blown when I see this
box you check out Wednesday's video if
you missed the announcement but so
freaking cool to be able to do that with
Sigma for a brush that I use literally
every single day of my life this is just
a new one because all my other ones are
totally dirty right now in my time I'm
pre filming this right now so that
announcement video hasn't gone up yet so
I haven't seen your guys's like response
or anything yet but I just wanted to say
a pre thank you but I'm gonna have a
shadow and she was coming after all of
my 5000 trips right now
where we talk about the launch and just
everything because I feel like I have a
lot to talk with you guys about so this
does have a pump on it it just says
apply a few drops of the cake mix
foundation to the center of your face
and blend outwards gently tap in to
avoid streaks I'm gonna start out with a
pretty small amount I'm gonna start out
with the brush since they do say to
stipple I still want to try it with a
sponge I just tapped off a lot of this I
just have like a really small amount
normally this is less than what I would
use whoa okay we're gonna stipple
I can't help it has a really fresh scent
or this brush disk I think it's the
foundation whoa this is oxidizing holy
 cease that was weird that just like
in its use Wow
I am orange I hope that showed up on
camera that was weird
that was like within a few seconds it
like instantly turned orange whoa whoa
whoa you definitely have to work quick
with this one I did a tiny bit cuz it
looks like patchy right here I need a
mirror for this one this is really
interesting when I first put it on I
thought it was gonna be like super full
coverage and then within a few seconds
it darkened about literally three shades
I don't even think it's showing up on
camera it's not in real life it looks
Orange right now and it almost like
turned into light coverage I can see
everything coming through I gotta get
real up closer this way please don't
fall camera definitely looking like
light coverage it basically just kind of
canceled out some of the redness okay
let's try this again I wouldn't say it's
looking overly dry so that's good it
doesn't look like super heavy cakey or
anything
it's definitely clinging in certain
areas where I usually don't get clinging
like right here like I don't have any
major dry patches right now oh it looks
hella patchy let's try the sponge
because the brush clearly it's not
looking the best I'm confused
even though I have the primer oil on
right now I have not had issues using
the primer oil with a damp sponge
typically you know oil water kind of
thing but since there isn't like water
dripping out of here a damp sponge
usually works fine to blend out
foundation top of the primer oil
especially because it is like sunk into
my skin right now okay it looks very
patchy in certain areas I hope that's
picking up but my upper lip area right
here my pores look massive looks very
weird and dry and
most patchy on my nose and then just the
color it's like orange in certain parts
and then just hella patchy sponge versus
brush I think this side actually looks a
little bit better it looks like about
the same coverage definitely light
coverage there's no way I would call
this medium to full coverage off of one
layer I have a feeling if I tried to
build this up it would turn into a
disaster just because of how patchy and
almost weirdly cakey it is in certain
areas but the sponge side does look a
little bit more smooth and like less
textured in certain areas so I think I'm
going to do the sponge on my forehead
whew folks this is an interesting one
okay looking pretty dry while we're
really close with Mike right now right
on the center but it doesn't look like
horrible horrible but it does look a bit
cakey especially considering the amount
I've been using on my face I've been
using literally about a third of the
amount of foundation I usually is just
because it said to do a few drops for
that amount it's just looking so cakey I
really don't think it's picking it up
right now I give this about a 2 out of
10 I don't even know where those two
points are coming from though okay now
it's significantly whoa what is
happening hey I'm really hoping this is
picking up right now I need to like
whisper into the mic so I'm like on top
of it it is looking bad now up here it's
almost getting like drier and cakey are
looking this is one of those foundations
where I'm kind of debating you've been
doing the full day wear test right now
because off the bat I can tell you out
not put this on my face again and I
would not recommend this to you guys
between the major oxidizing patchiness
dryness weird things going on in certain
parts of my face how it's almost gotten
like cakier and drier looking just in
this what like ten minutes yeah ten
minutes I just don't feel like there's
totally a point maybe I'll try and build
it up at this point because if I'm not
gonna keep it on throughout the day then
at least we can see if it kind of builds
and gets to medium to full coverage I
think that's what I'm gonna do dang kind
of bummed I really wanted this one to
work because just like how cute this is
and everything I'm gonna first try and
build it up down here where it's super
patchy and didn't
I cover anything again it does say it's
supposed to be medium to full coverage
so let's try and look see how much
lighter it looks when it first goes on
so I'm just gonna turn this into okay
I'm gonna try and turn this into just
I'm doing everything I can to salvage
this one and if that works then we'll do
the wear test and if not then this one
is it no it doesn't want to see him to
blend together in certain areas it looks
super patchy right there wow this is
unique I just need to like hold my
camera right now so you guys can really
see this okay I think that is picking up
I can't point because I'm holding this
thing it just got super weird right
there maybe it's a sponge I'm gonna try
building it up with the brush on the
other side but you can see it kind of
clumping in that one area where it just
did not blend out again I'm using a tiny
amount that's the weird thing is that it
looks like a little bit it's gonna go
really long way and be like full
coverage when you first put it on and
then I almost shears as it dries I've
never had that happen before I don't
think with foundation super weird when
you put it on like that looked like it
was gonna work and be okay and then once
it dries down something weird happens
wow wow wow wow ooh look at that upper
lip oh yeah by the way when you see
close-up shots like this the edges are
just blurry because that's what a lens
does it's not a filter or anything
obviously as I'm trying to get you to
see every ounce of my face right now is
it still oxidizing I think it is so
setting spray we're really just drying
everything at this point maybe it'll
help it look a little bit less cakey so
let's just see I can't say I've never
seen mac fix+ make a foundation look
horse after springing it on so that's
promising
ah okay I just looked in the mirror for
the first time so sometimes this can
happen with mac fix+ where it looks
almost like milky for a minute and then
it dries down and it looks totally
normal but I've never had oh wow
I've never ever had this happen what's
getting worse I'm in a little bit of
shock right now obviously there's
something in the ingredients of these
that are not agreeing but I've literally
never in my life seen this happen with
any foundation of mac fix+ this is a
this is an actual joke right here
you know there's a first for everything
so now that I have about ten different
shades of orange on my face
some nice blotchiness I think it's safe
to say this one is a hard pass for me I
know this is an indie brand so I don't
want to totally on a small business
but I do still want to tell you guys
obviously what I think of products
regardless so unfortunately this is a
major major pass for me it did not work
out whatsoever even obviously before the
mac fix+ situation i mean you guys saw
it all i've heard some good things about
their other product so I do want to try
other things from their brand but
unfortunately this is just a major major
fail of a foundation I don't think I've
had this bad of one since 15a is a
foundation two seasons ago this is
pretty pretty rough as time is passing
now it does seem to be like melting in a
little bit more it's not super white and
like drippy anymore foundation fail
right here I hope you guys enjoyed this
video regardless all right so it's
actually the next morning now and I
wanted to try this again doing my usual
things so I primed my face using the Too
Faced three and one use this every
single day and I didn't use that oil
primer even though on the back of the
box and everything they say to use an
oil and it went a lot better but it
still looks pretty crappy and patchy I'm
going to zoom way in but this definitely
still oxidizes about the reshape so keep
them in mind it darkens a lot it's all
so very patchy super dry this is a very
odd formula when it first goes on it
seems really promising and then as it
dries it loses coverage it gets super
patchy my face is moisturized right now
it's exfoliated it should be fine for a
foundation application and it just looks
really bad
so oh good look at my forehead it just
looks so patchy dry weird stuff going on
so I just wanted to give this one
another shot to see how it did with my
normal what I normally do in case the
oil did affect it and I do think the oil
affected it but it looks just as bad now
yeah I'm glad I still tried it today
though to see just in case but this one
is still still a pass over here I also
wanted to add just predicting comments
here that if you have to use it what
their specific oil then I really think
especially since they gave you a free
second shade they should just include a
tiny sample of the oil to use it with
that's just my opinion and I don't think
in any case that you should need to buy
a second product to work with a
foundation especially to this degree
hopefully for next week's foundation
Friday we'll have a winner but I'm gonna
leave my foundation Friday playlist
linked down below in the description box
if you want to go and watch any others I
don't really know how to wrap this one
up but I love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
