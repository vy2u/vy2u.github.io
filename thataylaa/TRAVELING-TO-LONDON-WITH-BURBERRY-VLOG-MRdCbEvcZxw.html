blog off exactly the same as my last one
in the car just got coffee and the bagel
so I am so excited to be going back to
London I leave tomorrow I'm going there
with Burberry I did a vlog the last time
I went with them but I am just so
honored to be going back with them when
I saw that email I was literally in
shock like I read it like five times
I'll have the first London blog link
down below but this time they sent over
the itinerary and it looks like it's
gonna be insane so I am very excited I'm
getting there a couple days early again
to do my own thing I land in London at 7
a.m. their time and then I have I guess
like oh wait drove to I think I'm 2 full
days basically to do my own thing and
then I meet up with them and go to their
hotel and everything on the 18th I've
just been running around getting it
things waxed doing laundry packing
trying to get videos done and
pre-recorded so I have three ready to go
for next week so when I'm gone you guys
are gonna still have Monday Wednesday
Friday videos in my time 15 days of
foundation ends tomorrow so I'm gonna be
bringing the foundations to try out
there again and wear different combos
these things are just always so surreal
because when I think back to when I
started YouTube none of this was like
even in my mind at all you know I was
just doing YouTube to do YouTube it
wasn't a job for anyone yet and trips
weren't a thing just evolved so much
over the years and I'm just so thankful
to be able to freakin go to London with
a brand like Burberry it's just crazy so
I'm gonna bring you guys along here we
go
London what month is it September 2017
here we go
okay so I am in London it has actually
been a slightly rough start to the trip
the flight was great I watched like 9
episodes of blacklist didn't sleep at
all probably bad call I got in at 7 a.m.
basically like a string of bad luck
started happening very long story short
7 a.m. here on the 17th
so basically yesterday the 16th when I
got in i ended up not getting in my room
until like 6 hours later while i was
waiting for the room to get ready i got
a migraine so i ended up just paying to
upgrade my room so that i could get in a
bed with my pain pills didn't work
didn't end up actually sleeping i
haven't slept in over what 36 hours now
but one of my pain pills can finally
kicked in i'm gonna go try and eat
something and just like get outside and
i want to go walk through Hyde Park and
see if I can loosen up my neck and
shoulders and everything I'm excited to
be in London ended up in a handicapped
room because I was the only room they
had available so my sink is like super
mini don't even know if you can see this
like for size reference I'm a small
person but like this thing cause like
the size of my hand it's all good so
basically I have just today now I
thought I was gonna have two full days
yesterday didn't happen so I have today
so the hotel that I booked and then
tomorrow I meet up with burglary go to
their hotel and everything which I'm
super excited for I used to app like
post mates called delivery I think I'm
just got a kale salad with avocado some
chicken and then these like potato wedge
things potato wedges are bum
about
in Hyde Park right now it is so
beautiful it's pretty dead I think this
is so early and it's like a Sunday but
some of the trees are starting to change
color and there's a little like a pond
thing over there and about to go to like
salons or whatever those are
this is so crazy it might just like
casually rather than you buy it with
nothing
as I run add entry I'm still going
through Hyde Park I found this really
cute cafe right by the water called
light oak cafe got coffee it's gone
feeling pretty good right now feels good
like super crisp and cold feels like
Seattle weather actually it's probably
like 50 degrees right now might be yeah
it's just super peaceful in here and I
think I've walked around like almost a
little park by now probably gone like
funny one out for miles
mmm smells like Washington okay so I
came back here to get a jacket and I
ended up falling asleep for five hours
so at least ice left but it's now 6 p.m.
so I have to go get tired again so I can
fall asleep tonight and like actually
sleep but I'm staying in Doubletree
Hilton which is right across the street
from Hyde Park so it's really close to
Notting Hill in Kensington
so I think I'm gonna try and walk and
find some sushi sushi sounds really good
right now I need to hop on the computer
later and finish up Monday's video I
don't really want to bring my laptop
this is heavy so I might just come back
here afterwards and work also Sunday so
I feel like a lot of places will be
closed early I park this morning was
friggin beautiful definitely would
recommend
okay just picked up a pizza from franca
monka I got good reviews let's see it
looks like ooh that's a big so I'm going
to eat and then work and then hopefully
be tired so I can get back on a normal
sleep schedule
okay guys I just got to the new hotel
that Burberry put us in oh my god I have
no words I'm like so excited right now
my heart I'm gonna like start back
this hotel is freakin insane we're
staying at the NED I'll show you guys
the rest of it cuz I think we're doing
like a tour later but this room gotta
give you a room tour there's a freaking
bathtub I just don't really the sir I'm
pretty sure this is like the suite
because it is freaking huge let's start
from the beginning walking in oh my god
it's insane by the way I finally put on
makeup and clothes for the first time in
like three days I'm wearing my like cap
sleeve shirt thing I got from Roth
t.j.maxx leather jacket from H&amp;amp;M these
are my new jeans from three people that
I hauled in that and the haul video okay
so you walk in there's like chargers and
adapters in here the guy were showing me
look at these freaking wood floors so
beautiful so that's like the bedroom
area there's a whole closet right here
at this bathroom isn't seen such
beautiful tile there's white marble over
here gold hardware look at this counter
here's the shower they're stocked up
with cowshed I've never heard of that
brand but I guess is what their Spa is
to bring their spa carries so pretty
also I was looking for the toilet for
like two minutes then realized this
right here little antique mirror and
then you walk out of here and here's
where the magic is oh my gosh there's
like this whole would even call this
chest bar thing the food in there it
looks like there's like oh I definitely
thought that was a face mask I think
that's chocolate I totally forgot I
wanted to bring a lush bath bomb because
I've had a feeling that was gonna be a
bath I definitely forgot that but I'm
pretty sure they have us stocked up over
here look at this bed literally looks
like the Queen's bed or something
chandelier I have my laptop and stuff
here's the window so pretty oh my god
there's like perks you haven't really
looked out here yet let's see what kind
of see there is I'm like going behind
the tree right looks like I face
in Word the buildings in London are so
prettiest I am pretty sure there's not a
single ugly building next trying to find
good lighting in here in the shower that
looks good
oh okay no there's officially no good
lighting here so we're essentially are
pretty sure most people will be flying
in today so tonight it's kind of like
the chill may we're all doing dinner
together downstairs there's like tons of
restaurants in this hotel and then
tomorrow on the next day we have like
two full days of planned things which
will be really fun tonight's dinner for
the dress code it was very British what
did they say it was smart smart casual I
would really don't know what to do with
myself right now I'm so excited okay I
just finished up doing my hair I went up
to the roof to get it like a matcha
latte
I tried out their flat iron to curl my
hair and this is really good it's the
babble Asst curled it really nicely I
just really need to wash my hair right
now so you use my Elizabeth and James
black dry shampoo okay so I think this
is gonna be the outfit of the night it
is so hard to find light in here like it
was a rough doing my makeup my camera is
like doing the low light things I think
you guys can actually see better but
here's the outfit I'll show you guys me
actually great lighting these were the
pants from Macy's that I showed in the
haul video the issues I got a long time
ago I think they were from Holika store
I get most of my shoes this white tank
top is also from Macy's this cami is
from American Eagle this is from Etsy
this is Bryan Anthony's this jean jacket
is digimax I don't even know what my
makeup looks like because I can't really
see it
I just got back into the room and look
what was on the bed where are you at
light switch oh I think that's the one
but oh got it this bad boy was on
the bed with a cute little note even
this paper feels fancy I was taking a
little Instagram stories thing I haven't
opened this yet obviously but this is
friggin heavy oh my gosh it's probably
weighs like 30 pounds so I'm really
curious what's in here okay wait step1
I'm gonna order food step two I'm gonna
get in PJs step three we're gonna open
this step one done mac and cheese lemon
tart rosy okay that wasn't very graceful
kind of get a movie shot
this coffee is actually bomb calm I've
been using this little soap dish as like
a mixing palette improvising I forgot my
ballot
I'm still trying out foundations for 15
days of foundation so I'm gonna do the
Estee Lauder Double Wear nude today
mixed with Marc Jacobs remarkable in 110
this will help lighten it and add some
coverage and I'm thinking that one will
hopefully give it that skin finish still
cuz this one's a little bit heavy on its
own so that's what I'm gonna try and
waiting for breakfast to come up here I
have about two hours to get ready so I
should be good my hair is pretty much
done I just need to do my face and
dressed in things
hey young I got an omelet a little
cinnamon roll coffee and watch Jesus I
have been like literally in the window
do my makeup here's the makeup outfit
situation oh and then blue come on white
balance this one is from rocksbox this
one is dog-eared duggard the shirts from
forever 21 you guys will have already
seen the fall haul so I showed this and
that and then I have on the same
American Eagle bralette watch is fossil
and I'm just wearing those jeans that I
showed also from three people in that
hole so I didn't open up this bag last
night so we're gonna do it right now
so there's three separate bags oh this
feels like a bag the bag in the bag holy
 these are you kidding me oh my gosh
there's a purse in here what the heck oh
actually I love this color and the
yellow hell yeah
this would be a good like I was gonna
say beach bag but I don't think you want
to take Burberry to the beach this is
insane
this feels like makeup it's pretty heavy
from hoping there's a lip liner in here
because I realize didn't bring one and
I'm wearing the Sephora 32 liquid
lipstick which is like super freakin
nude and middle if they're kind of
invisible right now woo we have a few
different boxes in here oh my gosh
there's a lot in here
oh yeah there's a lip product in here I
have like 10 minutes before have to head
down there so probably don't have time
to go through all this right now but
there's an eye palette this packaging is
super pretty ooh a nail polish got some
nice fall colors in there magnetic
closure on these are so nice
perfect okay I'm gonna use this one in
the highlight I'm wearing is the
Burberry fresh flow I'm obsessed with
this this is the only highlight I
brought on this trip this is in the
shade number three pink pearl there we
go getting some shape in there this is
the super heavy thing I have a feeling
this is perfume also I'm so glad to play
with all that makeup Thank You Burberry
this is insane the candle oh my gosh and
that's black amber I'm so excited right
now I love amber kind of sense the
Elizabeth and James black like that same
dry shampoo I showed you guys I have the
candle version of that and it's like my
favorite scent oh my gosh it's just so
pretty
I'm Way too excited about this candle
look at that I just sprayed perfume so
it's like hard for me to smell what's
what right now but I think it smells
really good dude my bag is definitely
gonna be over 50 pounds and then there's
the my Burberry blush I've never smelt
this the packaging is beautiful look at
this bottle I spray this on paper you
know when you spray perfume then you
can't smell anything
mmm
smells very rosy flowery really fresh
super fruity actually not that I I'm
sniffing this paper for like 20 minutes
you guys are insane thank you so much so
excited about this candle okay now I
actually got to go down okay we're
inside
okay so today it was amazing
I'm gonna tell you guys about it later
because I am so freaking nauseous right
now I don't know if I got food poisoning
from something or what happened but I've
been like in the bathroom probably TMI
we have a dinner thing in a half hour
I'm gonna wait like 15 more minutes and
see if there's some kind of miracle that
this passes through okay so it is the
next morning last night it was a little
rough but I'm feeling a little bit
better right now but we're having a bull
by day today
I'm so excited having this like private
bathroom shower room right now we're
about to get a massage and I want to do
a manicure and pedicure and then we can
just like chill and use the sauna and
everything so I'm excited it's gonna be
fun just I have a massage that was so
nice so it's rich oh that's pretty cool
like 10 things she really got in there I
was not prepared mentally or physically
save lives in the spa in the head
and they sell cowshed products and there
was this like spearmint exfoliation
thing manikanta get it was like super
intense my skin feels so soft right now
thank you okay I think I might have just
got ready the fastest I've ever gotten
ready in my life just got back up from
the whole spa day thing which was
amazing I'm like so relaxed right now
showered did my makeup got dressed and
now we're about to go out to dinner with
everyone this is the final night in
London sad well let me show you my
outfit on my lips I used I just put it
away so the Burberry liquid lipstick and
plum plum I'll have it down below so
this is like a wrap dress kind of thing
this black one it's like short sleeve
this is from cotton on it was like 10
bucks and then this sweater is from
boohoo I showed it in that hole and I
think the length will work especially
like with the dress I think it's fine
it's like a coat I thought it might be a
little bit too long at first these are
the shoes I've just been wearing this
whole time actually I think these are oh
these are Franco Sarto it's like one of
my favorite shoe brands I have like five
billion because he makes size fours and
then watch Daniel Wellington hair is
just in like a curly ponytail kind of
thing well like fallen over but anyways
I feel like we need to chat they haven't
actually talked to you guys that much
about what's been going on so yesterday
was like a full day of going to the
Burberry show room which is that the old
sessions house this collection I feel
like was really funky and just different
and I loved how the photographs like
went with it they had old photographs
all over the walls it was in an old
courthouse just like super cool building
and just like loved the vibe and
everything I went to the Burberry
flagship store which is like a palace
literally today was amazing just like
super well organized too so shout out to
the Burberry team because you guys made
an awesome itinerary every
thing was just like boom-boom-boom just
really well thought out and everything
then I think next was the manicure so I
had to lock on so we kind of like file
down the shellac and then put this
Burberry color overtop which I'll have
the exact color link down below then we
all had lunch together by the way
there's like seven people so it's a lot
smaller than last time we came out with
them so it's really cool to actually get
to like spend more time with people
everyone's super chill and nice I don't
think anyone really used like the pool
or Sun or anything then we got to do
like a one-on-one makeup thing with
Wendy ro which was just unreal like last
time she taught a master class in front
of like 40 people I want to say and it
was just really cool to actually have
her touch my face since I'm creepy at
all
and I could just like ask her whatever
questions I wanted so that was really
cool is in like this sweet room unlike
the sixth floor there was a spiral
staircase in the room it was insane I
should have got shots of the room things
are like I could fly away with these
let's go eat
Oh
this was just sitting on our
okay just got back to safety
pilgrim the car is coming at 5:20 a.m.
probably got like 4:45 it's 12 a.m.
right now so I'm debating just pulling
an all-nighter you're not sleeping so we
will see but tonight was really fun just
such a good group of people will just
feel like it's rare with a brand but
literally all of the people on the
Burberry team I probably met like five
people more than that on the Burberry
team this time and they're all just so
nice so sweet genuine so just a great
group of people it's time like bloggers
and the Burberry team and dinner was
amazing we like rented out this top
floor of a restaurant I am stuffed we
ate like ten meals so flight back to
Seattle tomorrow take a nine hour flight
I think I just went to download
blacklist and they don't have it in me
okay so I'm gonna find a new show or
podcast or something they download for
the plane even though hopefully I'll be
passed out of sleep I love going back
because you gain half a day so great
it's like traveling and I'm yeah I'm not
really awake right now so I'll probably
see you back in Seattle thank you so
much to Burberry for having me here it's
been literally like a dream between the
hotel I'm just everything they planned
out okay any doors my face I need to go
to bed you can stop vlogging so let's
see you guys in Seattle alright so I'm
back in Seattle I don't even know what
day it is come easy I was doing pretty
good with jet lag like the first day and
then last night I was wide awake until
6:30 a.m. so it's now super late in the
day it's almost 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday
and I just got a Krispy Kreme because
I'm craving donuts some coffee
got some donuts that's some kind of
pumpkin one in tray
heaven so the first day back I actually
filmed and was like totally fine didn't
feel jet-lagged at all supposed to wake
up early from the foundation Friday

Etsy not Zee essence makeup so I'm gonna
go to a couple different Fred Meyers and
