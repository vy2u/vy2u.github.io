smoothie while I do this alright so
today we're trying out some green Beauty
makeup products green Beauty in the past
couple years I feel like has gotten a
lot more popular than it was in the past
there are some green beauty brands
carried at Sephora now and no Free
People has a pretty decent green beauty
section on their website with makeup and
skincare and all that kind of stuff I
picked up all the stuff from detox
market this is not sponsored by detox
market but I actually reached out to
them and they ended up letting me pick
out some stuff from their site to try
out in this video so not sponsored not
getting paid to do this I recently did a
video trying out Whole Foods makeup I
also have a video trying out Etsy makeup
and I got a few comments from you guys
saying check out detox market so what I
gathered as I was doing some googling
for this video is that there's not
really one definition that I could find
of what green beauty is but basically
there are certain qualifications and
things that people look for that usually
classify something as a green beauty or
green makeup product no parabens no
synthetic fragrances no formaldehydes
for my understanding just because it's
green doesn't mean it's necessarily
vegan without some brands who are green
and vegan cruelty free gluten free all
of that good stuff
makeup I'm trying to learn more about
just what ingredients to look out for
that you don't want in makeup I know
there are certain apps like I think it's
called ink dirty this video is almost a
full face of green makeup the only two
things I use that weren't are lashes and
bronzer everything else I picked up on
that site so I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you're excited for it don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby toe
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time alright my ovaries feel like
they're falling out of my body right now
who loves that time of the month have my
box here I love how they package this it
looks very like minimalist here so I got
a couple different foundations first of
all I had no idea what I was gonna be in
the shade so the first time I got is the
vapor organic Beauty atmosphere luminous
foundation I think this is a stick
foundation I got the lightest shade zero
nine zero and then I also got 110 110
definitely looks dark okay 90 looks good
let's try 90 I also got another stick
foundation this is the narcissist
foundation cream you want to go with
this vapor luminous one let's see what
it says about this made with wind power
so 70% or
ingredients 30% minerals and essential
oils hopefully it doesn't break me out
my skin breaks out and get sensitive to
a lot of oils my desk right now has a
layer of makeup literally about this
high on it so I can't find my clips
we're just gonna do a behind the ear
here hoping this is luminous oh oh
crumble in a little bit and use my Sigma
f80 to round top this one my favorite
brushes to use with stick foundation
since it is so dense
smells like organic makeup I want to see
what kind of coverage they say this is
on line it says the coverage is medium
and easily buildable it's off that first
layer definitely looking like light
coverage but we'll see if it builds over
something my scarring and stuff it does
glide on really easily sides looking
like very light coverage that looks
pretty bad on my forehead as I say it's
buildable so let's try and build this up
I might try a sponge with this mmm I'm
gonna stick with the brush I'm good safe
to say this is light coverage and it's
not really covering my redness at all on
my nose on me it's just kind of like
bringing forward all my pores maybe a
setting spray will help with this one
but I'm gonna first try I think I got a
concealer so I can conceal the under
eyes and conceal some of the redness
going on that the foundation didn't
cover at all this is a cute packaging I
like the pink
I hope this yeah K cool so this is
perfecting concealer in the shade fair
zero one just by hint Beauty feels nice
and creamy I'm gonna try this underneath
the eyes I like the shade it feels nice
and creamy without being thick like it
feels very lightweight but it does feel
creamy and kind of moisturizing huge
difference between that side and that
side obviously oh yeah it's totally
drying I'm setting a little bit actually
covered my dark mist pretty well you can
still see some darkness coming through
there but that looks pretty good
I'm going to use this to kind of go down
the center of my face just to brighten
everything up and hopefully help out
this situation going on I would say it's
a high medium low full coverage
concealer I mean I can still see
freckles and stuff coming through
not gonna give you like shape tape kind
of coverage feel like you just talked
about this concealer for like 25 minutes
okay so this one I'm really curious
about says it's a bio brightener
invisible powder by the well people and
I hope I'm saying that right well people
it says Universal glow I like glowy
powders so I'm hoping this gives a nice
glow to the face under percent natural
it says this sheer velvety soft powder
creates radiance minimizes pores and
blurs imperfections for a youthful
glowing complexion but has aloe in it
which I like okay let's try this out I
need all the smoothing and blurring we
can get right now
that's the only powder I have so I'm
gonna try this for underneath my eyes
too and then also all over the face
loose powders can be really hit or miss
for me okay so it is one of those
powders for me that just totally took
away the coverage under there it looks
so much darker than this side it
definitely doesn't look brightening
under there but hopefully this looks
better on the rest of my face then it
just did underneath my eye I think you
guys can see that but it definitely just
darkened it and it basically just took
away all that coverage up the concealer
right there so see how this does down
here oh yeah okay so this is one of
those powders that just totally takes
away the coverage for me okay I'm gonna
try using my sponge because you really
can't go down from here just to brighten
this up hopefully okay that kind of
brightened it I'm not seeing really any
kind of glow actually meant to film the
intro for this one without the full face
on but then I just got too excited we
just started doing makeup so got it on
my sponge here let's try it looking a
little bit splotchy okay this one just
isn't for my skin but I'm definitely
gonna skip my forehead with this one
because I prefer a glowy or forehead
thought I had a bronzer but I guess not
let's go in for brows this is the Eco
brow defining wax Frieda soft black this
looks like a little dip brow type of
product a pomade ooh I like the shade of
this it's like a rich brown but not too
ashy doesn't feel like quite as thick if
senses like the anastacio dipbrow is
kind of like glides over okay that one I
would totally use again I really like
the shade of that I don't have a bronzer
in here to try out so I'm just gonna use
a cosmetics bye-bye porous bronzer for
sure feeling a little bit more alive
here now it's going with blush where did
I just put that blush this is the lily
lolo tickled pink pressed blush oh I
like this packaging very sleek shade
looks really pretty in the pan looks
like it has a little bit of a glow to it
Oh what does it smell like I can't put
my finger on it corn starch maybe that
shade looks pretty though has this light
glow to it which I like it doesn't look
shimmery though it is a pretty light
blush you can see there so it's almost
just giving me like a wash of kind of
sheer pink with a little bit of a glow
everything's kind of looking a little
bit muddy down here so I'm gonna use the
powder since that's what we're working
with here and just try and kind of clean
that up a little bit so I'm just gonna
take the pointed kind of edge of my
sponge and just carve out a little bit
just to clean up any blush or bronzer
that was down there and then I'll go and
play brush between the foundation and
the powder things are looking a little
bit splotchy
okay this I'm excited try highlighter
here this is the Alima pure highlighter
in the shade whisper I think this is the
pressed one oh no I guess it's a loose
one wow this is a giant loose
highlighter here this is huge for a
highlighter wow that would take you ten
years to go through it looks like a
light pink kind of shade which I usually
like okay I like a very subtle skin like
glow and that is what this is giving you
can kind of see it sitting there but I
think that's because of the products
that are underneath ooh that's pretty
kind of almost like melts into your skin
a bit okay feeling this one almost feel
like you might be able to use this like
I used the jcat pearl Luminizer and just
mix in a dab of this with like a face
powder because of the way it just kind
of melts
if you want to make a face powder a
little bit more glowy heck yeah
okay Wow like haven't said heck in a
while I'm just adding more I'm into this
I'm gonna spritz my whole face right now
this is the rose water and glycerin
spray I hate the sprayer on this thing
but it gives you a nice glow I really
need to just pour this into another
bottle that has a better spritzer cuz
this one is pretty crappy sell that one
at Whole Foods too but I just got off of
Amazon I have an eyeshadow palette to
try out here this is by the same brand
as a blush lily lolo like the packaging
really like the weight in black it looks
like there's a pretty kind of army green
shade in here right here man my doll
today does not want to work all right
really low low let's do this I can't
really tell this is matte kind of looks
matte looks like there might be one
matte shade in here right here so
there's not really a transition shade or
anything so I'm just gonna use my same
bronzer that I use so that we have
something to put into my crease these
two look really similar those two almost
look like identical I'm really drawn to
these two right here where I could do
the green and the gold I'm gonna start
out with that deep shade the brown and
hope this is Matt okay so don't actually
think that's matte it looks quite a bit
lighter on the eye than it is in the pan
yeah this has a slight shimmer to it is
kind of like satin not blending the best
this one you definitely have to kind of
build up and when you blend a bit of the
pigment gets lost you kind of just have
to keep building and blending so I
really can't decide if I want to do this
gold I've done a lot of kind of cool
tone looks lately so I think I am
actually gonna take the gold let's do it
I'm just gonna press this on with my
finger to start it definitely aren't
like the most pigmented eyeshadows but
they are soft and you have to layer them
up quite a bit I'm going to try and wet
this might be an eyeshadow that just
needs to be wet a little bit not doing a
whole lot for me I'm gonna go back and
with that Brown since it is so sheer
just to blend this out for the inner
corner I'm actually gonna go back on
that face highlight and wet this to try
and get an inner corner highlight since
it looks like you're not something quite
light enough in that palette my mic
better
ever since my mic died in the filming of
I think that was actually the wholefoods
video wolfies makeup I checked my mic
literally every two minutes to make sure
it's on so if you wet that that's really
pretty that's an inner corner highlight
it so for the lower lash line I'm gonna
go back on that same brown shade so have
the mascara is this an eyeliner mascara
oh I have a liquid eyeliner okay this
isn't the shade 0:07 I think it's just
black I hope looks like my kind of brush
it feels like a firmer brush right there
here's a little bit rough going on okay
so it's not super opaque it is one that
you have to work with the brush feels
pretty rough I like a firmer brush so
it's easier to kind of get that wing and
get the line you want but it does feel a
little bit scratchy almost and it isn't
the blackest black I did have to work
with that quite a bit to get kind of an
opaque line and it still isn't super
opaque in parts like one of those that
the line just keeps getting bigger
because it's really difficult to get a
smooth edge this wing I think is a
little bit bare but honestly if I try
and go back in with this I'm gonna have
eyeliner up to my eyebrow and pop on
some false lashes and I'll be right back
alright so my lashes are on I just used
pure jetsedder lashes these ones are
cruelty free too now we're moving on to
lips where did I just put it seriously
I've already lost this thing like ten
times I'm so confused
I just put it in for me where did you
just go oh so for lips I'm trying out
the RMS Beauty wild with desire lipstick
this is in the shade breathless Armus
Beauty a belief is carried yeah they're
carried on Sephora now I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna try it without a lip liner oh
wow it's like a peach feels nice and
moisturizing and kind of creamy on the
lips I'm gonna roll this up and try and
use the tip of this to kind of line I
literally can't even see
you can do this with like a regular
shaped lipstick - you just rolled up and
use the tip and you can kind of line
your lips that way doesn't smell
necessarily good but doesn't smell like
bad or anything and I don't really smell
it on my lips those are all of the green
Beauty things that I picked up obviously
we had some rejects but I have a couple
things here that I would totally use
again I think my top thing from all this
was the highlight the Alima pure
highlight I'm excited to use this skin
like I want to reach for this again
right now if it looks this good on top
of this shitty base and it's probably
gonna look even better on top of my
normal face products oh also forgot to
say as I was putting on the false lashes
I think I brushed back my banks or
something in the eyebrow product
actually slid like up here so I
definitely wouldn't say this eyebrow
product is transfer proof or anything if
you're like touching your face or
sweating or anything I'm assuming it
would just rub right off this is one of
those eyebrow products that I could use
that product that I tried in the hot
look makeup video where it was like the
eyebrow sealer you just brush it on over
any kind of eyebrow product and it just
like locks it in there and almost makes
it like waterproof so that could be
something that I could use on top of
this or just a brow gel like the clear
brow gel or something that's just gonna
lock in the product more because it will
kind of slide around and come off blush
is another thing that I would totally
reach for again again this is more of a
subtle blush so don't get this thinking
it's like a super pigmented blush or
anything I would almost call this more
of like a glowy blush topper the
concealer I didn't mind out try this out
again with my normal powders and that
would probably go hopefully a lot better
if there are any other green beauty
products I should try out let me know
what your favorites are down below
definitely open to doing another video
do still use the blush that I tried out
in the Whole Foods video and usually in
these type of videos I do find like one
or two products that I still use so
maybe you should do a video on that I'll
have everything I tried link down below
in the description box also link the
Whole Foods video and the Etsy video
because both of those are also more
green natural kind of makeup so link
those videos down below too but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up I
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
