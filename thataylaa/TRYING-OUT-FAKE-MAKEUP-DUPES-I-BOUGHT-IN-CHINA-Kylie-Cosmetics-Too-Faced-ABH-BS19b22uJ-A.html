to filming since my big three week trip
I'm actually only in Seattle for a few
days and I leave again but it feels so
good to be sitting down and filming
everything that you guys have been
seeing has been pre-recorded so I've
still been having three videos a week go
out they've just been pre-recorded felt
so bizarre setting up all of my filming
stuff this morning remember how to get
my camera situated so for those of you
don't know I went to China and Taiwan I
have a vlog up of China Taiwan vlogs is
going to be coming like the Thai the
vlog over here if you haven't seen it
but while I was there we went to this
place called the fake market I don't
think that's technically what it's
called but they had a few different make
up kind of stores in there I had
literally every kind of knockoff fake
dupe that you could imagine they had
collabs like youtuber collabs they had
the man you immunised with nem you a
makeup geek lab they had at a beauty
stuff Haile they had I mean they had
everything so I picked up a bags and now
lift bags of a bunch of stuff that I
thought would be fun to try out and see
how it compares to the actual whole
products tried to pick up products that
I already own just so I know how they do
compared to the real thing
bading doing half face the real products
and half face of dupes but it has a few
videos like that so I think we're just
in try out the dupes on my full face cam
please I'm actually filming right now
I'm just kind of in shock Before we jump
into it if you're new here don't forget
to join the favorito family and
subscribe I upload Monday Wednesday
Friday is 6cm fifth time foundation
Friday is returning this Friday six
campus of time I know you guys have been
it's a Matt come in already wash
moisturize and prime my face but I am
going to do foundation and stuff on
camera because I got a Beauty Blender
dupe and all this stuff by the way you
have to majorly haggle in the fake
market so if you go to China and go to
this place do not pay what they tell you
a friend speaks fluent Chinese so he did
all the hagwons left that up to him but
I think we got a pretty good deal I
think I paid about 25 bucks for all this
stuff Beauty Blender so picked up the
Beauty Blender dupe I have my real
Beauty Blender right here this one is
obviously a bit dirty just so you can
see them dry how the size compares this
one is quite a bit bigger so I'm going
to go wet this thing but I just wanted
to show you what the packaging looks
like they even have like a little lure
sticker on here which I thought was
funny
let's undo this thing
see how it feels this is this prepare to
the real Beautyblender this thing feels
very stiff but let's see how it goes
once I wet it I'm gonna let this thing
I'll be right back
so I wet the real beauty blender - just
to see you guys saw how much smaller the
real beauty blender was before check
this out so after damping both of them
is squeezing out the water the real
Beauty Blender is definitely much bigger
now this one I don't think actually got
any bigger and it is extremely stiff I'm
going to squeeze them with the same
pressure so you can see let's try it
with foundation I'm going to try mixing
the land content I don't ultra the
lightest shade 90 ivory
what's the dermablend smooth liquid camo
and linen this one is very pink and
light so this one's super yellow so
we'll see how it mixes a heaven excuse -
before all the traveling and eating and
everything that I've been doing the past
few weeks my skin hasn't been too bad I
mean I am still breaking out has my
normal acne but I haven't been worse
than usual so I was good so paranoid
bullshit
yep literally right when I said that my
battery on my knife just went red though
life is awesome video battery alright
that thing is a frickin Beast - change
the battery if you have the rode
videomic pro you know what I'm talking
about
as literal YouTube videos on how to
change the battery because it's not
ridiculous but I think we're in business
let's do this that's just literally
soaked so that's soaked up I would say
80% of the product and if you want to
feel like you're hitting a rock on your
face this one is a way to go this one is
definitely a no this is ridiculously
hard the foundation combo should give me
about medium to full coverage and I'm
definitely getting light coverage with
this because it's soaking up a ton of it
so I'm going to switch to the Beauty
Blender for the rest of my face okay I
actually preferred the Real Techniques
sponge over the Beauty Blender so if
you're looking for an affordable option
that one's really good I like the Nick
sponge as well and I have lash expensive
on so I'm not going to be putting false
lashes on today but I just have to be
kind of careful around the eye area I'm
going to finish up my foundation
concealer powder so that we can move on
to the next
dupe products all right so my base is
now on I also want
to say since I realize didn't say it in
the intro of course the ingredients in
these products are probably not the best
you don't really know what's actually in
them which is why a lot of times when
you buy makeup on eBay that's really
cheap you don't really know what you're
getting I just think this is a fun video
to try out hopefully I don't get any
allergic reactions or anything today's a
little find out we're ballsy's at this
point next up I found the Anastasia dip
brow pomade this looks legit you guys
there's even a barcode on the end so
again even if you think you're buying
box products on eBay or whatever just be
aware that it could be totally fake
because this one looks I mean pretty
legit and it is definitely not so this
is in the shade medium brown here's what
the box looks like so I've used the dip
brow for years so I know how the normal
one goes on this looks so friggin
similar I couldn't find my normal one
but I feel like most of you guys know
what it looks like this looks and feels
pretty much identical the top lid might
be a little bit more cheapy plastic but
the base feels like nice glass I'm going
to use an angled brush to try this out
aren't you going to comb through my
brows first lately to do my brows I've
been using the sky the benefit precisely
my brow haven't used a pomade in a while
on like a regular basis okay so this is
very smooth this is in creamy nicely I
think this one is a bit more glossy
almost when light hits my eyes my brows
look a little bit shiny but it's going
on really creamy and smooth alright so
that one was good my brows Devon it was
a little bit shiny like I have some
Vaseline on them or something but other
than that that went on really smooth and
totally fine so I think I'm gonna do my
eyeshadow first and then move on to the
rest of my face so they had the modern
renaissance palette here's the fake one
here's the real one I'm going to undo
the plastic on this thing I love the
modern renaissance palettes one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes
fake one also has felt tops the top one
is the safe line and the bottom one is
the real one also in the real one you
get a back sticker that lists the
ingredients and everything here's the
inside the top is the fake one for the
most part the shades look pretty similar
there's definitely a few that look
totally different the burnt orange
shades which are second over this is
real
second overlooked totally different
goobers like a champagne kind of gold
shade in the real palate and in this one
it's like a pink warm taupe is
definitely more purple I would say half
of the shades in the pan looks pretty
close we'll see how it looks on the eyes
I probably my eyes using the Revlon
Colorstay cream eyeshadow in the shade
the 7:15 this is just like a brown
because I think I want to do like a warm
brown look you're gonna shadow with lash
extensions is kind of a pain in the ass
not going to be keeping these extensions
on I just still have one more thing that
I'm going to after that trip I'm going
to be just letting them fall out so that
I can film normal did a whole video
about the lashes this in the side
I think I'm gonna go in with the golden
okra shade right here to start is
probably the closest to transition shade
I'll get in here really curious to see
how this formula this is going to be
blending out very easily I need to get
breakfast why do I always think filming
on an empty stomach good idea we want to
take some burnt orange right here and
I'm going to put that into the crease a
little bit to warm it up they don't feel
as soft in the pan as the real ones do
they're blending out really easily and
they definitely have pigment to them we
don't have that buttery consistency to
them but I wouldn't say they're stiff
I'm going to take a tiny bit of real
gear which is that pretty much orange
shade I was not that pigmented it's
adding a little bit of warmth it's not
nearly as intense as it is in the pan
right over it looks and feels pretty
nice I think I'm just going to take that
on my finger first to apply it just put
this right on my lid not one is nice and
tight mented I'm going to blend it out
with a brush after
I've almost Cypress and very put that
into the crease okay this one doesn't
look nearly I starts this is like a warm
dark brown not showing up a whole lot
honest I want to do waterline eyeliner
but I'm going to bring some of the I
think golden ochre shade the first one
went in with down on the bottom I'm
gonna try some of the raw Sienna shades
I think I do need some water lines
eyeliner so I'm going to pop on some of
that put on some of my liquid eyeliner
I'm probably just going to do a little
wings maybe I have a whole video on how
I do my winged liner incise want to see
that link down below alright so just
finish off the eyes I just added some
black eyeliner on the waterline and some
eyeshadow down there and the blood is
out again with gold and ochre on the
bottom put on some bottom mascara and
now we're gonna do the rest of my face
I found the fish brush this thing has
been going around on Instagram mostly
all over the place now I'm not sure
which brand came out with at first but I
found one for $14 this thing I
definitely did not pay $14 for this is
probably a dollar to full fancy so the
plastic thing on top actually that's
smart
so this might be intended for some
nation now that I'm thinking about it
but it feels very stiff think I'm going
to try it as a contour brush I got the
rose gold shade they had like a black
one in a few different colors and tries
out with my mu a bronze perfection matte
bronzer I've been obsessed with this
thing distance picked up a ton of powder
so nothing really happens when I
feathered us it's pretty stiff so kind
of just do on that line guess it's
slightly blending out now but I feel
like I'm rubbing off my foundation since
you have to push so hard not the best
for contouring I mean you got that line
on there you just can't blend it out so
I'm going to go in with my normal onto
our brush I use let it just get really
nice Lee which is a wet and wild one
from the drugstore man that line is like
on there my powder brush and shine this
one might be good for like a nose
Condors and so it is pretty stiff and
has kind of a slim line they can make
that with they had the fake sweet peach
glow kit have the real one right here so
see how the shoes and everything compare
alright we look pretty damn similar
these actually look freakin identical
the fake one is on the top the bottom
one is the real one I think the only
thing that's different is that the
actual color of the peach on this one
might be slightly lighter at the top I'd
like this pallet got kind of mixed
reviews I actually really like this okay
so these colors are definitely a bit
different what is going on with that
shade on the right it's like purple so
the top pallet is the real one the
bottom one is the fake one I don't even
think that's showing up but this shade
is legitimately purple don't ask me how
you're supposed to bring your face with
that the blush shades in the middle are
obviously very different bottom one is
much deeper highly in the bottom looks
much more pink the actual packaging on
the inside looks the same but the baked
one is cardboard this fold is cardboard
and the real one is more of like an
aluminum material some 10 is watching
this bronzer shade right here the purple
watched it looks kind of pretty I don't
think I would use this as a bronzer
contour maybe like a deep kind of blush
shade it's definitely cool tone and it
has glitter flecks in there and I'm
going to try to blush first I'm going to
go in with that purpley shade this is a
little bit patchy like I'm not getting a
whole lot of anything happening we're
going to try the middle shade that's
what I have for blush whoa I don't know
if I can do that this is like a brick
red my skintone this will be straight-up
orange so I think we're going to skip
that alright I'm just going to really go
ham with this purple shade and try and
build it up tinkles something's
happening okay so I'm curious to see how
this team shade is going to be at the
highlight
that's pretty its emphasizing my texture
of it definitely
but that one is definitely the best out
of this whole thing yeah I like that
that's pretty I would use that again Oh
inner corner that's what I wanted to do
I'm gonna go back in with this palette
and I need a little something on my
inner corner I think we're going to try
the shade Vermeer
I love Vermeer on my inner corner in the
real palette so I'm gonna see how this
one works a little sealant on your
mirror for you to feelin this shade
isn't quite as pigmented as the real one
but it's working in Bruntlett so I got a
few different lip options they had a
shit ton of Kylie cosmetics they had the
glasses the lipsticks the Holiday
Collection doll of her collections I
also had jeffree star which I thought
was funny the bhaktas celebrity skin but
I actually got the white one we wanted
to try mixing this in to lighten and you
kind of look sick that normally fake
dragon stars those dragons star on here
chill neon one jeffree star product that
I bought years ago haven't purchased
from France since then they might try
mixing this in with a kylie one I don't
know we'll see
I got Kylie coke okay and candy kay I
think we're going to go in with coke
okay looks exactly the same they even
have Kylie's signature on the back Kylie
who signed in boxes in China
well okay this one looks pretty purple
oh these look these look very similar I
feel like this looks nothing like candy
k does coke okay is right here candy K
is right here they're both very mobs
these looks nothing like the color on
the outside of the box
I think I'm going to do the darker one
so I'm going to go in with Kandy K just
like the real lip hips you get a lip
pencil and a liquid lipstick the pencil
looks nice and brown doesn't go on brown
like a rose color yep filling in my lips
with that and then let's try out the
wand is very very cheap Oh smells good
smells like birthday cake
oh that went on pretty much identical to
the Kylee scent is intense as I'm
getting like lightheaded
I actually like the color with this at
the box the actual product in the tube
and then the product on your lips look
totally different so it's totally
drawing down feels almost exactly like
the colour-pop ultra matte lip so this
is the final look using a fake makeup
from China I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I know it helps me out out
of everything I think I was most
impressed with the fake Modern
Renaissance palette I do really like the
highlight in the sweet peach palette the
kylie lip it also went on just like hers
do I mean it's more of a drying formula
but as far as being similar to the
actual product the way it went on and
everything is the same
the shades are definitely totally
different than the real candy cane Koko
K's the Beauty Blender
total reject I think this was the worst
out of all them and also not that into
this maybe I'll try applying foundation
with this thing but I feel like you just
have to kind of like white again I post
videos every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
