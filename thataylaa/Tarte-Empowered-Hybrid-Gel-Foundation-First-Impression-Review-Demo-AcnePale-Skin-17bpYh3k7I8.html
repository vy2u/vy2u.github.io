sunglasses alright so today we have a
first impression or view video on the
Tarte hybrid gel what does this even
actually called it empowered hybrid gel
foundation so this has one fluid ounce
and it retails for $39 you can get it at
Sephora Ulta pretty much anywhere that
carries Tarte the packaging and the
actual quality of it feels really nice
but this feels like it's a high-end
foundation has a super pretty frosted
glass bottom not the best for traveling
with since this is glass let's go on the
website and read some claims so looking
on altas website there are ten shades
not a whole lot
I've tried to our foundations in the
past and they don't typically have the
best shade range it's kind of
interesting because they also claim in
here
yeah it's available in a range of shades
to match any skin tone ten shades does
not match any skin tone sorry looks like
they have a few dark shades and then
mostly like mill shades this is the
shade fair like neutral you'll see when
I apply it what I think of the shade and
how it looks and everything Thank You
lawnmower hopefully you guys can't hear
that this is the only time that I can
film today so we're going for it oh
great like literally moving us
so says it's a full coverage foundation
oil-free smoothing plumping pore
refining mask redness dark spots acne
uneven skin tone for 12 hour we're
supposed to help smooth the surface of
your skin while promoting water
retention it says it's supposed to wear
fine across all skin types guessing if
you have dry skin this will be great for
you since it is a gel formula is
supposed to be super moisturizing I have
combination skin so I do get oily
throughout my t-zone that's pretty much
it supposed to be moisturizing full
coverage foundation so if you want to
see my thoughts on this foundation and
how wears throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching that
was quite the setup literally just move
that around 20,000 times headband
is like cutting off my circulation I am
so excited to try this out right now
this is probably one of the prettier
packaging I've ever seen when you take
it out of the box it comes in this
gorgeous like frosted glass gold topped
container and then it has this Chevron
along the side I just think this is so
pretty even if I don't like this Onision
I'm just going to like bring this so I
have the shade fair light neutral and
this was the lightest shade I'm hoping
that this is light enough I haven't even
looked at this yet ooh it looks pretty
dark wonderful story of my life
so by the way that this looks we are
definitely going to have to use a
foundation mixer this is pretty damn
hard so if you buy the brush that is
supposed to go along with this
foundation it has like a spatula on one
end and then an angled like foundation
brush on the other and they say to just
use the spatula to like put it on your
face and then blend it out with the
brush in circular motions so I'm just
going to use my finger to dab some of
this on then we'll blend it out this is
supposed to be full coverage so I'm
going to start out with a little bit I
guess and see how far this goes and I
think I'm going to add in some
foundation mixer on top of this as we're
looking pretty dark folks pretty dark
actually I'm going to try one spot
without foundation mixer just to see
what the color looks like but I can
already
going to be dark so using my flat top
kabuki we go ahead and blend it so as to
use circular motions I typically like to
Pat my foundation like this because I
feel like it's best coverage both do
what they say you know definitely dark
it's showing up a lot lighter on camera
I feel like but in real life it's
definitely too dark so I'm going to go
ahead and add a tiny bit more product
and then add some foundation mixer over
top today I'm using the stargazer white
liquid going to be having a mixer video
coming soon about my favorite mixers I'm
just using a tiny bit of this I use this
mixer with my Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and it doesn't seem to alter
the formula a lot so I feel like this
shouldn't throw off the first impression
that much it is like if you blend in
circular motions like they say it is
kind of difficult
I feel like to do that maybe didn't put
enough on but so far it's looking like
medium coverage I'm going to go ahead
and add a bit more product and then also
some mixer over top it feels really nice
on the skin right now like it feels kind
of a little bit cooling so far even with
two layers on this half of my face it
isn't looking like totally full coverage
on me
you can still see freckles showing
through you can still see some of my
acne but the finish looks nice and it's
sitting really nice on the skin like
even in the viewfinder my face is
looking very fresh even with like pretty
much almost three layers on it doesn't
look cakey or anything it layered really
nicely it looks very dewy and almost
like you have like a moisturizer on and
it feels pretty moisturizing on the face
definitely not set yet feel like the
mixer might have sheared it out a little
bit kind of bummed about the shades is
definitely not a fair shade at all like
I don't even know why they're calling it
fair to me this looks like an NC 25
maybe an NC 30 even with the mixer it
still looks pretty dark like definitely
looks
darker than my chest just so you guys
can see so we'll need alight my face
with some concealer and powder so I'm
going to go ahead and do the rest of my
makeup and then we'll be right back
alright so the rest of my makeup is on
didn't do anything exciting because I'm
just going to be working and running
errands today on the lips I'm wearing
color pop she bad no BFF two liner and
then choker overtop I've been wearing
choker every single day I freaking love
this color and to set my face since the
foundation never it still doesn't feel
fully set like it's still kind of sticky
to the touch and some product is coming
off of my fingers I've set the
foundation with a powder and I use the
Maybelline fit me powder because this is
a little bit more pink toned and lighter
and I feel like it definitely helped to
lighten up my whole face like it doesn't
look way too dark now it's doable one
thing I wanted to mention is that it got
super patchy bronzer when I'm trying to
blend out my bronzer like wouldn't blend
out I'm not sure if that just was a spot
where it didn't fully set so it's kind
of catching on the liquid or what but
like this egg was super hard to block
out with bronzer this one was a little
bit tricky too and I feel like it does
look kind of patchy definitely looks
like I'm wearing makeup right now I
don't think it looks fantastic
on my face but I don't think it looks
bad at all so we're just going to wait
and see how it wears throughout the day
it is pretty late in the day already
it's 1214 p.m. because I was working
this morning it says it is supposed to
last for 12 hours so we shall see so I'm
going to show you guys right now what it
looks like in natural lighting so you
can see the color and the finish and
everything
all right so it is now 249 so it's
almost 3 o'clock almost it on for 3
hours and I feel like the foundation
looks so much better as the day has gone
on so far
it just looks less Foundation like I
feel like I look a little bit more dewy
maybe that's why I like it but it's not
oily when I touch my face it does feel a
little bit sticky like we're getting
some oil coming through hoping that's
just the foundation I don't get oily err
but I do like how it looks right now
even with the lightener I do feel like
the shade is a little bit too dark you
can see a difference like in my hairline
and I don't really like that I feel like
it makes it look kind of mask like but
it definitely looks better than it did
when I first applied it and I'm not
getting any mouth lines which is really
nice I usually get those also around the
nose area it's looking pretty good I do
have like a physical therapy appointment
in a few hours for my neck and they
usually work on me face down so that'll
be interesting to see how the foundation
wears throughout that process usually I
look like a hot mess when I come out of
that appointment so we'll see that's at
7 p.m. so 4 hours from now alright so
then I have a little bit of an
unexpected twist it is now 8 p.m. and I
actually just started feeling better had
a really bad migraine so this whole side
of my face was actually on a hot pack
which is why my like Lynch the drama's
right now we're persevering and
finishing out this first impression so
the foundation is pretty much all worn
off on this side of my face but this
side of my face which didn't touch the
pillow at all or anything um looks
pretty good it definitely is a bit oily
and I can feel it like oils coming off
of my finger when I press down I feel
like sometimes a hot pack can make me
oily or too just like by being super hot
so it could be that but its first
impression is literally all over the
place this is my this is my life I've
had a rough past few weeks and thank you
guys for all the snapchat messages I
really post anything about having
chronic migraine just because they don't
really feel the need to and it would
literally be almost every single day but
sometimes it feels good to know that
there are other people out there who are
going through the same thing and I'm
gonna start crying again so thank you
guys for those of you who snapped me and
tweeted me it really means a lot to me
drive my livestream I got a few of you
guys saying that you want to see a video
on migraines and living with chronic
pain and all that good stuff
um I feel like I I feel like in order
for me to make that video we need to
have some kind of like way to help you
guys and I guess it does help by just
knowing that other people also have this
problem but at the same time like I've
been living with these for 12 years and
I don't have any solutions like I
haven't found anything that works for me
yet so I don't know I don't want it to
come across as like a complaining video
because that's not what it would be um
so if you guys are out there who are
going through the same thing let me know
if a video talking about it would be
helpful I'm usually pretty used to it
and just kind of accept that this is
life but I don't know why today like hit
me extra hard I think it's just I have
so much to do right now and my help just
gets in the way of my life like every
single day anyways back to the makeup so
I'm probably gonna try and keep this on
for a couple more hours so you can see
how it looks but it's kind of already
like a hot mess just because how the
night went so we are going to stop
talking about this and I'm going to
check back in a couple hours hopefully
alright it is 9 o'clock so it's only
been an hour since my last check-in but
I think I just need to shower and like
relax and take off my makeup and it's
probably not going to be changing a
whole lot overall thoughts I think I
need to try this out more I do like the
way that this side is sitting on my skin
especially at the end of the night
like it still it's really nice so I am
going to try mixing it in with other
products like I said if you don't have
pale skin then you could just wear this
on its own from what I tried the
coverage is not as intense as like the
Clinique foundation that I just did a
review on which I'll link down below or
the March is remarkable those have way
better coverage I'll call this a medium
buildable sides all the oil that I have
going on my forehead I feel like it
makes your face look really nice and
moisturize and like plump I hope this
was somewhat helpful for you guys even
though we had a little disruption in the
middle of this first impression let me
know foundations you guys want to see
next down below love you guys thanks for
watching see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
