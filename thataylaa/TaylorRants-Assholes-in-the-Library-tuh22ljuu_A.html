library because let me frickin tell you
I've had some weird-ass experiences
there in the past week you might be
thinking it's June it's summer why the
heck are you in the library and I ask
myself that question every day I have a
12 page research paper to write so I'm
writing a freakin research paper when I
should be tanning or in my case Sun
burning on the beach with a freaking
pina colada
I make it sound like I'm living in
Hawaii so in order to get this paper
done I went to the public library
so I'm sitting down trying to write this
paper with my headphones in which is the
international sign for I don't frickin
give a shit about what you're talking
about
when this 30 year old guy at least are
talking to me and this is his
conversation starter it's nice that all
the kids are out for summer now isn't it
I'm sorry are you saying that I'm a mom
or are you saying that I'm not one of
those kids guess fuckin what buddy I'm
20 years old and I'm not out for summer
I'm writing a freakin 12 page research
paper so don't talk to me about either
of those topics so the way I saw it I
could either a ignore the fuck and act
like I didn't hear up be make the Jay
marks face and try to scare him away or
I could just react like a normal human
being and respond so I was like well
shit we're just gonna be sitting here
awkwardly so I gave him my I'm annoyed
as fuck and don't want to talk to you
face and told him that I was writing a
paper because that wasn't apparently
visible to him and this would be one
thing if this third year old guy was
like mildly attractive right and just
like a man cougar but no I'm waiting for
this guy to get the hint that I really
could care less that he went to UC Santa
Barbara tool or that he was in a frat
their biggest freaking tool ever fucking
Lawnmower power tool giant ass hammer
but he kept going at this point I was
like you know what I really need to
finish my paper and I told him that with
words instead of putting his freaking
face back down in his iPad he tells me
that we should get coffee
sometime and asked for my number and I
told him that I have a boyfriend which
is false but it never fails I kid you
not
within 0.2 seconds this was his awkward
as fuck answer to double date sometime
and walks away did you mean that you
have a boyfriend or not quite sure what
that whole thing was but damn want to
come back
you showed me and keep in mind that this
whole thing was in a library where
people don't talk and it's quiet and at
this point people are looking at me like
I'm the jerk that I just like turned
down a guy things ass and why was this
guy in the library not reading by
himself in the first place red flag that
is not a normal activity for a 30 year
old guy so then I go back to writing the
second sentence of my essay thanks -
asshole over there and about 15 minutes
later I hear the song wide awake by Katy
Perry coming out of fucking nowhere at
first I thought it was someone's
ringtone because I was like hah like no
one would be stupid and and considerate
enough to play that in the library but
then I look and it's this freaking fifty
year old lady just watching the music
video Katy Perry on her frickin computer
in the library see these this is the
shit that you put in your ears to hear
things they come out of that box we call
a computer have you never heard of those
before
but now people are like staring at her
thinking that her frickin volume key or
computer is broken nope it was all
fucking working
she was just asshole number two a thing
that I don't understand is what people
don't understand about the library being
a quiet place besides the fact that it's
a place to get books and shit for free
the library is a quiet place if you want
to talk to someone or hit on someone or
listen to frickin Katy Perry go do it in
Starbucks or some shit don't do it in
the library and if your phone rings
there's this thing called a door and you
walk out of it and it takes you outside
you can talk however much your freaking
heart desires outside is this great
concept I wish that there was a library
police how great would that be if
someone's being an asshole or freaking
talking to you you can just press the
emergency library police button in the
freaking library SWAT team will come and
take that douche you share this video on
Facebook if you think that there should
be a library SWAT team we can send it to
Obama we can go all the way why the hell
not
your tax dollars at work thumbs up if
you like this and I'll see you guys in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
