better is if they had a snack break in
the middle that's just my opinion
so today back by popular demand we have
who's excited
so it's senior year of college here's me
over here trying to figure out the
easiest freakin classes I can take to
graduate I literally need elective
credits at this point so I get my
together figure everything out and it
turns out on one credit short so what's
the easiest one credit class I can take
I think to myself yoga people
love yoga it's gotta be great how hard
can downward dog be for 50 minutes twice
a week I can do this well my friends
ain't not knowing two shits about yoga
and all the different strains in breeds
and types pick Kundalini Yoga because I
like the name I couldn't have gone with
gentle yoga or deep breathing yoga or
beginning yoga no I picked Kundalini
Yoga because it reminds me of the word
tortellini which I apparently associate
with good things in my mind so let's
just go to day one of yoga so I'm like
really into this I dig out my yoga pants
think about making some green juice I'm
trying to be very optimistic and ready
to go so I walk into the room and it is
completely matted the floors are matted
the walls have pads all over them the
 ceilings might as well have pads
what is going on here I feel like I'm in
a room where they lock insane people in
and then I was you know trying to remain
optimistic and I was like well this is
cool I don't have to bring a yoga mat
around campus and carry that thing all
day sanitation is highly questionable
but let's overlook that so then my
teacher comes in and she's this older
woman white canvas clothing comes
wearing one of the like I don't even
know what they're called like yogi
turban like hats okay
this is cool I can do this so she sits
in the front of the class and starts to
explain these noise vibrations that
we're going to be making with our mouths
and I'm just over here like trying to
get in crisscross formation with my legs
you're talking about how these noise
vibrations are going to affect our
spiritual mind well I'm like keeping it
open mind I'm trying to like grasp how
that affects your physical mind but then
there's this little invoice inside of me
that's like science you love
science scientific evidence is great I'm
not very good with spiritual things I
have a very practical mind in the
reality of me doing noise vibrations
every single day with my mouth to
increase my spiritual mind is highly
unlikely so then the lady tells us and
keep in mind this is before we have even
begun to move our bodies and do actual
yoga she tells us that we should be
taking ice-cold showers every morning to
awaken the mucous membranes first of all
if you think I'm gonna wake up at 6:30
in the morning and a cold shower is
going to be my motivation to wake up my
mucous membranes
you're batshit crazy took ice cold
showers for a year in Jordan and I'm not
about to voluntarily do that again when
we have access to hot water if you want
to clear out those mucous membranes go
for it good for you good luck trying to
tell 40 college kids to get an ice cold
shower
wrong demographic so then she explains
this thing called Breath of Fire I will
insert a clip right now
I'm over here breathing like I just ran
a freaking marathon about to pass out
and I'm not exaggerating stars were seen
so turns out this is the theme of
Kundalini Yoga these breath of fires
take place every class almost every move
that we do great I'm gonna be the first
person to pass out in a yoga class and
potentially die the possibilities are
endless then we move on to a move called
fish in a pan which is exactly what it
sounds like you lay on your stomach let
your whole body relax and then literally
spaz your arms and legs for five minutes
this was entertaining for you know 30
seconds tops
but five minutes of being a fish
in a pan the first couple weeks I tried
to be the best fish in a pan I could be
I flopped and flopped but sometimes you
want to be the fisherman and not the
dying fish might have been a
little too metaphorical to make sense in
my head right after fish in a pan no
break to regain your sanity or anything
we go in - roaring seal again exactly
what it sounds like you might be
thinking those two adjectives don't go
together and you are right what is the
roaring seal and how is this beneficial
to my health in my spiritual mind so
just imagine here's 40 college kids in
this matted room on their stomachs in
seal stretch and in order to have the
vibrations hit the right part of the
spiritual mind you have to stick out
your tongue well your roaring I'm just
gonna give you a second to visualize
this so after we do all of our moves we
roar we flop we do lots of intriguing
stuff then we sing the sunshine song now
the lyrics are something that you would
hear in a kindergarten classroom that it
sounds like we are a kindergarten yoga
cult I will play you a clip of the
sunshine song right now it's almost so
catchy that it's creepy find myself
walking home from yoga in the dark
singing the sunshine song in my
head oh this week this is the point in
my yoga career where I said you
yoga I don't like you I don't want to
take cold showers nor do I want to flop
in a pan like a fish or roar like a seal
as appealing as those three things sound
this is where I put my foot down which
clearly hasn't worked out too well
because I'm still enrolled in yoga for
five more weeks one freaking credit
that's my yoga story from hell
luckily my yoga teacher is currently on
a spiritual awakening journey in India
