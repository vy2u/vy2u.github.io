night was the Miss USA pageant
competition if you didn't know that
then congratulations you save two hours
of your life I only knew about it
because of Twitter so Thank You Twitter
on that one I never usually watch these
kinds of things but I was like you know
what I need a good laugh so my roommates
and I decided to sit down on the couch
and watch this so there was like
30-something finalists I don't know it's
hard to tell when everyone looks the
same and then there was a panel of
judges let's start off with those gems
so among these judges were two very
qualified people first being Joe Jonas
in the second being Rob Kardashian I'm
sorry what judging experience do they
have I'm pretty damn sure they're not
thinking with their mind in what they
got paid thousands of dollars to sit
there and read a question that they
didn't even come up with and
sterile girls in bikinis sounds like a
rough night now for the girls I was
rooting for Georgia the whole time
because besides the fact that she was
drop-dead gorgeous and didn't look like
a cookie cutter Barbie she could
actually talk what a concept and she
played xbox so she just won the hearts
of every single guy watching and she
knew who the Vice President of the
United States was that's always a plus
when they ask them five out of the
eleven girls you didn't know who the
vice president of our country is that
 boggles the out of my mind
last time I checked you're not running
for Miss Europe or miss Africa
you're running for Miss USA as in
America you should probably know who the
vice president of America is and then
there was Miss Ohio girl I don't even
know what this dress was if you
didn't watch it pause this video and go
Google a one of the show hosts
complimented her on it because it was
that awkward moment when everyone's like
what in the hell and this was her
response thank you I really like it it
reminds me of a big yellow school bus if
your dress reminds you of a big yellow
school bus you shouldn't be wearing that
 so throughout this whole thing got
this thing going where they tell you to
tweet a question to hashtag ask
USA and your question might be asked in
the final round of questions though on
commercials I was on Twitter scrolling
through all the questions when I found
this one and I quote in light of recent
events how concerned should Americans be
about cannibalism and what would you do
about it as Miss USA Jennifer and yeah I
favorited that you imagine their
responses to that question oh the
possibilities it got over 50 retweets
but of course the producer didn't choose
that question which is probably a good
thing I would have actually died out of
laughter but I mean it's a legit concern
right he got cannibals all the over
the place now not to point fingers but
Florida seriously though that was
something like straight the hell out of
Dexter so this whole event was sponsored
by Donald Trump who may I point out
looked pissed off the whole frickin time
like I don't know what's to be pissed
off about dude you've got more money
than people on this earth and you're
sitting front row in front of 30 banging
bodies personalities questionable and
then they played a music video which the
contestants and Donald Trump partook in
I will play you a clip right now
Donald what the hell was that
you couldn't have looked a little more
enthused about carly rae jepsen for
america it's a classic just because you
have enough money for every freaking
person on the planet doesn't mean that
you're exempt from smiling or having
real hair thumbs up if you like this
i'll see you guys in my next bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
