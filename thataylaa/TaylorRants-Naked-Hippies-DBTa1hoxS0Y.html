hippies naked one specifically and my
experience is with him this past weekend
let me just start this off by saying I
like naked people I think it's great
that you can be so comfortable in your
skin that you don't care who sees it or
how much they see but with that said the
things that occurred on this trip were
beyond my comprehension of nakedness but
to do this story justice I feel like I
should tell you the background we're
driving my little Mazda up this fucking
mountain into nowhere land and run out
of gas
we're trying to find a gas station end
up going on this dirt road with potholes
the size of fucking Texas and going
off-roading in my Mazda we finally get
to the end of the road and by end of the
road I don't mean gas station I mean the
road was closed and it was literally the
end of the road
fantastic look so nevertheless we
decided to go to the hot springs because
that was the whole point of the trip and
then worry about practical things like
how to get down the fucking mountain
later so we start hiking to the spot
where the hot springs are and let me
just point out that you have to pay 30
freakin dollars to get in what the fuck
are you doing with $30 a car making
clothing-optional signs so anyways I'm
walking in front you know leading the
Wolfpack and we get to the hot springs
which I'm gonna show you a picture of
right now so you can see kind of what
I'm talking about
keep in mind there's obviously no naked
people in that picture so it looked
totally fucking different and my legs
literally stopped moving I'm evaluating
the situation and by evaluating I mean
thinking what the fuck is wrong with
these people because the first thing I
see is this naked ass family all laying
on top of each other there's like the
mom dad and grandma in the back and then
the two kids on top of them and then the
youngest kid on top of those two kids
like a fucking naked hippie pyramid or
some shit what the fucking hell so at
this point everyone's looking at us like
we're the weird ones because you know we
have our swimsuits on like civilized
human beings what a concept get into the
upper pool first because it's the
biggest so you have the most space to
distance yourself from unwanted body
parts and there's this seven year old
guy with dreads down his ass like
literally I saw it and he's freaking
sprawled out with his leg out of the
water over a rock it would be one thing
if he was just making himself at home
getting comfortable in wresting with his
leg up or some shit but no he was
fucking staring at us the whole time I
don't know if you knew this but just
because we're in the woods doesn't mean
the cultural rules of privacy and you're
in my bubble don't apply in fact they
apply more because you're naked so
you're already in my bubble so we moved
down a pool but we're the only ones and
I'm pretty sure us in our fucking
swimsuits clean that shit because no one
came for the rest of the time we're in
there halle-fucking-lujah oh we're
sitting there minding our own business
when this woman comes walking over and
just a warning you're about to hear the
word vagina so ladies calm the fuck down
we all have one so this freakin lady who
is sagging in places that you should
never sag ever decide to do a toe
stretch or some shit and bend down right
when I look up so I'm naked hippie
vagina there's the first time for
everything and that was something that I
never wanted to have a first time for
like seriously lady fine if you want to
wear your birthday suit but don't
fucking bend over
your birthday suit birthday suits were
not meant to be bent over in there was a
lot more weird-ass shit that happened
not that hot springs it's honestly too
much to put on the Internet so we start
walking back and guess who we fucking
pass on the trail naked hippie water
pyramid people and this is what they're
doing the mom and dad are standing right
in the middle of the trail
meditating or some shit giving each
other like massages like this wasn't any
scenic view pool this was next to a
freaking log on the trail does this look
like a meditation zone to you no it's a
trail where people walk on if you're so
into the environment in the forest go
fucking stand in the forest that's what
is there for don't stand on the trail we
eventually get back to the car and we're
like okay shit now we actually have to
you know figure out how we're getting
down from this mountain alive but don't
worry we had McDonald's for lunch so we
had enough fucking carbs to last for a
month so we're sitting in the car
figuring out what to do when hippy
pyramid water family comes finding their
mode of transportation and this is the
best part no they don't drive a hybrid
or hot air balloon or horse or some shit
they drive a fucking big-ass Chrysler
are you kidding me this is the thing
that drives me insane about hippies be
one with the earth or whatever you go be
a hippie you put on your Patrol the oil
you protest you go eat your fucking tofu
but don't be a hypocrite and drive a
gas-guzzling chrysler in the process all
I'm saying
so we made it to a gas station thank God
