100% raw unprepared just me talking to
you guys I don't know when this video
will be up but when I'm recording it
right now
this past week I can't tell you how many
videos I've seen about so many of the
big guru youtuber people have been
complaining about the hate they're
getting and the comments are getting
just been this like big YouTube cry fest
I am lucky enough where I'm at the point
where I have people that watch my videos
I don't have a like crazy amount of
subscribers where I'm getting like tons
of hate and things like that and I hope
that never happens but I know it will
eventually if I get to that point the
Sun just decided to show up seriously
alright we're just gonna have to deal
with the Sun children right there where
I am right now
YouTube has been probably the best
decision I've made in a long time so I'm
speaking from where I am right now I
can't say that that wouldn't affect me
because I haven't been there yet this
isn't going to be like a YouTube advice
video I'm just telling you my thoughts
you can't be on YouTube and have thin
skin it's not possible if you're gonna
listen to the asshole sitting behind a
computer anonymously talking shit about
you it's like it's ridiculous the
difference between YouTube and real life
is that people are still talking shit in
real life you just can see them so
they're not gonna say it to your face
for me YouTube is a hobby it's fun I
love filming videos I love telling you
guys about new things I love making
laughs is something that I do as a hobby
and I can justify that i'ma make about
it because I now have someone to share
it with and talk to you guys about it
with YouTube is fun for me
I get emails and messages all the time
with girls asking me how did you get
subscribers so fast how did you get
started blah blah what's your advice I
think I'm gonna make a whole other video
about like YouTube advice but just
fucking be yourself you are not gonna
have fun nor is anyone else gonna have
fun washing your videos if you are not
yourself it's see-through you're not
gonna want to show it to your friends
and family and you're not gonna feel
like you're being yourself and you're
not gonna be true to yourself I'm
speaking from experience
because if you've been watching me since
the very beginning which probably none
of you are because I was totally
different because I wasn't being myself
I did not cuss I felt like I had to be
one of these @youtube girls and then I
got over it I was like you know what at
the end of the day I don't want to be
remembered for being pretty or being
whatever like that's not that doesn't
like make me feel happy I want to be
remembered for making people laugh or I
don't know making some kind of
impression on them other than looks and
so eventually I was like you know what
people are either gonna like me or hate
me and I don't give a shit so I made my
first video that I was like totally
myself was the 19 random facts tag which
you can watch down below oh good
lighting and I was just like I don't
care I'm gonna be myself see what
happens
I'm probably gonna get negative feedback
and dislikes whatever and that was that
like you can't have a thin skin on
YouTube those two things don't go
together I had a friend in real life who
wanted to make a youtube channel and she
was getting all like upset about like
what if people don't like my videos what
they hit the dislike button and I told
her
people are gonna hit the dislike button
like that shit happens who fucking cares
like really who cares
people in life in real life don't like
you so why is it different on the
computer people on YouTube have the
balls to expose themselves and the
personality their flaws whatever on the
internet I'm mainly making this video to
let you guys know that I or anyone else
on the Internet is not perfect even
these big gurus who get all dolled up
every time they film a video don't film
when they have zits don't do this don't
do this because the public and their
viewers aren't gonna like it they're not
perfect in real life so when you leave
rude comments on people's videos or
comments commenting on their flaws what
does that do
does that really make you feel better
about yourself and if it does you should
probably reevaluate your life and I
don't know in my advice
for you if you are thinking about
starting a YouTube channel is do it and
don't give a shit about what people
think this might just be me that I'm
that much of a blunt bitch that I don't
care but it honestly does not affect me
when someone hits the dislike button
like great you dislike my video don't
wash it I don't care there's gonna be
more people hopefully who liked it then
dislike it and I'm making it for those
people not for you who's gonna hit the
dislike button I don't even know what
this video is but I just want you guys
to know that I feel like in order to be
successful it is on my chest like sticky
in order to have fun on YouTube and not
let it affect your life which it does
for a lot of people you need to go in
with a positive attitude be yourself and
accept the fact that people aren't gonna
like you for that if you don't fit into
the cookie cutter Barbie YouTube guru
whatever fine
like there's way too many of those
already I guarantee you you're going to
be more successful if you open up let
your flaws show be vulnerable because
that's the stuff that people can relate
to I consider you guys my friends my
YouTube family my YouTube community and
I hope that it can stay that way for as
long as I'm on YouTube because it really
is fun for me and a hobby for me the
other thing I wanted to quickly mention
is it boggles the shit out of my mind
and don't get me wrong I'm flattered but
when people on Instagram or Twitter or
whatever will comment back and be like
oh my god like the Tayla just replied to
me blah blah like made my night I am
like that amazes me honestly like that
like thank you but then again I'm like I
I don't know I I guess it's different
for me because I know myself this is
going nowhere I just a person sitting in
an empty room by myself making videos on
the internet for you guys yeah if you
tweet me I'm gonna respond or I'm gonna
retweet you or I'm gonna favorite it if
I like it I'm a
person I'm not any different than any of
you out there and while I'm extremely
flattered that some of you guys say that
I also want you to know that I am here
for you guys whether it's makeup
questions relationship questions
something going on in your life message
me or email me or tweet me and I will
talk to you because I'm a person and I
care about you guys you guys support me
and I want to support you it's probably
like the most emotional video I've made
so far and I hope you guys liked it I
hope it gives you kind of a different
perspective on YouTube and how I feel
about it
I love making videos and never get a
good comment it honestly makes my day
and I appreciate you guys and I feel
like I haven't said that ever but I do
and thank you that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
