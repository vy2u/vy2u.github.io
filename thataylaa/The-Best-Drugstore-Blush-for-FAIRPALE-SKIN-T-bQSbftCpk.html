to look like I was just outside freezing
my ass off look this is perfect
alright so today we are going to be
talking about my top drugstore blushes
just randomly thought that I should do
this video because I never talked about
my favorite blushes in general and there
are some really great affordable ones
from the drugstore if you want to know
my other favorite drugstore makeup I
have two drugstore makeup starter kit
videos one from a couple years ago and
one from this past year so I will link
both those down below or you can click
the little eye and it will pop up if
you're on mobile it's in that corner
probably I just filmed a video on this
look so I'll also link that down below
if you want to know how to get the look
that I'm wearing right now use the shine
XO palette and I am freaking in love
this this thing killing me
right so let's just let's get into it
I'm gonna start with the one that I'm
currently most obsessed with and that's
the covergirl trublend blush this is in
the shade oh here we go
medium Rose 200 I gravitate towards more
pinky shades as you'll see here but the
formula of this though finish everything
is just so nice I haven't been a fan of
cover girls blushes in the past because
they are pretty chalky and they smell
just like really cheap but this is such
a nice blush blends out really nicely
has a little bit of a sheen to it I've
mentioned this in raids and rejects
video I've been wearing this pretty much
every single day
alright memory card just got full but we
are back I'm about to murder my
neighbor's dog hope you guys can't hear
him what were we talking about the next
favorite blush is definitely the elf
blushes these are ridiculously
affordable they're only three dollars
this is the shade peachy keen which I've
clearly hit pan on this is such a pretty
color especially if you have a little
bit of a tan going on when I used to
self tan this would look amazing on my
face it still looks really nice but
there's something about it when you have
a tan going on that it just looks
incredible
these blushes are really great quality
for the price I love them I have like
four different shades of them this is
just my most used one this tree
definitely has a bit of a sheen to it
if I can get it out doesn't even do a
justice on my hand but you can see it
has quite a bit more Sheen to it than
the covergirl blush this is probably the
blush I've used for the longest from the
drugstore that never fails me if you're
looking for a good peachy blush but you
have fair skin sometimes it's really
hard to find a nice peach blush that
doesn't look sure
orange on your face this is the L'Oreal
True Match blush in the shade neutral
and this is like a tiny version actually
found this at Dollar Tree like years ago
I should probably get a new ones
probably definitely expired this one has
lasted me forever and I still haven't
hit pan on this and there was a phase
where I was using this every single day
oh it's actually not in the shade
neutral is administrated innocent flush
and these are so nice so soft holy crap
and look at that shade it's just
beautiful blends out really easily super
soft really nice quality and that's what
the shade looks like so it definitely
has more peach tones in it than any of
the other swatches so far I highly
recommend these blushes if you haven't
tried them out go for it the full-size
ones actually come in like a huge pan so
for what you're paying you get a ton of
blush anything I mentioning this from
the drugstore wait until the brand goes
on sale dress or switch out their brand
so every few weeks different brand will
be like 40% off so wait till goes on
sale and then snatch these up I'm gonna
clear out this watching and another one
that I've used for years now this is
like a four in one product basically
this is the one of my holy grail
drugstore products this is the
Physicians Formula shimmer brick in the
shade warm nude I'm pretty sure if
you're looking for that straight-up glow
this is beautiful you basically use
these on your face or your eyes there's
so many different uses for these you
could use just the pink tones as a blush
you could use this as a highlight
bronzer if you want like a super glowy
look you could blend all three together
and get like a super pretty glowy cheek
but if you're not someone who likes a
full-on glow on your cheek you just want
like a little pink illumination going on
you could just go in with the pink
shades and like top off your blush with
it but totally up to you I've done a few
different looks using this super pretty
on your eyes as just eyeshadow
definitely recommend this product is by
Physicians Formula if I didn't say that
this is janky looking but clearly used
because I lost the top and this is the
makeup revolution brand and this is in
the shade now exclamation point if
you're looking for that winter want to
look like I was just outside freezing my
ass off look this is perfect this is
like a couple dollars a cup revolution
is now carried out Ulta so before they
were only online if you're in the u.s.
now
find them out alta i use a stippling
brush with this because it is pretty
pigmented not as soft as some of the
other blushes i've mentioned but the
shade and the pigmentation look at that
similar shade and i'm actually
interested to swatch these next to each
other is the Maybelline master contour
kit I have a whole full review on this
product it comes with the bronzer or
contour shade blush and a highlight the
highlight is really pretty not as
intense as the Physicians Formula one
but it is super pretty the blush shade
though is what I reach for most often
super soft I'm going to swatch this next
to the shade because yeah these look
really similar the maybelline one is
slightly lighter and a little bit less
pigmented like I'm having to layer it on
to get the same kind of color payoff
again a nice rosy pink shade so to get
out of the Pink's for a second a little
bit different shade this is the Milani
romantic rose powder blush in the shade
0-1 romantic rose these blushes are
really nice and at first I wasn't
feeling it because they're a little bit
when you swatch it feel like they're
going to be a little bit stiff but the
color comes off like the color payoff is
there and this is a nice neutral more
neutral pink shade it's not super peachy
and it's not super pink dustier tone
there it is right there this is nice if
you have a lot going on your eyes and
you just want something that's going to
give you color to your face but it's not
super intense lolani has a ton of
different shades in the Rose blushes
this is just my favorite next is another
makeup revolution product and this is
their sugar and spice ultra blush
palette this is like under $12 and you
get eight different shades okay how am I
not blending you there we go
you have a ton of different variety in
here which is what I really like about
this you could just get this and be like
good to go you have some more neutral
shades you have a super warm reddish
tone blush peach pinks and then you have
these illuminating shades which are
really pretty to just blend all over on
your cheeks on top of some of the other
shades when I use this I usually just
like swirl my brush and go in with a mix
of all these shades and it turns out
really nice I'm going to swatch them the
illuminating shades just so you can see
these are more of like blushes if you
want that glowy look or just blush
toppers out where that just swatch okay
right there there you go so it gives a
really nice
like we're going through this really
fast the last part I want to mention is
by colour-pop and these are their super
shock cheeks you can't find these in the
drugstore but they're drugstore prices
actually cheaper than a lot of the
products I mentioned they still wanted
to throw this in if you're not familiar
with color pop they make amazing quality
products for like five dollars pretty
much all their products are five dollars
this is in the shade between the sheets
which is beautiful and the consistency
of these is really interesting it's like
a cream to powder kind of situation I
don't like putting this on top of
powders because I feel like I do get
that weird like consistency that you get
when you put a cream product on top of
powder so if I'm going to be using this
I like to just apply it with my finger
on top of liquid foundation before I put
a setting powder on I'm like running out
of space this is a really nice warm
peachy shade right there there you have
it is just the one I've grabbed to show
you guys but there are some beautiful
blush shades by them they have some
really unique shades too like if you're
looking for a blush shade that isn't
super common like a more purpley blush
or a darker blush if you have a dark
skin tone then you should check out
color pop so those are all of my
favorite drugstore blushes let me know
what your guys's favorites are down
below I'm starving I'm going to go eat
breakfast it's now 12:40 in the
