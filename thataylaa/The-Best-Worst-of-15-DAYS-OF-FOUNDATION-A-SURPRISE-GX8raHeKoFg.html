wrap-up video for 15 days of foundation
if you're new here it is stumbled across
this video that there's a series called
15 days of foundation where every single
day for 15 days I tried out a new
foundation I'm willing the playlist down
below so you can go through and watch
all 15 dates of first impressions if you
missed any this video is just going to
be kind of a wrap-up of the series and
be ranking them 1 to 15 so you can see
it my favorites and my least favorites
I'm not going to go super in-depth about
each product because I did a full review
on each one I also have a little
surprise for you guys so let's get the
surprise out of the way then I'm going
to jump into ranking all the foundations
so I did this series just for fun
because I love foundation finding a good
foundation for your skin is one of the
hardest things to find I feel like
making first impression videos are some
of my favorite videos to film doing 15
first impressions normally would have
taken me probably four months to do I
know a lot of you guys follow me for my
foundation reviews if you have similar
skin to me or if you're pale or if you
have acne before I started YouTube
finding good foundation videos for
people that actually didn't have perfect
skin and the had pale skin was really
hard for me so I hope that this series
was super helpful for you guys I just
want to say a huge thank you again for
all of your support all of your feedback
throughout this whole series I was
honestly blown away I said I just kind
of did it for fun I thought it would be
a cool thing to try and do and like
challenge myself I'm so grateful for all
of you who took the time to leave a
positive comment doing 15 days of videos
filming editing uploading well you have
another job is freaking hard the last
five days of this we're definitely
pretty challenging for me and your
guys's snaps and tweets and everything
are what really kept me going so I just
want to say a huge thank you to all of
you to take the time to comment and
tweet me or whatever so surprise time
after getting tons of snaps from you
guys after the series ended of people
like going through 15 days of foundation
depression and I also was like really
missing filming foundation videos
decided to continue 15 days foundation
in some capacity I talked about this a
lot on snapchat I basically asked you
guys if you had any ideas how we could
continue this I have never seen so many
snaps coming in at one time ever so
thank you guys for all the feedback so
after going through all of your feedback
I think I figured something out it's not
realistic for me to do 15 days of
foundation every month at all and I
still want to put other content out on
my channel I really like the idea of 15
years of foundation I like putting it up
at the same time every single day I
don't want to kill the excitement for
doing it too often and I also don't want
to kill myself for doing it too often so
I think what I'm going to do is do it
every three months so I'm going to like
make an image with the 15 days of
foundation calendar and I'll probably
tweet it and share it on Instagram or
something just so you guys can see what
months it'll be taking place but I think
I'm still going to do the 15th or 20th
of those months so the next 15 days
foundation will be in October in
addition to that since I love putting
out foundation videos and if there's
like a new foundation coming up that I
want to talk about I'm going to be doing
foundation Friday
and tons of you guys suggested this on
snapchat that way you guys will know
every Friday there will be a foundation
first impression the first foundation
Friday will not be this week it'll be
the next week because I already have a
ton of pre-recorded videos right now to
go up so be on the lookout next week
Friday make sure you let me know down
below what foundation you want to see it
for the first ever foundation Friday on
my channel so I really hope you guys are
excited about foundation Friday and 15
days of foundation give this video a
thumbs up if you are and if you enjoyed
the first series let's jump in to
ranking the foundations so I have them
all ranked here laid out in my planner
so since finishing the series I've been
testing out different combinations of
these and just wearing a few of them
again with different powders and primers
and stuff just to get a full idea of my
thoughts on them so I obviously wasn't
able to test out all 15 again I just
picked some of the ones that I was like
most excited about or that almost works
for me but not quite Before we jump into
foundation I want to show you
Radia powders that I pretty much set my
face with every single day
my two holy grail setting powders are
the cosmetic celebration foundation
elimination and the shade fair I'm like
majorly in need of a new one of these
this is my go-to when I want a powder
that doesn't take away the finish of the
foundation too much like it keeps the
doing this I'm wearing it today's have a
little bit of coverage you could use
this on its own if you don't need a ton
of coverage my other holy grail is the
cover effects illuminating setting
powder so this is a loose powder I
typically don't gravitate towards loose
powders that this one rocks is one of
the only loose powders that I feel like
actually gives me coverage instead of
like weirdly wiping away my foundation
or concealer whatever this has a
beautiful finish I would say is gives
you adds Chloe will finish as a
cosmetics powder but it does still have
this like skin like super soft effect to
it your fair skinned the shade of this
is beautiful this one I feel like just
looks amazing with any foundation that I
try it with so recently in the past like
5 days when I've been testing these out
I've been using the maybelline superstay
better skin powder in the shade 10
porcelain and oh it's real Isis has
salicylic acid this is a beautiful
powder really does make your face look
like skin still it just walled some
powder it's a very satin skin like
finish and what I like about this is
that I feel like the finish of the
foundation can still shine through a
little bit a shade of this actually
works for me it's a tad dark but it can
work so I have been using that with some
of the foundations that I'm going to
mention so these are my three current
favorite powders I recommend any of
these or it's going to be a hella long
video so let's get into ranking the
foundations so if you watched all 50
days of foundation you could probably
guess what my top slash maybe top two
are so before we get into ranking all
these I did do swatches so you can see
shade comparisons these are not in any
particular order my arm acts great thank
you thank you our blog for coming to the
party so right here is the Catrice
foundation this is the josie maran argan
oil this is the oldest equation this is
the hourglass stick foundation in
alabaster and this is the hourglass
stick foundation in Blanc this is the LC
foundation this
is Urban Decay Naked skin this is why I
sell to Shikata Jacob beauty's skin
sealer where you going dermablend cover
cream cover FX CLIC stic Tarte
rainforest of the sea soap &amp;amp; Glory one
heck of a blot golden rose stick
foundation Estee Lauder Double Wear
cushion
stick foundation that is a mystic
foundation and the makeup rubber water
blend foundation so here are all the
foundations washed I have foundation
like up to my armpit right now keep in
mind while I'm ranking this this is what
works for me and what I look for in a
foundation you might absolutely love one
of the foundations that I hate and vice
versa so like I always say do your own
research watch other videos and other
skin types and form your own opinions
because this is just what works for me
hands down clear foundation I tried
during the series with a tart rain force
of the sea water foundation have won
this a few more times since filming that
video seriously it was like powder
blowing around this is a foundation that
I feel like is stunning and I think this
will work for multiple different kinds
of skin types and it is a water-based
kind of serum like foundation I can see
this working for dry skin I have
combination oily skin with cystic acne I
like high coverage foundation this I
definitely need to use a lot of to get
it to the kind of coverage I like but it
is buildable I can get it pretty dang
fool coverage but to me it's worth it
because the finish is so beautiful makes
your face look super plump
super long-lasting looks incredible by
the end of the night I just like
literally want to give this foundation
at hug though number two is the Urban
Decay Naked skin
weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup choosing between these two was
like kind of like picking a favorite
child
this one just pulled ahead a tiny bit
this was kind of the same situation get
the kind of coverage I like I use quite
a bit of this but it is super buildable
it still looks like skin which is what I
love I'm wearing it today with a
cosmetics powder
do you think I like it a little bit
better with the cover effects powder I
mean I think it looks great right now
with this powder too but holy this
powder with this foundation lasts for
ever so far out of what I've tried I
think this is the best like oil
controlling combination this found
with this powder literally made my
makeup look flawless the entire day find
me out for like a long time you need my
makeup to really last I will definitely
be reaching for these two okay so
foundation number three and this was
also hard number three and for choosing
between them oh my god that literally
just spilled all over the carpet what
just happened
BRB alright it's all good so number
three foundation is the Josie Maran
vibrancy foundation fluid if you like a
super dewy foundation but that's long
lasting I would say go with this one
this is beautiful super glowy if you
have dry skin and I think this would be
great if you have oily skin probably not
your foundation number four is the
golden rose stick foundation this was
like a seven dollar six dollar
foundation off of Amazon this ranked
higher than a ton of high-end foundation
so just goes to show you that drugstore
or high-end I think there are good
products and bad products really like
saying like for drugstore foundation is
good because I just think this is a good
product regardless I think this one will
work well for normal skin if you have
oily ur skin this one might break down
but I think this is really going to come
down to what powder you use to set this
I love the shade of this on me it is
pretty pale blends out easier than one
of the high-end stick foundations I've
tried really quick to apply and I just
think this one rock so those top four
are basically the ones that I was like
pretty wowed by I would say that any of
those four are worth giving a go the
next three are ones that I think were
good but I wouldn't say I was like super
super impressed but so number five is
the YSL Touche claw foundation I think
just for being so expensive I'm not sure
if this is worth the money to me it
reminds me a little bit of the josie
maran argan oil foundation I would say
this one is a little bit due year I like
the shade of this one better for me I
think you would kind of go with
either/or for this and I would
personally go with this one so number
six is the ultra color correcting
foundation and primer stick the only
reason why I rank this one below the YSL
was because I feel like this is like a
very
specific use for me this isn't a
long-lasting product if you're someone
like me where I like to our makeup to
the beach I like to wear makeup when I
go on a run like foundation not a
full-on face just to cover up my acne
and my scarring this is one of those
products where I don't feel like I'm
wasting a ton of money by using it for
that purpose
I can literally apply to my whole face
in about 20 seconds it's just super
quick to blend out shade wise I liked it
when I went on and run the other day I
use this product with the maybelline
superstay powder and that combo looked
like skin didn't look like I was wearing
like a cake face of makeup to go running
so I feel like this one I wouldn't say
buy this for like an everyday long
lasting foundation say buy this if you
want something to use for those kind of
situations number seven is the first
like matte matte foundations the Catrice
all matte plus shine control makeup and
this is too dark for me so if you are
pale princess this one will probably be
too dark for you however I mix this in
with the Josie Maran vibrancy and these
two together were beautiful mixing these
two together formula wise and shade wise
worked this one does last pretty well if
you're super oily and you're not super
pale you might like this one so the next
five are ones that I think aren't bad
products they're just ones that
personally didn't quite work for me I'm
not sure if I'm going to be reaching for
these ones too often some of these I
think would be good mixing products but
I pretty much wouldn't reach for any of
these to wear again totally on their own
so number eight is the Jake a beauty HD
skin sealer foundation this is super
affordable if this was light enough for
me I think that I would like this
someone's like one of those products I
feel like is to do a two set without
like weird texture stuff happening it
feels very much like a gel foundation it
says it's supposed to be high coverage I
did not get good coverage with this I
would say this is something that if you
have extremely dry skin you are not
super pale because this is too dark and
you want something that has like medium
coverage then you might like this I am
going to play around with this one I
would never reach for this to wear on
its own
again number nine for me is the cover
effects clip cream foundation looking at
how this blended out is what ranked this
kind of low I do think that this wore
well and this is super pale golden rose
stick foundation blends out way easier
than that if you definitely need to use
some kind of smoothing primer to give
yourself a super soft canvas to blend
this out on top of or else you're just
going to have a rough time blending this
product out it's just kind of mediocre
like I think there are way better stick
foundations that you could spend your
money on okay so number ten and this one
ranked this low for a variety of
different reasons so the number one
thing to me is just I just think this
product is a huge ripoff I broke down
like the price and how much product you
get and all that kind of stuff in this
review video this is just extremely
expensive for the amount of project
you're getting and I want to restate
because it seems like some people were a
little bit confused this really isn't a
stick foundation the name stick is in
the name but it is a liquid foundation
packaged in a stick like packaging with
a cushion top yes it makes sense that
stick foundations you get less product
than normal because they're usually more
densely pigmented typically you should
have to use a little bit less than the
liquid foundation which makes sense this
foundation is just packaged in the stick
I feel like honestly so they could give
less product and charge more that just
like really irks me I don't like that if
you can get over spending like double
for liquid foundation I do think the
product is nice if you like doing medium
coverage just doesn't have high coverage
when you build this up you can get it to
a medium coverage the color for me is a
little bit off I feel like it's not
quite light enough I don't think it's
worth this much money to like mix in
with other product 9 10 11 I'm literally
having to count every single time the
number 11 is the LC micro silk
foundation this is one of those products
I think is totally fine it's just not
for me again it's the same kind of
situation for the price of it I just
don't think it's worth really mixing in
with other foundations for me I don't
know even if you're someone who likes
light coverage I would still say go with
the target the urban decay
you can definitely wear those more
sheared since I use a ton of product and
build it up to get a helpful coverage I
like it personally I think that one's a
tad overhyped so number 12 is the makeup
over water blend foundation this is
extremely extremely sheer this is
definitely the most sheer foundation
that I own in that I have ever put on my
face if it wasn't for this series I
definitely wouldn't be been tried to
make this one work with three layers I
got it about a high light coverage which
I think says a lot about how sheer this
product really is the other thing that
really threw me off about this is that
it did cling to my dry patches and for
being a water blend foundation I just
think that is so bizarre if you have
freckles and you're literally looking to
like even out a tiny bit of your redness
where you don't want it to cover your
freckles at all you might like this
personally would never use this again
probably would not even mix this in with
other stuff just because kind of like
mixing in water alright on to the final
three foundations which was kind of like
ranking my favorite piece of trash
honestly ranking these three are like
kind of a joke it's literally like
saying which shitty chore do you like
the best you know I'm saying so the best
worst foundation is the dermablend cover
creme the formula of this which is like
total bust for me applying this just
takes forever I just really couldn't
think of one benefit of this besides the
fact that it is super light but even
then they're just as light foundation so
to have way better formulas which by the
way I have a extremely pale foundation
video coming like foundations that are
too light for me so that will be coming
alright have it filmed edited ready to
go wouldn't recommend this at all I am
so confused by some of the reviews I'm
seeing coming out about this product
this is the hourglass vanish thick
foundation I'm just kind of like
honestly mind blown so I tried wearing
this again in the five days when I was
like trying out different foundations I
was like okay I'm going to use a
different setting powder let's make this
work I kind of have hope kind of not the
like let's try it out so I play this
again set it with the Maybelline I feel
like I'm losing my
boys right now applied it with the main
bullying and better skin powder pretty
much every day when I was trying out
these foundations I was updating you
guys on snapchat so you can see how they
looked I literally had to take this off
my face by about 1:00 p.m. because it
looked so horrible it was breaking down
on my forehead it was breaking down
around my nose it looked horrible you
have made this work for you tell me how
what powder and primer are using number
15 is the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a
blot liquid to powder foundation I have
like no words if you want to be
entertained you should definitely go
back and watch this video because I
really don't think I've ever worn a
foundation that right off the bat looks
this bad it says this full coverage this
isn't full coverage off of one layer on
the first layer it still looked bad it
was patchy I had such a Foundation
mustache going on like the most texture
in weird I've ever seen going on on
my face I love some of soap employs
other products this one just really was
a Miss alright so that was all 15
foundations ranked I hope that you guys
