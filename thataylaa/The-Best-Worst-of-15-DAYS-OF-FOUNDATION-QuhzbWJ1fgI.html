alright so today we're doing the wrap-up
video for 15 days of foundation this is
where I'm going to be ranking all the
foundations all 15 1 through 15 best to
worst if you're just landing here or
you're confused about life's 50 music
foundation is where I do a new first
impression video on the foundation every
single day for 15 days I've done at two
of the series now I'm like both of the
playlist down below so you can go watch
the individual foundation reviews if you
want to but this video is where I'm
going to be kind of giving you my
overall thoughts I've tried all of these
again if you're wondering how I did that
in a week and a half
I've been trying out the foundations in
between actual filming so I have been
trying these for more than week and a
half in between so basically I just
played around with all the foundations
that mix some of them tried them with
different powders primers all that good
stuff so every product I'm going to be
talking about is linked down below in
the description box along with each
corresponding video if you want to go
check it out before we jump into it I
wanted to say a quick thank you for all
of your support you guys Rock during I
mean you rock all the time but you
especially roster in 50 days foundation

of your snaps and tweets and support and
everything just really fun for me and
for those of you who are new I am
continuing 15 is the foundation I do it

between that foundation Friday is a
permanent thing some people are confused
about that foundation Friday is here to

you as well who have done that project
we share is blown away by all of your
grades and support so it means a lot
them and it means a lot to me all right
that was a long intro let's do this so
basically what I did was I tried out all
of these again like I said in different
ways I actually wrote notes this time
around so I have all of my notes here I
wrote down how they wore what setting
powder used all the details so I'm just
going to go through we're going to start
best to work because I'm why not I did
do this video for the last series as
well just want to know my best and works
from the other series cereal so just new
cereal if you want to know my best and
worst format theories that video will be
down below and a little eyes right now
number one you could probably guess or I
know this was kind of tough these the
top two I really like both of these the
reason why this one pulled a little bit
more ahead is because the shade is
perfection for me I love the shade I
love pretty much everything about this
product this is the derma call makeup
cover foundation in the shade 2:08 the
lightest shade number wise is 2:07 but
the actual lightest shade is 2:08 now
that I've played around with this more I
love mixing this in with products I love
wearing it by itself it looks pretty
much flawless with any powder setting
spray anything that I've used this is
stunning
it's under 20 bucks Amazon keeps jacking
up the price because you guys are buying
it it is still under 20 bucks hopefully
it'll stay under 20 bucks on Amazon you
need the tiniest bit of this you get
completely full coverage it looks like
skin which is the most amazing thing
about this the finish of it and
everything
I actually had people both times the one
foundation I had compliments on my skin
which rarely happens it's literally one
of those products that just makes you
look like you have flawless naturally
good skin but you're getting insane
coverage a bunch of you guys have
snatched me that you got this and that
you love in it as well so I always want
to know what you think of products after
you try them for my recommendations if
you like and more didn't like them
products works differently for different
people which is something I always say
even if I love something you might hate
it in vice versa so keep that in mind
with the products and talking about
these are products that works for me or
didn't work for me you could and will
probably have totally different
experiences with some of the products
I'm going to mention so just do your own
research you can always return products
try them out if you don't want them
return them but anyways back to the
foundation so it makes this thing with a
few different products my favorite
combination with this was actually with
the covergirl clean matte BB cream which
is one of my favorite foundations at the
moment it's not a BB cream it's a
frickin foundation I don't know why they
called that but that one is too dark for
me so mixing this in gave me more
coverage it lightened it with that combo
said it would be a cosmetic celebration
foundation illumination imma link my
favorite powders down below as well I
wrote in capital letters right here not
only amazing but flawless all day I love
this this is like my new love so second
place was the Clinique continuous
coverage makeup this one also looks
amazing I'm wearing this right now mixed
in with the LA girl Pro coverage white
foundation this was also on the products
I will be talking about a wish
Clinique made more shades of this tape
that there's only a few shades of this
product this is way too dark for me on
its own but if you have pale skin you'll
have to make this one in with the
lighter which is obviously a downside
but the good thing is that since this
has such insane covers when you mix in a
whitener it's really not going to shared
out a whole lot you're still going to
get really good coverage I love the
finish of this looks like skin beautiful
products if this one matches your skin
I'm jealous I would wear this by itself
as would match my skin but it also works
mixing really well foundation so feeling
this one Clinique number two the number
is three four and five were kind of hard
for me to write actually the rest of
these besides the last slide the worst
five we're pretty hard for me to rank
just because these are like the
two standout products from Seoul thing
the next ones I had slight issue I would
say issues but I don't hundred percent
completely love them I really want to
completely love this one because I love
how number three looks right when you
first apply it and for the first four
hours this is the etude house big cover
concealer BB this is the perfect shade
for me I think if I have one foundation
shade that matches me to a tee is this
one absolutely love this the first four
or five hours in the review video that I
did on this you guys saw it totally
separated and broke down actually twice
because I had to film that clip the next
day and not even separated it got like
little beads almost really weird I've
never had that happen to me before at
the product but in the comments one of
you guys suggested to try it without a
primer but that is what I did I actually
have worn this like four times probably
three or four times with the primer
without a primer with different powders
because I want to make this work so bad
all that made zero difference it still
totally got beady and weird on me after
about five hours I still cut this at
number three because everyone's skin
reacts differently to different products
a bunch of you guys said that this one
it doesn't do that to you some of you
guys said that it did some of you said a
bunch of other foundations did that to
you that are totally fine on me I think
this one is worth getting a go because
you don't know what's going to happen on
your skin with it oh I realize I haven't
been saying skin types and stuff really
quick rewind used to I would say fine
for all skin types pretty much if you
have more other skin obviously sub used
with the powder this one I would say if
you have dry skin I don't think this one
would be the best this one has
definitely more mattes in the first two
so we've been talking forever about this
but it just is good at quick coverage I
can put this on in literally like 30
seconds I think it's worth giving a go
because it could be totally fine on you
and I really like this foundation I'm
going to continue to wear it I don't
have to be out for a long period of time
like if I'm just going out to dinner or
something I will definitely be using
this because I love it this is the es1
and vissa we're at liquid foundation i
ranked this number 4 because i think a
lot of people will like this product
this personally does not have enough
coverage for me at all i think this is
more on the light light to medium side
but a lot of people don't want full car
if you're someone who likes light to
medium coverage this is beautiful the
more I played around with it the more I
kind of liked it but it isn't super
long-lasting if you need something
that's going to stay on all night where
you don't have to touch it up I don't
think this is it but if you like light
to medium coverage I think this could
work for all skin types the shade of
this 1.0 which is their new shade is
beautiful if you're pale probably only
be reaching this to mix in with other
products that either want to shear out a
little bit or lighten but if you like
lighter coverage you might like this so
number five I feel like I played around
with this one the most and I am so on
the fence with this product
I just use this in my drugstore dupes
video I did half my face high and half
drugstore dupes I'll put it over here
this is the LA girl Pro coverage HD
Foundation and the white mixer the
reason I'm on the fence about this one
is that I love how it looks until it
starts breaking down and getting
ridiculously oily I haven't really found
a combo that it doesn't make me a leaf
at the end of the day find almost
exactly as the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation when it first goes on such as
why does it do puff in that video my
favorite way to apply this is only put
on one layer spot conceal and I get
pretty good coverage when I do that you
like lighter coverage you can definitely
get lighter coverage with this if you
like more medium coverage I think you
can build it up to medium coverage it
looks like skin it looks really
beautiful on the skin if you have dry
skin you'll probably love this because
it goes on beautifully and it'll
probably just make you look like you
have a little bit of do by the end of
the day if you have oily skin this one I
really don't think will hold up even
with a setting powder I still get super
oily with this there's another one for
me that I like but if I need something
that's going to last all day I probably
wouldn't reach for this number six is
the Bourjois healthy mix serum
foundation gives you the prettiest it
really is like a healthy kind of glow it
just makes you look like you have really
nice natural skin if you're pale this
one is way too dark even using a mixer
this one is pretty dark but I mix this
in with derma call and I set it with the
Maybelline better skin powder and that
combo was great at lightens this product
it looks super smooth on my skin and by
the end of the day it was dewy but it
wasn't oily I think this one could be
beautiful on more mature skin or dry
skin if you like something that
natural and looks glowy and dewy and you
don't need a whole lot of coverage I
think you will really like this one so
number seven is one that I like I don't
love it and I feel like I have to have a
certain kind of skin day to use this and
to have it look really good but this is
the hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation if you have oily skin this
thing will frickin control your oil all
day long I don't get oily at all when I
use this product which is the main
reason why I like it it holds up really
well throughout the day I switch to my
moisturizer my skin has been really
Drive the past few days and I actually
use this yesterday and if you have dry
skin I would say stay away from this one
because it did cling to certain dry
patches that I didn't notice the first
time I used it it has light coverage but
if you build it up you can get it to
medium coverage the way I apply this is
spot conceal first and then just put on
one layer this Sunday this one would
really be best for oily skin with light
coverage so number eight is Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum cover foundation I
had a hard time ranking this one I
really want to like this one but again
there's something with this product that
it just looks a little bit heavy you
like to double address on my skin it
just doesn't look quite as flawless at
all as the Clinique or the derma call
this is so dark for me that is to the
point where I pretty much can't mix it
mixes in with the LA girl white
foundation and it was barely light
enough it also was still totally matte
this white product is pretty dewy and
illuminating when mixed with this it was
completely matched people like the
double wear I personally don't but if
you like the double wear and you like
the finish of it and how it looks on
your skin but you want more coverage you
would probably love this for me it just
looked a little bit heavy even when I
mixed it I'm just not totally in love
with this I might actually be returning
this one just because I can't even
really mix it if you guys have asked
what do I do with all the foundations
that I don't like do I return them what
do I do with them and since I do a
youtube I typically keep them I have
them all in the drawer the ones I don't
like just for different videos and so I
can reference them and swatch them and
stuff so usually I don't return your
foundation just so I can have it for
other videos but if I didn't do YouTube
I would 100% return them or if it's a
place that doesn't accept
turns or you don't want to return it or
whatever you can always donate it so
number nine is with Sephora airbrush
spray foundation of course this video
has like almost 150,000 views and this
is the one where I was having like the
breakdown in it so if you found my
channel through that video that's not
usually what happens I almost wish I
just refilled that one because I just
don't like talking about that kind of
stuff but anyways on to foundation so in
the comments of this video you guys said
the best way to apply this is to spray
it directly onto a brush and then buff
it onto your skin so that is what I did
I mix this shade with the lighter shade
and when I mix the two that was like the
perfect shade for me when I used a brush
at a really difficult time layering it
it kind of just would blend away what
you just put on so I would just kind of
stipple it wait for it to set a little
bit and then do a second layer I don't
know how people get full coverage with
this I really don't one layer of this
for me was light to medium coverage on
two layers I got good coverage using the
brush but it was just kind of a pain in
the ass to apply even spraying it onto
the brush because of the way you have to
layer it but it lasted really well
throughout the day it looks smooth if
you just want to do that one layer this
one looked nice again the practicality
of this is just I don't get it
this is no way that I would use this on
a daily basis maybe for special events
or something but I know this is one of
those foundations that a lot of people
really love so again personal preference
wasn't for me might be for you so number
10 now we're getting into the ones I'm
not a fan of this is the Lancome 10 Idol
Ultra cushion foundations when I use
this for a second time my spot conceals
first I actually used a Beauty Blender
to apply it and it went on super quick
easy I got really good coverage it sets
to a matte finish and it feels like you
don't need to set your face so I went in
to blend out my bronzer and weird
happen it got super patchy pretty much
took away all the coverage on the area
of trying to blend I wrote in capital
letters here so bad I then tried to
rescue my face wiped it off on that spot
I put the cushion foundation over again
I set it with a powder and then I tried
to blend bronzer on top and I wrote just
looks bad still for the money I just
don't think this makes sense
I love the Misha magic mm cushion
foundation the jcat foundation over this
for the money I just
don't think it's worth it number 11 this
is licensed surgery this is a Sonia
Kashuk soft focus satin matte foundation
the best word I have to describe this is
just average for me this one doesn't
make sense because it's too dark on me
it doesn't have enough coverage it just
doesn't really add a whole lot mixing
wise when I mix products I usually look
for one thing that the other foundation
doesn't have and this one just really
doesn't have anything to it that I think
would be good to mix in with another
product but I think that you could like
this if you like a matte finish and you
don't need a whole lot of coverage could
be worth giving a try this one is just
pretty average to me alright so now
these last four are my least favorite
these are like the ones that for me I
probably will never be reaching for
again but that being said there's a
couple in here that I know a lot of
people really loved number what are we
on there 12 number 12 is the Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation I know a bunch
of people love this I also found out in
the comment sections a bunch of people
also really dislike this foundation
which I feel like no one really talks
about which I guess why would you but I
didn't realize how many people this also
didn't work for I thought it was just
kind of I had a weird experience with it
l42 confirmed it's definitely different
formula than l44 I just don't like this
I really don't like this it looks so
heavy on my skin the l44 is 50 times
better than L 42 that I previously had
so that's good but it's how you wearing
this again and mixing it with the L 42
and it just looks bad it cakes up pretty
much everywhere it looks super heavy on
my skin swearing this again and playing
around with this it's just too heavy for
me okay number 13 is the Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless this is another
one like the Kat Von D that I just
cannot get to work for me I don't get
great coverage with this but the thing I
really don't like about it is just the
finish of it it feels and looks very
heavy I can just feel it on my face it
feels gross on my skin I feel like I
need to wash my face off a lot of people
love this for me really doesn't work in
kind of my feelings on this have been
confirmed I do not like this
unfortunately number 14 and this was
kind of like a top at 14 or 15
they're both no so number 14 hard candy
glamoflauge mixing pigment drops I tried
these a few different ways by themselves
with other products I pretty much get
zero coverage with these I don't
understand it they do lighten the
products but I just feel so oily and
greasy I wrote down I put in five drops
of these with the boardwalk foundation
it barely lightened it and it also added
no coverage whatsoever if you like these
let me know how you use them and if you
get coverage because I'm like very
confused by this product pretty much its
exact purpose is to be a pigment drop
don't think this is worth spending your
money on I do think they cover FX custom
cover drops are an investment but they
are totally worth spending your money on
like my eyes like being blinded by this
light right now cover FX
definitely worth it over these in my
opinion splurge get it number 15 is the
unique mineral touch liquid foundation
this one is pure grease that's what it
feels like to me when it goes on my skin
it feels super greasy super oily I did
not get good coverage I figured out the
sharpie dilemma thanks to you guys if
you've seen the videos with Sharpie on
their face which is what I talked about
in the video what basically happens is
the oils in this product break down the
Sharpie so it's not actually covering
the sharpies people speculate that it's
literally just breaking down the Sharpie
which makes sense because I got very
light coverage with this I had to use a
ton of products personally I just think
there are better foundations out there
that are worth your money this is what
almost 40 bucks I can't get past the
greasiness of this not the fan alright
so those are all 15 products rank so
this wraps up the second 15 days of
foundation series on my channel I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you have
enjoyed it please give this video a
thumbs up you purchase any of these
products already let me know your
thoughts on them down below if you've
tried them I can't believe series number
two is over I'll be announcing on the
social channels when the next 15 days of
foundation is but don't worry
lots of foundations come in for
foundation for a day love you guys
thanks for watching see in my next video
