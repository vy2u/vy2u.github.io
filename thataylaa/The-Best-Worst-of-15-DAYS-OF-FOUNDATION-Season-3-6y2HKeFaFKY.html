video in ranking for 15 days of
foundation I missed you guys I feel like
this is the longest I have it I have
what I just say Chipotle now I'm going
through coma and my brain is not working
I feel like this is the longest I've
gone without uploading in a long time
like years but I have been I don't think
busy is the right word I've been a
walking zombie trying to get videos
ready to go for while I'm gone the
entire month of May if you're just
stumbling across this video I do a
series called city needs a foundation on
my channel where I test out a new
foundation every single day for 15 days
this past series was April 5th to the
19th and then I usually wait about a
week and do a video talking about all of
them where they stand how they compare
which ones are my favorites which ones
are my not-so favorites so serious
actually takes me over a month to film I
started working on videos a few weeks
before the actual start date so I have
more than a week to test out these
products between the last day that you
guys are saying and now the Foundation's
closer to the beginning I've been
testing for a couple weeks now obviously
the ones at the end I've had less time
to test we have t-shirts and there was
an ebay sale to raise money for project
leader share which is a non-profit you
can donate any of your used makeup and
they distribute it to women shelters I'm
gonna leave the announcement video for
the series down below because I go
in-depth about all of this I just have
to give some background here for the new
folks so if we're just here for the
foundation I feel yeah life's busy I'm
going to put a time stamp right here so
you can fast-forward to this part when I
start talking about foundation I have a
couple things I need to share with you
guys and the first is very exciting it's
how much we raise for project B share
first of all I want to say a huge thank
you to the brand to donated or the eBay
sale I mentioned all of them in the
announcement video but we couldn't have
raised this much money without you guys
so thank you but from the breed bring
cause literally just lettuce a burrito
sale we should do that from the ebay
sale we raised
five thousand four hundred twenty one
dollars and twenty-three cents from the
t-shirts and hoodies which are still
going to be available until this Sunday
morning International shipping is
available in all the designs are
limited-edition for these series so this
is the only time that you're gonna be
able to purchase this design from the
t-shirts so far when I'm filming this
right now it's Wednesday by the way so
we might have raised a little bit more
from the teachers and hoodies you guys
have raised seven thousand forty four
dollars which brings our total to twelve
thousand four hundred sixty-five dollars
and twenty three cents for project we do
share our goal was ten thousand dollars
you guys went above and beyond I just
think that's amazing thank you guys so
much for all of your support
I know project Buescher is very excited
and it's just a really great reminder
that we can do something and make some
kind of impact you but if it's small if
we all come together so a couple other
quick announcements for those of you
guys who are still watching this right
now you haven't fast forwarded they're
the real burritos comment the word
corn-on-the-cob down below if you're
watching this right now and you haven't
fast forwarded other announcements so
again I'm going to be in China May 1st
to the 15th I talked more about it in a
shadow and schmooze video that's going
up on Monday I'm actually going to be in
China when the video goes up I'm going
to have super limited access to social
media aka I'm pretty much not going to
be on social media when I'm in China so
I have three videos a week ready to go
they're going to be scheduled before I
leave so there will still be videos
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time foundation Friday isn't going to
resume until let me see the exact date
resuming on Friday May 19th so they're
still going to be videos Monday
Wednesday Friday they're just not going
to be foundation Friday videos I really
needed a foundation break but I'm
excited to jump back into it once I get
back and the last thing I wanted to give
you a little update on the white mixer
foundation foundation mixers which you
guys have been asking about for about a
year since I first mentioned it that
video is on the calendar it's come in
the end of May bringing about 10 white
foundation mixers to China with me to
test them out I think that's all the
updates I have for you guys I'm going to
be vlogging China I'm also going to be
in Taiwan for a few days so I'll be able
to use social media and Taiwan so I'm
going to put my handles right here if
you're not following you can go do that
I'm very active on snapchat snapchat my
whole life is on there pretty much all
right let's do this so this was a weird
series I usually have a couple really
stand out products I do have a couple of
those products it just wasn't instant
love it was like the
the grows over time there's a couple
that I would call bad and then the vast
majority of them I would say are just
mediocre so what I do when I test out
these products again is try it with a
different primer powder I mix them I
write it down so I have notes and I
remember and then I share with you guys
I'm going to go best to worst I'm going
to start with my top foundation by the
way all the foundations I'm talking
about along with their review videos
will be linked down below in the
description box all right so my number
one foundation from this series which I
feel like might surprise some of you
guys because it wasn't super in love
with it when I first tried it so one has
definitely grown on me this is one that
I reach for the most
I tried out the most because it was day
two no hair
this is the Laura Geller cover lock
foundation wasn't super wowed by this
when I first tried it I liked it I just
didn't think it was amazing this was one
of the foundations that I was trying out
in San Diego again and the more I wore
it the more I liked it so this is the
only foundation I'm talking about that I
can actually wear alone this is the best
match for me out of all two foundations
I don't need to mix this in to adjust
the shade at all I love the finish of
this the thing I love the most about
this is that it's full coverage it looks
like skin and the shade is right I'm
wearing it right now but I actually mix
in a tiny bit of the covergirl clean
matte BB cream in 5 10 this is way too
dark but it's one of my favorite
products to mix in to make them a little
bit longer lasting my one downside to
this is that if you have oily skin I
have combo oily skin I don't think this
one is super long-lasting I get a little
bit of breakdown throughout the day so
I'm still trying to figure out my
favorite way to wear this I've tried it
with powders and I actually like it
better without a powder so far I feel
like it wears best with the high malade
matte 12 primer I just put a little bit
of this on my t-zone and it works pretty
well
still not amazing lasting power but I'm
willing to work with it because I love
the way that it looks on my skin I love
the shade everything else about it is
perfect besides the lasting power on my
skin it is pretty moisturizing and it
has more of a satin dewy finish so if
you have dry skin this one might work
for you if you have oily skin you'll
just need to figure out the best way to
wear it and I posted the picture on
Instagram was like the hoop earrings
that day on snapchat a bunch of you guys
asked what foundation I was wearing and
it was this bad boy I didn't set it with
a powder I just had on this foundation
this one is a close second I think if
the shade was right on this it might
have pulled ahead Laura because the
lasting power for me on this one is
there
definitely one of the most skin-like
finishes I've ever seen in a foundation
this is the dermablend smooth liquid
camo now I did find out that cream is
not the lightest shade linen is
apparently lighter with cool undertones
I'm definitely going to be ordering that
because this shade is just way too dark
for me way too yellow is actually really
hard to mix this in with other products
because it has such a yellow-orange II
kind of base to it any time I tested out
this product mixing it in my shade was
just totally off you can build this up
to get really great coverage but it
literally looks like skin it looks so
beautiful throughout the day so really
can't think of a foundation that this
looks like I feel like this is a pretty
unique product so as soon as I'm done
filming this I'm going to be ordering
the lightest shade linen because I
definitely want to try that out so
number three I feel like you guys
probably saw this one coming is the Max
Factor pan stick foundation I have two
here now because after filming that
video I ordered the lighter shade which
is 25 fara the shade that I reviewed was
12 true beige actually think this one's
easier to work with for me because the
undertone of this is a lot closer to me
I'll swatch them again for you guys to
swatch it in a different video but this
25 fair shade almost looks like a salmon
corrector to me it is that kind of pink
orange colored so here's 25 fair and
here's 12 true beige 12 true beige is
way too dark but it was easier for me to
work with because the undertone is right
this is full coverage beautiful finish
again on my skin it's not super
long-lasting I do get pretty oily
I tried mixing it in with a makeup
forever stick foundation also isn't
super long-lasting on me I just couldn't
find good way to mix this in I tried my
fan with a white stick foundation the
Maryland one which I do not like that
did not go well so then I might have
been with the makeup forever stick
foundation and I said it with my Laura
Geller powder and my notes I said it
looked okay but heavy lasted better but
still oily so I think this is another
one that I have to play around and try
and figure out how I can wear this it
looks pretty similar to the Jolie stick
foundation so if you like that you might
like this one actually thought number
four was going to be a little bit higher
once I played around with it but I can't
get this to quite work for me this is
the flower beauty BB cream so the shade
of this is very very very yellow it's
almost like the dermablend where it's
really hard to work with even mixed in
with the product I literally can only
use like a dab of this if I mix it in
with something this one has really good
coverage full coverage
which is awesome for a BB cream it just
doesn't wear quite as well as I'd like
it to I get a little bit heavy
increasing throughout the day tried to
mix this in with a few different
products but I felt like because I
needed something super pink toned kind
of a thinner consistency but that wasn't
going to take away a lot of the coverage
just couldn't find the right thing to
mix in with this it can look a tiny bit
heavy but I think mixed in with the
right thing this could be really nice
pairing it to the covergirl clean matte
BB cream this one looks 10 times more
smooth on the skin this controls my oil
amazing this one not so much but the
flower definitely has way better
coverage than the covergirl so I like
this one I'm not totally totally in love
but I think it's a good product if you
like full coverage match and you have
more yellow undertones you might really
like this shade I would say if you have
dry skin probably not the product for
you alright so number 5 is the 16 brand
16 the room cream this is the full
coverage cream foundation comes in a
little jar very exciting very beautiful
while I was mixing foundations I kind of
rediscovered the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation I have a little review on
this I don't like it by itself looks
pretty heavy and cakey on me by itself
but I actually really like mixing this
in with products I mix these two
together and when I wear this on
snapchat that day I got a bunch of
questions about what I was wearing
always know it's a good combo when I get
a lot of snaps from you guys about it so
this is what I mixed this helped to
lighten it and made it a little bit more
pink tone but I got full coverage with
this combination the only thing is that
it felt a little bit heavy to me both of
these are very sick but I like this I
almost feel like the l'oreal true match
foundation could be good mixed in with
this because that has more of its thin
consistency that one breaks me out
massively so I can't usually use it
actually really liked the lime tone it
up color I think I'm going to continue
to use this underneath foundations it's
really helped to tone down the redness
in my face my con yesterday I filmed the
haul video in the entire first half the
video my mic was off and I'm paranoid
checking the mic every two seconds so
there's always kind of this cutoff where
it's like these are the products that I
recommend anything below this line is
where it gets not so great this is the
last product above the line this is the
Maybelline Dream matte mousse foundation
so such an old product it was one of
those that I just wanted to test out
that I haven't used in years and I
really like this I think if I didn't
have acne and if the shade was a little
bit closer to me I would really love
this because it lasts a
on my skin oh say it's up there with
like the covergirl clean matte as far as
the lasting power on me this one kept me
super matte it looks nice and smooth it
can look a little bit dry if you have
dry skin stay away from this actually is
my hard candy hydrating mist over the
top of it and it kind of brought life
back to my skin shade on this is a
little off I don't think this is full
coverage you have a lot to cover up you
probably wouldn't like this but if
you're just like a medium coverage super
lightweight mattifying foundation and
one of the shades actually matches you
you might really like this so number
seven for me is where we go below that
line I want to like this one so bad I
really do
Estee Lauder Double Wear can't make it
work for the life of me it just looks so
foundational on my skin I'll see it on
other people and it looks amazing I did
Seattle meetup this past weekend and one
of you guys was actually wearing the
Estee Lauder Double Wear and it looked
amazing on your skin it looks nothing
like that on my skin does control my oil
well I'll give it that it just looks
very heavy I think this is one that if I
really found that perfect foundation to
mix this with I could like it because it
does give really good coverage and it
controls my oil it just doesn't have the
best kind of finish on my skin just my
two cents
some people love this some people hate
it like any product so number eight is
another one that a lot of people love I
don't think this is a bad product like I
mentioned in the video I really like
mixing this in with other foundations so
this is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation this one for me just looks
super chalky it's the most bizarre thing
I really don't get good coverage with
this at all like a fairly medium
coverage just get this weird texture on
my face with it that video I mentioned
that my old favorite foundation combo
was the elf acne fighting foundation
mixed with the 101 shade I didn't get a
chance to try that out again but I might
do that in a shadow missionaries or
something just so you guys can see it
just doesn't allow me on its own
speaking ones that I'm not super wowed
by the co Gendo aqua foundations the
reason why I ranked this lower than the
Estee Lauder and L'Oreal for the price
of this I just think there are so much
better foundations that give you a
similar kind of effect if you're looking
for lighter coverage with like a glowy
skin like look there are other
foundations that are not $62 I love the
shade of this one but I do get the
pilling so we tried mixing it in with
the Estee Lauder one sea hose this one
one c1 cool bone I tried my seen those
two together because I figured
this one could give it more of like a
skin-like look and help lighten it and
oddly enough I still got the little
white dots pilling and for the price tag
for me it just doesn't bring enough to
the table
number ten is the Elizabeth Arden
flawless finish mousse makeup I think
this is one that's going to work for a
very specific skin type and just look
that you're going for
it's very natural-looking I actually
really like the finish of this it's just
a little average or other more natural
skin like foundations I just think I
like a little bit better packaging of
this and just like the whole vibe at
like 80s hairspray vibes from this
packaging I don't know this one is just
super blah to me I don't know fish is
because of the whole thing like the
concealer the shade the oil I don't know
I didn't hate this one in the video I
just think this does nothing that it
actually says it does it's definitely
not mattifying it is super dewy when you
first put it on and it definitely
doesn't cover a whole lot the concealer
or the actual foundation if you want
kind of a similar effect both better
coverage I love the Garnier BB cream the
oily version I used to use that back in
the day when I was self-tan that shade
is way too dark for me even to mix in
with products but that is beautiful and
it kind of reminds me of this just with
better coverage we're onto number 12
number 12 is one that is just super
mediocre to me I don't even know what to
say about this one because there's
nothing that stands out I feel like in
most foundations I can see something in
them that someone might like even if
it's not necessarily myself this is one
that I just don't see that I don't think
the lasting power was goods the finish
of this I do not like it looks
foundation II just all of it I'm not
that into and I don't think this is
worth your money so as I said in this
video I do not try this one again
because this was one of those products
that I put it on and I instantly knew I
did not like it you know when you have
those products that whatever it is
there's something about it that you're
not feeling for me number 13 is the
cover effects total cover cream
foundation someone just looked and felt
too heavy for me if you have more dry
skin you might like this because it is
very luminous I can see how if you
didn't have to put quite as much on to
get coverage it may wear better this one
was just a no for me so two left
you guys probably know which ones are
left number fourteen kind of surprised
me because I really liked it when I
first put it on
Foundation had a really nice kind of
soft focus matte finish good coverage
the shade was off very yellow but
everything else about it I liked when I
first put it on this one just got
significantly shitty as the day went on
midpoint check-in it just looked bad it
looked almost like how the Kat Von D
lock-it foundation looks on my skin it
looks really dry in certain areas it got
really cakey and heavy in certain areas
at the end of the day it almost got
patchy could just be one of those things
that it just wears bad on my skin like I
always say just because I don't like a
product doesn't mean that you won't some
products work amazing for some people
that do not work at all for me and vice
versa
so this is just my opinion in my
experience with these products it
doesn't mean that they're necessarily
bad products besides this last one
number 15 which I would say it's a bad
product oh my heart rate goes up just
thinking about this so this was the $80
custom foundation if you watched that
video you probably saw this coming but
pretty much every aspect of this product
was kind of a fail not only does this
one look bad on my skin the shade is off
and that's kind of their whole thing
with this is a custom foundation your
correct shade you're correct coverage
all of that pretty much everything about
this product just missed the mark the
one thing I do like about this is that I
thought it was a fun experience is it an
$80 for a fun experience probably not
you could go to Disneyland or buy 80
burritos this review video goes really
in-depth about why I don't like this so
I'm not going to go into it here but
number 15 for you those are all the
foundations you guys have purchased any
of these from the series already you've
been trying them out let me know what
you think of them down below the top 2's
to me are definitely stand out products
starts kind of weird how my top twos
looked really similar I'm just realizing
what's the heck if you guys try these
out if they work for you if they didn't
work for you let me know down below I'm
always curious I don't have dates or
months or anything yet set for the next
15 years of foundation but I always up
to you guys on social media just want to
thank you guys for all of your support
not only for projects video share but
