dad tagged in she won I do feel about
that yeah so we're just gonna answer the
normal Montague questions and then I
also post on Instagram and ask you guys
to ask any other questions that you want
her to answer so really excited number
one what was I like as a child
very you were a very good child it's
very quiet
we've called or is it cleaner bit
clearer yeah really used to cling to us
what do you think of me making YouTube
videos I'm so proud of you making
YouTube videos I don't know how you can
get in front of the camera and do this
and be so comfortable what's something
funny I did when I was younger this is
all been the other night so you can take
your time thinking can you pause it
right now so I can think okay I want to
phone a friend dad okay so what I
remember is you dad used to make funny
faces and you would copy whatever fun
face he made you want to do what have
you learned anything about makeup /
beauty from me I don't wear that much
makeup so I used to do when I was living
here I used to do her makeup sometimes
sometimes I'll help her like pick out
stuff at the drugstore or something yeah
but she doesn't really she doesn't wear
that much makeup she doesn't need makeup
what's a weird habit of mine oh god
playing with your hair I guess with my
hair yeah yeah I guess your ears oh I
know you're right have it top you are
just this week when she cooks or when
she's like focus and she like goes like
this he'd totally do that if you had to
rename your daughter
what would you name her Riley really
yeah that's what I want
Riley Randy at Robin Hood day you're not
named Riley when you guys go to eat what
did she order for reuse what is one
thing you wish you would do I wish you
would do yeah
gosh I think you've done everything why
was she wouldn't have so many headaches
yeah what something I do that annoys you
you talk really fast and I always have
to ask you a second time with us and
they're like I just talk quiet now fast
like super fast it's hard to understand
what you're saying what's something are
you obsess over yeah no I think you
don't get enough so you keep going and
going going and you don't get enough
sleep so I guess you look like
overworking overworking yeah where would
you like to see me in ten years with a
cute guy hopefully husband at least one
kid yeah same when were you most proud
of me I would say when you went to study
abroad and Jordan and then went to
Israel after so you were gone for a year
but I felt so proud that you were brave
enough to do that to go live in the
Middle East what's the worst thing I've
ever done I was such a good kid you know
it's so easy to get in trouble cuz you
never got in trouble I remember one time
I think back to my childhood there's one
moment that sticks out I was like when
you were like the most mad at me well
there's one time when you lied about
where you were yeah
dad go pick her up when she was in sofas
hi never gonna move your truck what's
your favorite moment of us together
what's yours well I guess not really us
together but I senior year of high
school I did this charity thing and we
had
of it and you have to like write a
letter to your mom and read it out loud
and I feel like that was my favorite I
think it's not one moment but seeing it
was senior year and after school a few
days a week you would call me and say
hey mom you want to meet for coffee yeah
we go and then you hit me have to go
shopping at T so yeah so we go have
coffee and then go to TJ met I felt like
a girlfriend yes how was I in school
hurt a good student but not like very
real no I always felt like he could be
more outgoing yeah I was not I mean I'm
still not super outgoing I wouldn't say
I'm not going with my like close-knit
group of friends but I was never as
people that had like 30 different
friends and guys quiet in school and I
did my work and I did what I had to do
to get through high school I never
really enjoyed high school I love middle
school I think I was the same way in
high school what would you change if you
could raise me again I think I would try
to be more open to you being an
individual and the person that you are
just to support you more not expect you
to be a different person than you were I
described my perfect type of guy tall
really tall I think every quicker and I
thought hasn't been over like 511 yeah
and I'm for all of it pretty good
looking really sweet guys with sense
good sense of humor very comfortable
with themselves I would say yeah it's
smart
yeah and ambitious - yeah yeah yeah the
bar is high yeah okay so now we're going
on to Instagram so Haley Stokes 37 says
do you guys have any mom daughters
should its traditions well the coffee
thing yeah coffee and shopping yeah we
have a lot
well I called them every day oh yeah
when she's walking to her car yeah I
hold them coming home from work every
day yeah that is a tradition what's it
like having Taylor do YouTube do you
watch her videos says Emily love xxx 3 I
don't watch him that much isn't that
funny I love it when I do and I shoot
more her dad watches that almost
everyone makeup diva one one line that
says what is the hardest thing about
living away from your daughters I want
to be a mom when she's sick or she's
having trouble or she doesn't have
enough time and I wanted to want to be
there to help and I'm too far away to do
that I think the hardest thing for me is
seeing other people like at work or
friends or stuff in Seattle who have
their parents there and just like doing
things on the weekends with them or just
like being able to get coffee or
whatever yeah any time what do you guys
have most in common so as lovely little
those I feel like I'm starting to become
more like her everyday organization
my name is Shane we see Sammy OCD is
yeah I kick you she's a graphic designer
and I think I get a lot of my creative
stuff from her crafty - yeah
does your mom enjoy burritos just as
much as you know dad likes rose did you
see Taylor becoming who she is today
when she was young not at all
I had never imagined her turning into
such an independent and ambitious and
smart you've turned your career into
something you would love to but mostly
the independence and you're just you
know gutsy ABC are negated sub stealers
YouTube career affected you in any way
just mate makes me feel proud it's just
amazing to me what is one piece of
advice you always gave to Taylor that
she never listens to but now she knows
you've been right all along and wishes
she had listened wow what a good first
question that should be in a self-help
book wow that should be a question she
yeah I think that's more for me nice oh
I know they always when I was younger
they would always say like if you
committed to something you have to fully
follow through with it like it whether
it's with plans or like something you're
doing you can't just bail yeah she
wanted to quit piano lessons after a
month and we made her take it for like
two years Sarah Beecher says can you
describe how awkward it was in middle
school how awkward and maybe I wasn't oh
she wasn't awkward at all good circle of
friends and middle school was great yeah
went downhill in high school Katie loved
makeup says what was your first reaction
to your daughter's starting YouTube I
thought it was the dumbest thing in the
world and they were like what is the
girl doing in the room by herself for 4
hours 4 hours and me what is she doing
in there they were not they did not get
to that first I'm Maria XO says
basically was I ever interested in
makeup as a young child I would say it
really started big-time probably
sophomore year gradually got into makeup
and stuff I would say yeah I don't even
remember it I only let you wear light
white eyeshadow white or light blue
eyeshadow probably the network's choices
I could have gotten nude lip gloss
nothing no color retro Jo says what's
your favorite thing about Taylor I love
you guys you look beautiful
I love Taylor's energy and ambition I'm
on a career level that I really admire
that generous with people and you care
about your friends thoughtful until I
was young what did she want to be when
she got older well she wanted to sell
cotton candy at seaworld career goal
when you are like 10 okay and then
photographer before you decided you
might be an interpreter put your glasses
on what's your mom's favorite story
about you from
when you're little so we had one of
these little sling this all I can say is
advice if you're a parent listen to the
warnings on the bottom if you had this
little carrier and it says don't set it
on a counter or table like a baby bass
yeah Taylor's about I don't know maybe
three months old we had it sitting on
this marble table so we thought who will
be final to stick her up on the table
and one minute later which she's kicked
in her legs and moving her hands in the
and the carrier's inching its way
towards the end of the table we couldn't
make it in time and she they didn't call
the ER and we always tell her we always
tell her she's really smart but she
could've been a genius sometimes I need
to know what she uses to look so young
exercise in no moisturizer co-ed no
moisture in seconds
I think that's everything I think
sweating every day makes you say that
duly noted not happening all right so
that was the mom tag if you guys liked
this video give it a thumbs up so I know
love you guys thanks for watching and
see you in my next video are you looking
there no you know after this yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
