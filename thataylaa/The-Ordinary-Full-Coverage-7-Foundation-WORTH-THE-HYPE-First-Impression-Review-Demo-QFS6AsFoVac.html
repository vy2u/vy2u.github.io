Friday and we're talking about a
foundation that has been so freaking
hard to get my hands on this has been
extremely hyped up it was backordered
they did a restock they ran out of pumps
they're having some issues this is the
new ordinary coverage foundation and
came out with the serum foundation that
supposed to be light to medium coverage
and then this is the high coverage
formula I placed this order on April
29th and it took over a month to get
here I know they were having a lot of
issues because they got more orders than
they were expecting so I actually picked
up five different shades of this
foundation I had no idea what shade I
was going to be and I also just wanted
to swatch the five lightest shades for
you guys so you can get an idea of how
different each one is and what they
actually look like so there are a couple
super exciting things about this
foundation the first thing is that it
comes in 21 shades I'm going to get more
into their shade range in a second but
the second thing is that it retails for
only $6.99 product that's cheaper than
about 90 oh that's great how long about
a generation of my hair welcome to my
channel I just watched back some of the
footage you guys are about to see and
there's definitely foundation in my hair
the whole time we can just ignore that
that's cheaper than about 90% of
drugstore foundations now the fact that
this is under 7 bucks it's supposed to
have really great ingredients in it this
is from the DCM brand I'm pretty sure
they have a few different lines or
brands underneath them one of my
favorite primers salsa by them let's hop
on to their website to read some of the
claims they have a very long description
on their website so I'm just going to
hit some of the main points full
coverage foundation 21 shades has a
higher pigment level than their serum
foundation but it says it's still
supposed to offer a smooth finish that
avoids the heavy makeup look this is
silicon based textures lightweight non
oily cream so this is a semi matte
finish you guys will see what I think
about that claim compatible with most
primers and is formulated to work
exceptionally well with the primers
offering from the ordinary obviously
they're not going to say it works best
with maybelline primers I love the fact
that they have 21 shades but I also love
how they broke down the shade range
shades are divided into three categories
the one starting in one are for fair -
lighter tones - medium tones and three
for darker tones and then they basically
break it down even further and have the
undertones listed which is great they
also have a second
a within for example the one shade range
there's 1.1 1.2 they have pretty much
all the undertones they also have this
interesting silver thing going on s
indicates silver highlights and G
indicates gold highlights I did get one
of the shades with s in it so you guys
will see what that looks like in the
swatches it says I have a finely
dispersed metallic effect for added
highlight not sure why you want silver
gold in your foundation
alright so swatch time I have the five
shades of the ordinary foundation right
here and then I have three others just
so you can compare them to I will say
these have been on my arm for about 30
seconds and they've already oxidized so
starting from the left this first one is
the shade 1.0 and very fair in neutral
next over is 1.0 P very fair with pink
undertones the third one is 1.0 n s very
fair neutral with silver highlights this
is when the shades are supposed to have
those silver highlights in there I don't
know if I totally see it then we have
one point one n which is fair neutral
and one point one P which is fair pink
and I think this one has definitely
oxidized the most so far out of all the
shades so then right here is the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation and 0.5
derma call to 0-8 which is a good shade
match for me and Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless 110 packaging even though
it's really simple I like it it has kind
of a matte effect to it the top is a
matte black and it's just really simple
I like their font Cosi free vegan when
I'm filling this they have a little note
on here that says they're not currently
fulfilling more orders you can't sign up
for email notifications to get notified
when they're back in stock so I've heard
some really rave things about the
foundation I've also heard some pretty
crap things about this like every
product works differently for different
people this is just my opinion
if you want to see what I think of the
ordinary coverage foundation and how it
applies somewhere throughout the day
you're in the right place just keep
watching I actually did my hair for once
and you can't even see it great so I've
already washed moisturize prime my face
I used my to normal moisturizer primer
these are gonna be linked down below
this is actually by the same brand the
DCM brand this has been my go-to primer
lately helps keep me a little bit more
matte than usual so after doing those
arm swatches I think I'm going to go
with 1.1 P which was the darkest one
that I swatch because I do have some
color right now I'm a little bit
sunburned I think this one might work I
don't know I can always mix in a little
bit lighter if it's too dark so one half
on my face I'm going to try the Sigma
f80 flat to the Q brow
on the other side my morphe sponge is
opener with no okay so I'm going to give
this a good shake
it sounds pretty liquidy in here this is
no top for this I like that it has a
twist lock so if you're traveling your
makeups not going to hopefully squirt
all over one full pump is about that
much let's put out two pumps let's see
how much we need we're going to pounce
this on the bottom of my sponge and then
let's go to town whoa whoa whoa this
amount is spreading really far I haven't
dipped my sponge back in yet okay
officiate oxidizes which I think it will
cause I did on my hand there's a little
dark I might make some tiny bit of 1.0 n
I'm just going to mix that directly and
test it down here okay yeah that one's
quite a bit lighter blending this out
just feel super effortless I'm going to
try and mix those two shades a bit for
my forehead like you really don't need a
lot of this I'm just wiping off what
overs on my hand so that just completely
covered the acne on the center of my
forehead it looks super smooth so at
that amount it isn't totally full
coverage I can definitely still see
redness and freckles coming through
definitely go in for a bit of a second
layer right here to build it up but
let's do the other side first with a
brush and see how it goes hopefully this
shade mixing is better okay definitely
got a better shade on this side Oh
literally just nailed my eye with a
brush and get applies just as well with
a brush I'm getting about the same
coverage I might have gone a little more
coverage on the brush side but the way
that this is sitting on my skin right
now is just beautiful I'm looking pretty
dewy right now I'm going to go with this
thin second layer just so you can see if
this is buildable and I also want to
cover some more of this stuff down here
they say this is semi-matte because this
is looking super duty to me semi-matte
finish hmm I don't think I agree with
that one unless this sets down about
five notches so it is building totally
fine doesn't really look like you're
adding any more product clear face which
is great having some issues with these
shades I feel like my face is ten shades
right now I feel like it's still not
covering my super dark as like a really
pigmented spot right here it's not
totally covering but it looks beautiful
it's not kicking up anywhere this looks
like skin definitely doesn't look like I
have two layers of foundation on it
looks really good on my forehead
I have a couple not wrinkles made their
wrinkles in them lines on my forehead
and it kind of just blurted over them
the center of my forehead looks really
good where I have a lot of texture
yeah the texture on my skin right now
looks almost blurred I'm a little bit
concerned with how my oil is going to go
with this because it looks very almost
oily right now it's a little too doing
for me but I'm definitely going to set
this one I've seen a few videos on this
where people have gotten really oily
with just by the end of the night so I'm
definitely going to use kind of a
mattifying powder because I already get
oily I don't want to be a total stick of
butter right now it's 9:30 in the
morning I'm going to do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back literally
right when I turn on the camera they
start vacuuming obviously haven't done
the rest of my makeup yet but I just
came out here to look in the mirror what
it looks like in front of my window and
I just have to show you guys this
because it looks frickin flawless on my
eyebrows situation right now but look at
how smooth this looks on my face my
forehead rarely looks like this it looks
like I have no texture up there as you
can see not totally full coverage even
on those two layers but just look at the
finish of this I just wanted you guys to
see what it looks like before I powder
my face and everything to just calm down
sir all right so it's now 10:20 so it's
been a few minutes I'm going to call the
check-in time 9:40 since that's when I
finished up my face makeup and I ended
up setting out with the Maybelline
mapmaker powder I know this isn't one of
my usual powders for testing foundations
but this is one of the few that's
actually very mattifying this is kind of
similar to the Rimmel stay matte powder
but typically when I use this powder it
completely modifies my face I use a
light hand with this today but when I
put this on top of my foundation the
glow is still coming through so I feel
like that speaks a lot about how do
this foundation really is but I love
that if I can use a mattifying powder
but still see the foundation coming
through wash back out there after I did
my powder and everything and it still
looked amazing I'm getting a little bit
creasing now in one of the lines up here
but we'll just see how we're is
throughout the day so in the rest of my
face I use the Physicians Formula insta
ready super BB bronzer then I went in to
contour a little bit more with the MUA
eyebrow kit this shade right here
use the Catrice illuminating blush in
love Ian Rose put that in the foundation
whoops
since my skin is super glowy I just
wanted to go in with more of a natural
highlight so I'm trying this out this is
the essence pure nude highlighter still
have foundation on here but I just got a
little I thought this was going to be
way too dark so but when I put it on my
face it's somehow working and for all of
the warm toned shades on my eyes right
now I'm using the Urban Decay Naked heat
palette I'll put that essence highlight
on my inner corner and then
holy-shit sees where'd I put it these
are balm this is the new Makeup Forever
aqua XL color paint these are super
pigmented eyeshadows you can use them as
basis eyeshadows alone primers it's
obviously the teal color on my lid right
now list I was boring and just stuck
with one of my go-to combos this is the
Maybelline food whisper pencil with the
4s 32 liquid lipstick and then my MUA
lip gloss and baby pink for call in and
check in time 9:40 the next check and I
do will be in natural lighting so see
you guys in a few hours
alright so it is 240 so it's been on for
five hours pretty much I peeled off my
false lashes by the way I forgot to say
but earlier is wearing the pseudo beauty
Giselle lashes but they're not so let's
do a little update so 5 hours of wear
not a lot it's not looking the best in
certain areas I'm using you guys in
pre-warning my under-eye concealer is
disastrous right now I don't know what's
going on but like super super crazy
today
so a few things going on around my nose
and upper lip looks pretty bad for only
5 hours this is pretty intense creasing
around my nose I mean it's like coming
off right there and then when I stop
talking I have like 3 or 4 crease marks
above my lips right now I wouldn't say
my forehead looks bad by any means it
just doesn't look the best like my acne
is like taking through in certain spots
and then you can see it kind of settle
and on my foreheads it doesn't look
quite as smooth as it did before so
right now I'm not super impressed I was
liking it about 50 times better five
hours ago but we'll see how it wears by
the end of the night I'm going to keep
this on film the second video today just
finished editing one and I'm going as a
second one so here we go
it's about 6:30 so foundations been on
for nine hours I am ending this an hour
early because they don't see my subs
changing on it anytime soon and I just
really need to wash my face right now I
should pack so I'm not as oily as I
thought I was going to be at this point
on my forehead it's just overall not
looking great I feel like it looks like
just worn off overall my ask me is
coming through I feel like the coverage
has just kind of worn off the other day
my blush and bronzer really did not stay
on that well it almost looks like I got
a little bit patchy or some things you
still have the separation on the center
of my forehead it doesn't look horrible
at all on my forehead appeared like any
worse and last check in but as you guys
can see is just kind of totally rubbed
off on my upper lip I don't like how it
looks around my nose at all and then
also on my chin I'm getting creasing
right here which I never get I'd say the
first hour was really great and then
after that point it's just not my
favorite this one might be good to mix
in with a longer lasting foundation I'm
just not totally impressed with this one
it's only six bucks so it could be worth
giving a go but if you have any kind of
imperfections or oily skin or anything
like that you might just really need to
work with this one to make it work if
you have more normal skin with less to
cover up you might really like this this
one did not work out for me
unfortunately bye I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and like foundation
Fridays if you do make sure you give it
a thumbs up it helps me out love you
guys thanks for watching see you my next
video bye
