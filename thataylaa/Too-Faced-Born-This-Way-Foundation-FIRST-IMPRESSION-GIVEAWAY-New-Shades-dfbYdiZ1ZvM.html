the day has come
- bass came out with pale princess
friendly shades battle of two-faced if
you follow the whole makeup scene on
Instagram or YouTube or basically if you
just live on this planet right now you
probably heard people raving about this
foundation so while ago when it first
came out to face oh there's a lot of
dust on here we can ignore that two-face
sent out crazy PR packages of every
single shade of the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation their lightest shade
porcelain let me just show you this was
their lightest shade that they
originally launched with this is the
shade porcelain here's their new
lightest shade snow you can see the
difference this is like no words the
shade was too dark for me to even mix
with other foundations this is like an
NC 25 probably 25 to 30 even this is
their new lightest shade snow which I'm
wearing right now so to base came out
with six new shades to the Born This Way
Foundation two shades lighter than the
shade porcelain and then six shades no
four shades there's the map four shades
darker than the shade caramel so if you
have a deeper skin tone or a paler skin
tone the Too Faced gods have listened
super excited I could finally try out
this foundation for you guys it's
supposed to be a undetectable medium to
full coverage foundation this retails
for $39 right now you can only get the
new shades on Too Faced website I
believe if you use Ebates you can get
four percent cashback so that's what I
did save some money
Sephora still only has 12 shades of the
foundation so I blame you shades are
exclusively on Too Faced
so this is an oil-free foundation that
masterfully diffuses the line between
makeup and skins infused with coconut
water and it doesn't have a coconutty
smell really at all it actually smells
kinda nice not super scented but it
doesn't smell like one of those
chemically foundations and also says it
has Alpine rose don't know what that it
in hyaluronic acid or a smoother more
youthful appearance if you have dry skin
this will probably work really well for
you since it does have coconut water in
it I have normal to combo skin I tend to
get a little bit oily throughout the day
but nothing crazy so you can just apply
a smaller amount from the center face
outwards if you want less coverage and
if you want more full coverage you can
layer it which
is what I did you'll see how the shade
blends out on my face I think it's
doable it's a little bit more yellow
tone that I prefer but it definitely
does match my neck okay it doesn't look
super dark I am going to be doing a
giveaway for the nine other shades that
I have right here they're just sitting
in my drawer right now so I figured why
not give it to you guys so there are
going to be nine different winners all
the giveaway info will be listed in the
description box this is to check in
throughout the day kind of first
impressions video so if you want to see
my thoughts on this foundation you're
the right place just keep watching mmm
feeling great earrings
all right I've already primed my face
with the body shop tea tree primer this
is my favorite primer use it every
single day I think we're just going to
go in with this bad boy I think this is
from eBay all my other foundation
brushes are like fully fully dirty right
now so this is in the shade snow this is
the lightest shade that they made in
their new Jade release thing what the
lightest shade that they have I'm just
going to put this on the back of a
little palette this looks pretty yellow
I'm just going to start by dabbing it on
my face I haven't used this foundation
at all by itself before even the darker
shades because I would always have to
mix it so I've no idea what this going
to be like wool
if you follow me on snapchat i swatched
this on my hand next to the new makeup
for ever ultra HD foundation and if you
have pale skin the lightest shade of
that foundation is like super pale like
a little bit too light for me and this
just looks so dark compared to that this
is also just way more yellow toned but
it seems to be working okay
alright let's do a little side-by-side
really good coverage I mean yeah just
with that one layer oh so this is like a
medium medium to full coverage right now
if I layered it on those spots it would
definitely build up to full coverage I
think looking nice doesn't look cakey or
anything has like a satin finish let's
do the rest of the face I'm going to put
about a half a pump more on the back of
that pallet if you have nice skin
already and don't need a lot of coverage
you could probably do your whole face
and like half a pump - a pump
someone needs to invent a foundation
that you can blow your nose with it it
doesn't come off like come on we can go
to the moon although does anyone else
think they need tattoos that come off in
like a few years why can't we invent
that I'm just dabbing the some on my
forehead are we afraid
I'm liking the finish so far very satiny
if you like a matte foundation this
definitely isn't match this is what it's
looking like with one layer so far so
good I'm going to go back in and just
kind of spot conceal on a few spots so
we need more coverage I definitely like
my foundations a little bit more pink I
feel like with my skin it can go either
way but I just feel like it looks better
on me when I have a mark pink cone
foundation builds really nicely doesn't
look cakey at all like looks seriously
just like skin do you think I'll ever be
a day when like all guys my foundation
first impressions no complaints so far
it looks super nice on the skin it's not
emphasizing my pores at all not clinging
on to any drag patches and it's giving
me pretty dang good coverage so I'm
going to go ahead whoa come back so I'm
going to apply the rest of my makeup and
I'll be right back
alright so here's what the foundation
looks like with all of my makeup on I am
really freaking liking this my concealer
and everything blend it out super easily
it set in about one to two minutes so
super fast I personally love that
because when I'm getting ready in the
morning I don't have to wait around for
my foundation to set it doesn't feel
completely dry but it's like not moving
around like it feels like it's good to
go tiny bit of transfer but like nothing
crazy definitely has like a luminous
finish you can see on my forehead I
didn't set it with a powder or anything
just because I haven't been doing that
lately if I do set my foundation with a
powder it's usually the maybelline
what's called fit me matte and poreless
I didn't want to do that because it
totally changes like the color finish
and everything of the foundation no
setting powder today is 10:30 in the
morning the parents are in town so we're
probably just going to eat and eat I'll
check back in throughout the day so you
can see how the foundation wears be
right back I just want to quickly show
you guys what this looks like in natural
lighting I actually really like the
shade of it and natural lighting it
looks a lot more less yellow looks super
nice dewy feeling it so far also here's
my pumpkin cousin I don't see it mmm
look at this winner alright it is 4:30
right now this is gonna be my last
check-in because I honestly feel like
crap right now sorry I couldn't keep
this on for the whole day but I'm
probably gonna like take a shower and go
to bed for the day I have been blowing
my nose a lot and it actually stayed on
pretty well like you can see redness
around my nose but it's nothing compared
to what it usually looks like when I
blow my nose with foundation on I had a
migraine earlier and I was laying on
this side of my face for like an hour
and a half so we're doing that like it
stayed on pretty frickin well my
forehead is definitely looking a little
bit oily a--probably set this foundation
with a powder next time but as far as
like everything staying on my blush
bronzer highlight are all fully on
lipstick is looking real good right now
overall next time I'll probably mix it
with the Make Up For Ever foundation to
lighten it a little bit then also set it
with a powder if you guys have tried
