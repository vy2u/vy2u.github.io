everything
all right so today it is day 14 of 15
days of foundation we only have one more
day left
I feel like this series has done by
really fast this time around like
watching it back not filming but today
we're gonna be talking about a new
release this is by Too Faced it's the
new peach perfect comfort matte
foundation I was hesitant to buy this
because personally I despise the scent
of the other two-faced peach products it
makes me wanna gag but I asked you guys
on snapchat if you wanted to see this
foundation and a bunch of you did so
here we are first of all we have to have
a moment of appreciation for this box
because it's one of those soft boxes
that is so great
here's the foundation looks like I think
the packaging is beautiful gold pull off
top with a squeeze tube and a pump those
foundation retails for $36 and you get
one point-six fluid ounces of product so
you actually get a ton more than a
standard fluid ounce of product so I
think that's pretty great it says peach
perfect is infused with a refreshing
peach and sweet fig cream in our
exclusive come from out long wearing 14
our formula modern way to wear matte
foundation photo-friendly smooth
flawless and comfortable with a soft
focus velvety finish
so this oil-free 14 hour we're oil
controlling so I do have combination
skin I get oily throughout the day it
says it's transfer resistant medium
coverage so all that sounds great to me
I have the lightest shade which is snow
I'm in service washes right here of the
shades snow in the peach perfect
compared to the two based Born This Way
Foundation and also if you have their
foundations that I on alright we have
quite an armful of swatches right now
because I'm so watching like 3 days
worth of videos in one day right here's
the Too Faced peach perfect foundation
in the lightest shade snow next to it is
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
in the same shade snow dermablend
flawless crater drops in n0 cover FX
drops and n10 milk makeup foundation and
fair Urban Decay Naked skin 0.5
dermablend no derma call to 0-8 and pur
cosmetics bare at all in porcelain so
that's all the claims on this foundation
if you're new here days 1 through 13 are
linked down below in a playlist along
with everything you need to know about
the series you can join the burrito
family and subscribe we'd love to have
you so if you want to see what I think
of the Too Faced peach perfect comfort
Matt Foundation and how it applies and
where throughout the day you're in the
right place just keep watching okay so
it's 9:15 in the morning I need way more
coffee right now feels like day 14 has
arrived it's now September 10th which
means I've been filming these videos for
over a month
whoa okay so ready wash moisturize and
prime my face using the Revlon
Photoready pore reducing primer I
literally just put this on my for on my
fours on my forehead and I'm a Porsche
okay so the shade snow in the Born This
Way Foundation which I have an old video
on I kind of want to get the right shade
in that foundation because I really did
like it I just haven't found the right
shade for me so I never reach for it but
anyways snow is too yellow the snow the
description said rosy undertones so I'm
hoping this matches a little bit better
I haven't swatch this or anything yet
okay this scent I'm just gonna brace
myself because I'm not a fan of the
peach scent don't smell anything yet so
let's pump this out ooh and it feels
really like luxurious something about
this very thick
okay I'm gonna shake this little cuz it
looks a little bit runnier than I was
expecting is my gun so one half of my
face I'm gonna try it with the elf
ultimate blending brush and on the other
where did I just put my sponge okay and
then on the other half of my face the
morphe sponge I'm excited for this one I
haven't seen any videos on this yet no
idea how this is gonna look or coverage
or anything oh by the way I feel like
this is like 15 days of piercings at
this point but we have some new
additions because this fell out the gold
thing fell out so I had to get a
replacement put in and then I had credit
so I was like okay let's just do another
piercing so I got this one beard who
knows we might have a new piercing
tomorrow
doesn't smell like peach to me smells
really sweet but definitely not nearly
as bad as the eyeshadow palette or those
lip glosses Oh whew
it says this is supposed to be medium
coverage I feel like it's getting a
little bit better coverage and I was
anticipating it feels thick but in like
a gel kind of creamy way which I like
because I feel like it kind of plumps
the skin a little bit okay it is
mattifying a little when I first put it
on it looks pretty dewy now it
definitely is starting to mattify a bit
I think this shade works pretty well for
me it's looking nice oh and it's like
setting down see how it looks on the
forehead
looking good wow it really mattifies
down you can see the difference and
finish between my forehead when you
first put it on and then over here it's
like a soft matte finish down here okay
let's try this sponge on the other side
just smoothing this out with the sponge
ooh
after you smooth it out with this sponge
it looks friggin flawless this is a
smoothing foundation which is awesome if
you have texture like it's looking great
on my forehead especially the center
right here whoops that's I just love it
off mm-hmm
this looks pretty think I like it apply
it better with the sponge actually I'm
getting about the same coverage maybe a
tiny bit less with the sponge but the
finish looks very beautiful with the
sponge you still have some left over so
I kind of want to see if this is
buildable with the sponge just on my
acne and stuff down here I don't find
this scent to be overpowering at all I
was kind of worried about how he's gonna
wear this all day with a freakin peach
scent but like I'm not really noticing
it when it's on my face if you like a
soft matte finish but you have some
texture and you like medium coverage
this is going on beautifully this is
something that if I was wearing it on a
regular basis I would spot conceal it's
not covering my acne but it was in again
expecting it to builds beautifully
doesn't look like you're adding anything
else on top my forehead it looks bum and
I love that this like sets down since
this is supposed to be oil controlling
last 14 hours
and it sets down I don't think I'm gonna
powder my face with this one I'm gonna
spot conceal just on my neck down here
cuz I have to go run some errands and
stuff I'm not gonna do it on top of the
foundation so we can see usually I don't
use this a spot conceal but it's okay
I'm just gonna use tart shaped tube down
here and I'm hoping the shade doesn't
oxidize because right now that shade
looks perfect for me like the tone of it
and everything I like this it looks very
smooth and just pretty it's like not
clinging on any of my dryness over here
so check in time we're calling it Oh
exactly 9:30 so I'm gonna do the rest of
my makeup and I'll be right back okay so
it's now 10:10 and I am excited so I
love how it completely sets down it
feels like you're blending product on
top of a powder the way that my bronzer
and highlight and everything went on top
of this it just looks beautiful like I
feel like my face is on like it's not
going anywhere which we'll see how it
holds up throughout the day but that's
how it feels right now and I like that I
still have a little bit of glow coming
through on my forehead it doesn't look
like super flat matte or anything and I
do have a ton of highlight on right
now so keep that in mind but I don't put
that on my forehead at all obviously it
just looks overall beautiful right now
I took a clip in natural lighting so you
guys can see but I have no complaints
really right now I need to take another
whiff of this because I feel like I
didn't talk about scent enough it is
scented for sure like it has a very
sweet almost like fruity scent but it
doesn't smell artificial gross like the
other stuff that I used I actually used
a bunch of the Too Faced peach stuff on
my face today and as I was like
comparing the two it smells
fifty billion times more tolerable it
doesn't like make you dizzy and feel
like you're gonna pass out so I don't
mind this end I'm just hoping that it
doesn't break me out or anything but so
far I am brilliant ooh this I think it's
sitting beautifully on my skin I have no
complaints so we'll see how it wears
throughout the day but on the rest of my
face for contour shade I whipped out my
makeup geek contour this is in the shade
breakup cold porcelain blush I use the
Too Faced pop it on peach blush I
actually really like this I know it has
a major sheen to it so a lot of people
don't like it for that reason but I
think it just looks kind of like
flattering and I like the tone of it and
everything
highlight holy cease you guys this
is a new release from hourglass I think
this is coming out during their holiday
2017 collection I just looked it up
online and it looks like these are three
new shades and a new formula this is the
metallic strobe light palette I was not
that into the original strobing things
but this is stunning
it's like the wet metallic kind of look
it doesn't look glittery it doesn't make
your texture like crazy emphasized or
anything and I actually just kind of
like dipped in all three of these shades
and it worked this is beautiful like I'm
gonna get a lot of use out of this I'm
excited i shadow x' went with the peach
theme I like the actual shadows in here
I've used this in a few different videos
you can just search anytime if you ever
want to know if I've used a product in a
video in youtube you can just search the
Tayla in the name of the product and
since I list everything in the
description box that video should pop up
I do have a couple videos using this I
like the eye shadows the scent is just
then for lips I use this liner which
I've been obsessed with this is the
L'Oreal color riche matte in mastermind
and I topped it off with the BH
Cosmetics liquid lipstick in the shade
Andie so I think that's everything
checking time again is 9:30 I'll see you
guys in a few hours and natural lighting
okay so right now it's 225 so it's been
on for almost 5 hours I have been so
productive feels so good doing laundry
hence that so I think my forehead looks
bomb my forehead looks like flawless
right now for me the rest of my face
looks really nice too the only thing I'm
noticing is I'm getting a tiny bit of
like heaviness on my upper lip heaviness
heaviness on my upper lip doesn't look
too intense or anything but just a
little bit like a tiny bit of creasing
starting I love the finish of this I
feel like it has gotten a little bit
more satin throughout the day it's more
of like a satin matte finish now it
feels nice on my face like I don't know
what it is about this but I feel like
it's not gonna move but it doesn't feel
heavy I don't have to worry about my
foundation like sliding off my face or
anything and oh that's not transferring
wait this never happens with me that's
like not that literally never happens
with me if you have issues with your
foundation transferring this literally
nothing is coming off on my hand like
that is very rare transfer resistant
didn't say that I think that was one of
the claims actually and it's actually
true
I feel like usually what Phoenicians say
that I'm like okay whatever it'll end up
all over my sweatshirt right here and
all over my hand but this is legit
transfer proof I'm amazed okay I think I
need to film a second video right now I
might do the Tryon fall haul I'm trying
to pre-record for London since I leave
in like three days I might totally
change the hair and lipstick and attempt
to film a second video so when I see you
guys at the end of the night I might
look really different okay so it's 7:30
so it's been on for 10 hours by now I
filmed a second video I'm having the
most productive Sunday ever known to
videos got three edited did laundry
Delta make the bed I was just staring at
my skin in this mirror right here and I
don't know why I'm looking more blue I
do in real life it looks frickin
flawless I'm gonna zoom in for being on
for 10 hours with no powder ignore the
lipstick I was just eating and my dick
is coming through over here but look at
my forehead like this is after 10 hours
it's not breaking down at all I'm not
overly oily or anything around my nose
looks really nice there's no major upper
lip creasing obviously my acne is
showing through this isn't full coverage
but just how it looks on my skin I mean
it held up amazing I gotta get real up
in here to show you guys this because
I'm just shocked like you guys know what
my skin can look like after ten hours
and this is pretty amazed all's for me I
love the fact that this is actually
transfer resistant like you can touch
your face and there's literally nothing
coming off that's lipstick on my hand by
the way I am super pleasantly surprised
with this one I really have no
complaints I don't think this is like
the most moisturizing luminous
foundation so if you have dry skin I'm
not
how this one would go but it hasn't
clung to any of my dry patches where
Foundation can tend to so that's a good
sign oily skin I mean this held up
amazing and I think this one might do
well on more mature skin as well because
it hasn't settled in anywhere it's not
creasing my forehead it looks really
good it's not settling into that one
line I usually get the whole transfer
proof thing is like bumping it up ten
points for me because this is one of
those foundations I feel like you could
hug someone and it wouldn't come off
actually I have to wash this sweatshirt
anyway so let's just do like a little
hug test I've never done this before oh
my god nothing there's nothing on here
and it's still on my face okay so this
is relationship proof I need to get in
one of those but if you're like you know
doing your thing this one I think will
last - thumbs up for me on this one I'm
so pleasantly surprised to this because
I just I don't know I just didn't for
some reason to have high hopes for this
one at all and it's kind of blowing my
mind I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I swear ending even if it's not day 15
at least where you know we can only go
up from the beginning there's still day
15 though so who knows if you're
enjoying this series don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up if you're
