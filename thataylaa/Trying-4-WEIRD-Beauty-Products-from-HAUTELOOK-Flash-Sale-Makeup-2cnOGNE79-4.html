all right so today we are testing out
four kind of interesting different
products from hot look look I just say
hot look make it easy you know it's
really fun it's basically like a flash
sale site they have clothes shoes I get
tons of my shoes on there because they
have small sizes it's owned by Nordstrom
so it's like their flash sale site it's
kind of like Nordstrom Rack but flash
sales I check it literally every single
morning but the four products I'm trying
are all things I've found on different
events that just looked really
intriguing and different so we're gonna
be putting them to the test today I'm
doing a full word test in this video so
you guys can see how it holds up
throughout the whole day I'll put the
link for hot look down below warning it
is addicting I'm pretty sure when you
make your first purchase on there you
get some kind of discount maybe $10 $15
something like that though if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you're new here
you can join the BAE radio family and
subscribe I upload every Monday
Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time
I hope you guys enjoy this video here we
go alright it has taken a year and a
frickin half to sit down and finally be
filming today every time I've sat down
something has come up but here we are I
also to pay my nails literally three
times because I kept burning them today
so a clean face right now the first
product that I'm gonna try out is this
dynamic innovation labs instant eye lift
as soon as I saw the words instant eye
lift it caught my attention this thing
looks fun so I screenshotted the
description of each product when I was
ordering so we can see what it's
supposed to do so this originally was
$650 I want to know if anyone's actually
bought this for $650 I got it for 30 497
all of the times what brands like this
kind of jus is over price and then
always mark it down or always have a
coupon code or something like that
sometimes you're not really ever gonna
pay it $650 it just makes it look like
it's a really big discount so says
instant eye lift gives you the aesthetic
benefits of I left without painful
costly procedure the effects are
immediate so we should be seeing some
kind of difference which is exciting you
can feel it working tight working as
soon as it's applied you can feel it
working why am I keep saying working
working tightening pores firming your
complexion and reducing visible signs of
aging such as running out of breath
wrinkles and fine lines made with vegan
an ingredient known for its tightening
and firming properties it is packed with
nourishing minerals so I actually looked
up the ingredients on this
I am NOT a ingredient connoisseur I just
know as much as Google tells me but I
did look up the ingredients and it looks
like the magnesium aluminium silicate is
the vegan deci it has really large
molecules so it doesn't absorb into the
skin which kind of makes sense for
products like this if it's just gonna
fill in those lines I kind of think of
it as just a product that's gonna sit on
top of your skin and hopefully fill in
some of those lines maybe make concealer
go over a bit easier hide some of the
wrinkles and I'm really curious about
this so I do have some lines under my
eyes my concealer typically creases
right there because I have lines there
so it settles in oh it's like pink oh
okay no I'm wearing some vegan okay I
have a little bit right there so we're
gonna apply this thing it does have
directions how to use it it just says
use ring finger apply to clean skin
gently smooth and tap a thin layer over
facial lines and puffiness under eyes do
not rub keep face expressionless until
dry if white residue is visible smooth
over the area with a damp finger or
moisturizer use us needed so I'm gonna
try not to talk throughout this process
so when it first goes on it feels like a
silicone primer it doesn't feel like
anything super tacky or sticky
feels very soft very silicone II almost
like nothing's going on but then as you
wait about 30 seconds you kind of start
to feel it cool it feels kind of cold
and then you can feel it kind of
tightening so right now it feels to me
like it's totally dry I definitely feel
tightening compared to the other I know
no one else might there's you definitely
feel it it feels like I have something
tight underneath my eye I don't know if
it looks a whole lot different but I'm
really curious how concealer goes on top
of here you don't see any peeling edges
it's very unnoticeable but you can kind
of see the shine a little bit I do feel
like it filled that in a tiny bit
compared to this side I don't know if
there's an immediate major difference do
you guys see a major difference I was
taking about that much has a peach color
to it you kind of have to smooth it on
first just to disperse the product then
I'm gonna Pat it in I'm trying to get
right underneath there so it fills in
that line without like getting it in my
eyeball the Sun I feel like it's taking
a little bit long
to dry down so maybe I put a thicker
layer on you can definitely see the
white residue they're talking about so
it says to just use a damp finger and
smooth it out it still is drying this
one is taking a lot longer it doesn't
feel nearly as tight this side feels
even tighter now I feel like I almost
just had like Botox or something like I
feel like I can't really move my face
definitely is tightening I don't know if
I could wear this the whole day this is
not something that would be comfortable
to wear underneath your makeup the whole
day it's actually pretty uncomfortable
very uncomfortable I don't even know how
to explain this it almost feels like if
someone was like pulling back your eyes
and just like holding it there I am
gonna put concealer on right now because
I want to see how it goes over on top of
this but I think I'm gonna wash my face
off for the rest of the products to do a
wear test with those because I'm already
like getting a headache with this it's
quite unpleasant let's put on some
concealer do my eyes look more lifted I
can't really tell so free concealer over
top I'm using Tarte shaped tape since I
use this most often know how it works
and everything it feels like I'm putting
it on top of plastic or something whoa
feels like it's drying way faster what
the heck dude that just dried so fast on
top of there that one is not looking
good at all you can definitely see the
line where this one ends if you're gonna
be putting makeup on top of this you
would definitely have to use a really
thin layer I think this side went a lot
better this obviously looks insane
because this usually goes on top of
foundation not my bare skin ooh
does not look good I'm gonna zoom in
definitely looks quite creepy even on
this side it just doesn't look any
better than how it looks without the
product underneath it it feels so weird
I really feel like I can't move or talk
I'm gonna go wash off my face and then
we're gonna try out the remainder of the
products alright feel like a whole new
woman I wash moisturize and primed my
face my setting spray is like drying
down right now I swear I still feel it a
little bit though it still feels kind of
tight
the next product that we're gonna be
trying out are these makeup applicators
they're basically sillas bun jizz with
dead flowers in them do you have a whole
video testing out this
sponge probably not gonna be a whole lot
different than that I don't know but
we'll see if these are any better for
two of these it was ten bucks which was
marked down from twenty please don't
ever pay twenty dollars for two pieces
of silicon it says use a small amount of
liquid or cream product and spread the
product before tapping on to your skin
build coverage as needed for a
foundation and be using again the new
NARS radiant foundation I have a thought
Asian Friday video on this so
essentially with these you're supposed
to have to use less product since it's
not absorbing anything into here about
some product on here I'm gonna go ahead
and start tapping like it says spread
and tap the thing that typically I don't
like with these sponges is that you're
essentially just like moving the product
around on your face you usually have to
go in with something else afterwards to
blend it out because there's just no way
that you can totally blend this out I
mean it's spreading the product that's
for sure it's definitely not blended
whatsoever so I'm gonna go ahead and
blend it out with since I need to and
areas that it doesn't blend I still have
some products left over so I'm gonna use
that for this side of my forehead and I
am gonna use the same amount on the
other side to see if we have to use less
product with the sillas Bunge
there's only so much you can do with
this thing so now I'm gonna blend will
see compared to the other side but I do
feel like that actually gave me like a
thicker heavier application I'm gonna
squirt out the exact same amount and see
how far it goes with the brush brush
side versus the silicone applicator side
I definitely feel like the brush side it
looks more natural it looks less heavy
but I also got less coverage and I do
feel like the brush soaked up more than
the side that was applied with this and
then blend it out with a brush got
fuller coverage on the sills but inside
I'm just calling it this little sponge
even though this isn't technically good
sales but you know what I mean I still
don't know if I would apply it with this
first it just there's something about
this that it just seems like a pain in
the butt to me to do this and then blend
it out with something else
but if you really want to conserve your
foundation and you're someone who
doesn't mind going in with this step
first I feel like this I did do more
with the same amount of product would
you need this exact one from hot look
with a flower inside probably
not I think this is just for the
aesthetic it is really tempting to like
pop this though and get the flower out
so next project involves my eyebrows so
I'm gonna do my whole face except my
brows and then I'll be right back
alright so the next product is an
eyebrow product but it's not a pencil
it's not a gel it's something that I've
actually I don't think I've ever tried
one of these before it's an eyebrow
sealer looks like a nail polish this is
by blend mineral cosmetics this was
originally $22 I got it for 997 it says
the pro eyebrow sealer is designed to
hold color in your brow pencil or shadow
if you're looking for a thicker more
full brow and are looking to lock in
that color this will do the trick
so apparently it's supposed to make your
brows look a little bit more thick too
so obviously having my brows on I use
the hourglass arch brow pencil in the
shade dark Burnett I've been obsessed
with this thing so we're gonna seal
these guys in I'm debating doing one
brow with it and one brow without but I
think I want to do both of them and then
at the end of the night do kind of like
a rub hug test kind of thing on myself
hug myself to see if my brows move
around at all I don't usually have
issues with my brow products lighting
off my face or anything maybe we'll even
see if this is waterproof at the end of
the night because that could be
something cool if you could make your
brows stay on when you're like going to
the pool or going to the beach if you're
that kind of gal that's honestly one of
the nicest things about having micro
bladed brows as they you have to worry
about that I'm assuming you just kind of
paint this on that is weird
whoa you can see it going on looks very
shiny so I'm hoping this like dries down
Matt I'm gonna kind of comb the ones up
in the front a little bit and see if it
locks them in they're definitely really
shiny I get the fullness thing it's
making my brow hair is kind of century
to look at compared to the other side
you can definitely see the actual hairs
more this feels like a thin wet formula
if I'm just is like you're putting a top
coat on your eyebrows you'd think it
would almost paint the hairs down but
somehow it doesn't it is kind of
accentuating the actual hairs which if
you like a fuller kind of natural brow
even if you don't put anything on your
brows if you're someone who likes a
really full fluffy brow you might like
something like this just to keep them in
place but kind
bringing the hairs out somehow at the
same time it's weird I don't know what's
happening I'm gonna give that a few
minutes cuz it does still feel wet I'll
see how long it takes to totally dry
down right now it's 253 so this last
product is a lip ink this is the
peripera I think is brand peripera
peri's ink that's a lot of Paris really
cute packaging I think this is a Korean
product hence the writing at the top I
got the shade number three it looks like
an orange
I'm hoping this is more of like a more
enjoy lip in was originally $14 and I
got it for 997 so just about four
dollars off Oh cute bottle formulated
with high pigmentation lipping saturates
your lips with super rich color soft
touch without feeling heavy supposed to
be super long-lasting rich color lasts a
long time even after eating and drinking
it says say goodbye to sleepless nights
of worrying about showing a bare face
while traveling so I mean I guess you
could would you want to sleep in this
and I'm about to eat lunch and then we
still have dinner I mean a really late
lunch today this whole day is just one
of those days where I feel like I've
been doing 50,000 things but not
actually getting anything done that I
need you to get done you know when that
happens by the way the makeup on the
rest of my face I used will be linked
down below in the description box Oh
cute for some reason I thought it was
gonna be like I draw it looks like a
little dropper I thought it was gonna
have to like tap it on I like that they
have an applicator on it Oh what does it
smell like
oh it smells like those scented markers
as a kid oh wow that is very bright
looks like the outside of the tube can
already feel drying down this is super
pigmented I was picturing more of like a
lip tint kind of thing I mean it's a
really pretty color definitely doesn't
feel like moisturizing feels very thin
just feels kind of like a lip tint
typically does so let's do a little
eyebrow check it's now 259 so spins what
time was it 253 it's been six minutes
they look less shiny I can still see a
little bit of a shine I wouldn't say
they feel obnoxiously crunchy they do
feel a little bit hard but just to the
point where it feels like they're in
place like they're not really gonna
budge the brow hairs I don't feel like
it feels uncomfortable it feels like
this is totally dried down so I'm gonna
do a little
test I got a tiny bit transferred but
only where it looked like there's a
little line that didn't totally dry down
right there yeah other than that
nothing's coming off
so as we're all four of the holic
products right now it's three o'clock so
that's when we're calling the check-in
time I need to change my background you
guys can't even see that so we're gonna
see how the lipping does through a
couple meals and then the blend eyebrow
sealer all right so it is now 1103 I
changed my phone background so you guys
can see the time so it's been on for
eight hours now I'm like half asleep
right now I just finished working so I'm
kind of shocked by this lip thing it
wore off it stayed through my first meal
and then right as I started eating
dinner I looked in the mirror and it was
like totally or not on the center so I
definitely wouldn't call this
long-lasting I have regular lipsticks
that I feel like last better that's kind
of expecting it to like be a true stain
that's not the case so I definitely pass
on that the brows are looking good they
don't feel crunchy uncomfortable and
they've stayed in place let's let's do a
little hug let's hug it out
I'm just gonna hug myself over here how
does one normally get a hug you know and
like someone hugs you that's way taller
than you okay every hug of my life and
your face just fits all over the shirt
okay I'm gonna really give this a rub
I'm really rubbin okay my foundation
rubbed off a little bit but my brow is
totally still on and I won't see
anything on my hand either okay that one
definitely looks a little bit more
rubbed off than this brow I do feel like
it's helping it stay a little bit let's
go get some water on my face
mm-hmm I'm not entirely looking forward
to this right now but here we go
nothing like some cold water at below
I guess I can make this warm I'm gonna
like torturing myself probably can't
hear me this is a great water test I
mean my face is definitely wet and I
still have some brow on I do really gets
rubbed off a little bit at this point I
am having trouble four million thoughts
a little own analyzing a brow a sealer
should have been so the things we put on
the internet so I feel like the eyebrow
sealer helps is it like totally
foolproof everything probably not but I
do think it lasts a little bit longer
rather than just having the pencil on
through those two things
yes I'd pass on the eye injection I feel
our thing definitely would pass on that
entirely bad idea and this little sponge
thing kind of surprised me it almost
makes you want to give it another shot
because I really didn't like it the
first time I he's just a little sponge I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
gonna wash my face and get into bed if
you did make sure to give it a thumbs up
