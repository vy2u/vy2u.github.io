of foundation I have to check every time
now to see what day it actually is if
you're new here this is where we're
trying out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days I've done nine reviews
so far today is day 10 I'm going to like
the 15 days of foundation playlist down
below that's where you can go through
and watch all of them and I would
recommend starting from day one because
I explain a lot about the series and day
one I'm going to be writing these 115 at
the end of the series so you can see my
overall thoughts what I thought of each
foundation and how I rank them all today
we're doing a drugstore foundation this
is the Ulta color correcting foundation
and primer stick I haven't seen any
reviews on this before I randomly picked
this up at Ulta probably like six months
ago side the shade fair porcelain which
is the lightest shade there are only
eight shades in this foundation which
obviously is not the best shade swatch
times so here's the old to stick
foundation one over is the golden rose
stick foundation this is Tarte
rainforest of the sea and all these are
in the lightest shade by the way this is
Lancome teint Idole ultra this is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless 110
and this is Mac NW 10 this retails for
1250 right now Ulta products are buy one
get one free online not sure about in
store but right now it's by I'm going
free online whenever I order on Ulta or
anywhere really I always use eBay this
isn't sponsored by EVs I just love them
and they always have 350 coupon on eBay
so you probably get buy one get one free
and then get an additional 350 off but
anyways traps I use them much okay
let's read some of the claims on here it
says it's a weightless gel based
foundation stick with built in color
correcting core so it does have this
like Green Center which I'll show you up
close when we do the demo it says
delicately textured formula blends
easily for natural buildable coverage
that helps to even out skin tone the
Green Center is both to neutralize the
redness
outer portion was supposed to smooth and
perfect skin so that's all pretty much
says it got really good reviews on Alta
looks like it has four and a half stars
and there's almost 500 reviews so that's
promising this is the third foundation
stick I've tried in this series we also
did the cover
Foundation on day two I think and the
Golden Rose stick foundation was two
days ago on day eight so let's just get
into it if you guys liked this series
and are excited about 15 days of
foundation make sure you give this video
a thumbs up share with your friends
do your thing if you want to see how
this foundation applies and wear
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching let us click
back buyers today is one those days
where I feel like I just need coffee
and an IV drip right now alright so my
skin is not too bad right now
no major active breakouts except this
one right here this is all mostly
scarring so when you have cystic acne
with combination skin so I usually get
oily a little bit on my t-zone I have
the Real Techniques makeup sponge right
here and a brush this is the elf brush
never remember the name because they
don't print it on here but I'll link
both of them down below this is one of
my favorite brushes to apply a stick and
cream products so when I try it with
this foundation and I haven't used this
at all yet i think i've swatched it one
time a long time ago when I first got it
I've had this for forever if you guys
follow me on Instagram I think I
mentioned like probably over six months
ago asked you guys if you want to see a
review on this you're not doing it so as
you can see it has this Green Center
which is supposed to be for color
correcting some of the redness and then
the foundation product is surrounding it
I have on my light over there today
oh no feel like it makes it look a
little bit more warm that's going to use
a sponge or your fingertips to blend
this out I usually like to use my
fingers to blend out products on my face
so I'm just going to use the brush in
the sponge let's go on O glide it on
really easily I can definitely see like
some of the green coming through so
let's use the brush on this side of my
face there's the tapping
it's blending up super easily and it's
sitting really nice on the skin it
almost looks like I'm not wearing
anything feel like I can see the green
tint is that just me being mental
covered pretty well on the cheek area
actually it looks super smooth do
someone beating forehead
I've only moisturized my face since this
does say it's supposed to prime to I
didn't put a primer on my face all right
so that blends out really nicely with
the brush but about a medium coverage
but for some reason it looks more
flawless than medium coverage usually
does you can still see some my
imperfections peeking through but I
still feel like it looks really nice and
smooth and it covered really well
actually so now I'm going to go in on
this side and use the sponge
do you see how quick that slim get up
okay so that took all of about five
seconds to blend out on my cheek alright
so just with one layer so far I'd like
it sitting really well on my skin it
kind of just like melted into my skin
looks like a dewy finish but it is
already starting to set
I probably blend bronze over this right
now really like how it just effort ly
blended out and I don't really feel like
I need more coverage right now I might
just try and dab a tiny bit on areas
that I need a little bit more concealing
and see if we can build it up and as far
as sponge versus brush I think they both
applied totally fine and got the same
kind of coverage so builds fine I don't
feel like about a ton more coverage out
of that but it definitely doesn't look
cakey or anything wouldn't try and build
it so let's show you guys a close-up I
just feel like it looks really nice and
smooth it's covering everything but it
still doesn't look like a mask on my
face I really like how it's sitting on
my foreheads not clinging on to anything
I'm not sure if I'm gonna set my face
today I really like the finish of it
right now I might put a tiny bit of
powder just in my t-zone so I'm gonna
apply the rest my makeup and I'll be
right back okay so it's now 8:20 in the
morning the rest of my makeup is on and
powder products did blend a little bit
funky on top of this even like a setting
powder which I ended up having to use so
I tried to go in with just bronzer on my
whole face cheekbones and forehead and
it was looking really funky on my
forehead so then I went in with a tiny
bit of setting powder ease the a
cosmetic celebration foundation
elimination now it looks totally fine
and all blended but I do feel like it
looks a little bit weird where my blush
blended out hang on how this last out
the day I could see this being a good
foundation for like the beach or the
pool if you're someone who likes to wear
makeup to those places which I do
because I like to cover my acne but
still look like I have skin on my face I
do really like the way it's sitting on
my skin looks super natural and just
like skin cut looks like
tinted moisturizer on or something it
doesn't look bad like where the powder
blundetto gel it just wasn't as easy as
it sometimes is to blend powder out on
top and on my lips is Too Faced melted
matte in cool-girl mixed with anastasia
beverly hills milkshake so I guess it's
8:20 we're getting an early start today
have a ton of work to catch up on
and I am going back in today to have
this long fix each dungeons a senior
colorist is going to fix them because
the other girl told her manager that she
wasn't confident in fixing the color
which like why would you even sign up to
do it in the first place anyways so
that'll be at 3 o'clock today and then
I'm just going to work so I will check
back throughout the day ok so it's now
540 - whoops now 542 p.m. and thunder
you sit on for over nine hours now I
just had a very interesting day went
back to the salon and have them fix the
extensions I'm not going to get into it
on here because I've posted the entire
rant slash story on snapchat it's the
tale of snaps probably going to include
more information about what happened
with the extensions and stuff in my
second hair transformation video black
to silver so as far as the foundation I
was basically trekking in like 85 degree
heat and I was like slightly sweating
and considering I feel like it held up
fairly well I'm definitely very oily
looking right now I feel like I haven't
looked this oily at the end of the day
from any of the other foundations so far
though I think that this one needs a
really good mattifying powder on top of
it which is a little bit unfortunate
because it does look so nice when you
first apply it without a powder but at
least in the t-zone area this one
definitely needs a mattifying powder on
my skin if you have dry skin this might
be great for you if your oily than I am
probably not the foundation for you it's
breaking down a little bit around my
nose I would just say the main issues
are I look for the oily I don't know
what the heck is going on with my
concealer today I use the Catrice liquid
camouflage concealer this didn't happen
the first time we did the first
impression on it but I'm like super
Creasy and my mascara transferred I
didn't
use any different mascara than I usually
do on the bottom lashes ignore the under
eyes so they're not looking cute right
now I do feel like it oxidized a tiny
bit under this lighting it does look
like it oxidizes not look way too dark
or anything but it's just not as light
as it was this morning so I'm going to
show you guys a clip right now in
natural lighting so you can see kind of
the difference under the ring lights
versus just in natural lighting okay so
here's what my face looks like in
natural lighting right now god it looks
so much less shining and natural
lighting so don't have a mirror now so
I'm just looking at myself in the
viewfinder but feeling before it does
look like it oxidizes a little bit but
it's nothing horrible it's not like
orange or anything it's totally still
wearable yeah there's a little thing I
still really like the way that this went
on I feel like it blended out really
effortlessly I got a lot better coverage
than I was expecting and when you want a
really quick cheap application part of
my issue with the makeup rubber stick
foundation is I usually use that
foundation when I'm just like running
out the door and I need to cover my acne
really quick or I need to just like
blend out something on my face and it
seems like a waste of money to me
because if ammonia happened on for a few
hours that product isn't cheap and I
feel like this could be a good cheap
alternative where if you're literally
just like running to the grocery store
or going to the beach or whatever it is
and you don't want to like waste a good
foundation this one is really quick and
easy to throw on and I think it looks
great when you first apply it and for
the first like 5 hours I was out all day
working at a coffee shop and then went
to the salon and I did look at my face
at about the five hour point and it
still looked a lot better at the 5 hour
point so this could have just come from
like sweating and being really hot
outside I don't think I would wear this
as a like morning tonight all day long
wear foundation this would probably just
be for me something that I throw on when
I want to just go run errands super
quick and like don't want to think about
what foundation I'm paying on my face
and just goes on super quick and
effortlessly so overall I do think it's
worth giving this one a go if you have
dry skin or if you have a good
mattifying setting powder
that you can use on top of this if
you're slightly oilier like I am if for
being a drugstore product I think it's
worth a go if you don't like it keep
your old receipt you can only turn it
but I'm going to be keeping this one and
definitely wearing it again and I think
if you pull up some Rimmel stay matte
pressed powder on top this would
probably be looking good for a lot
longer
oh and I did change my lip color right
now I have on the Kylie tan DK I'm
probably going to be doing a full review
on these let me know if you guys would
want to do that down below I've just
been like slowly ordering shades as they
come back in stock let me know if you
