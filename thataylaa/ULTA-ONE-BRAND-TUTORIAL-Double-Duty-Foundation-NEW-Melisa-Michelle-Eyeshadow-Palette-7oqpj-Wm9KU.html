sprayed my foot
all right so today we are doing a one
brand look using all products from Ulta
a couple weeks ago one of you guys on
Twitter Samantha Garrett recommended
that I do a full phase switching the
Ulta in house products and a bunch of
you guys favorited that tweet and said
that you wanted to see it so here we are
this video is kind of like full circle
for me because ulties in-house brand was
kind of one of the first brands that
really got me into makeup I remember
only owning like two or three of the
Ulta single eyeshadows I had like a
copper one that I used every day
obviously Ulta has extended their line a
 ton since then they have tons of
products now whenever i buy Ulta brand
products I only buy them on sale because
alta by two get one free or buy three
get three free whatever it is they're
really good sales I always stack it with
their 350 dollar off coupon online and I
use Ebates so I get cash back and use
the coupon this video is not sponsored
by eBay store Ulta but I do use eBay's
anytime I shop online I'll leave a link
for down below if you're not on that
train yet I'm like about tap out really
need to eat right now but I hope you
guys enjoy this video if you do while
you're watching it don't forget to give
it a thumbs up if you want to see what I
think of Ulta brand products and how I
got this look in the right place just
keep watching deb new headbands is
exciting
so to prime my face I'm gonna use the
Ulta Matt prime so those of you who've
been watching my videos for a while I
used to always use this primer it was
kind of like my go-to one for a while
it doesn't keep me mad at all such as a
nice silicone primer this one actually
doesn't break me out which i think is
why i used it for so long
fair warning I'm a little bit out of it
right now because I took a migraine and
Naja pill this morning that totally
knocks me out and I'm still feeling like
The Drowsy medication so if I seem
half-asleep I am alright I'm super
excited to try foundation this is the
ultd double duty primer and Sandy OH
apparently this has like primer built
into it in the shade classic I read the
lightest shade a little bit of self
tanner left over you guys are seeing
these videos pre-recorded but I filmed
all of them within like the span of a
week looks country you guys tweeted me
saying to try out this foundation this
video it says it's medium to full
coverage combined silicone and soft
focus
complex smooth mattify provide lasting
coverage squeezing it out on the back of
this palette it is super freaking sick
super thick it's not going anywhere
we've had a few different sponge options
to try to end up picking up this one I
already dampened it and it feels really
nice and squishy it did get
it bigger when I dampened it so that's
from same thing I'm gonna try a sponge
first on this side of my face and we're
gonna go in with brush on this side with
foundation looks like a mousse like
picking up kind of weird on the sponge
great sound should I take this off
probably this foundation with this
sponge I can tell off the bat is a
definite no I think this is a foundation
you need to use with the brush since it
is super thick and moosie so I'm
actually going to use my Sigma f80 for
this one and try it out wow this is
friggin sick it's not one of those
foundations that like glides over your
skin it feels very thick a shade I think
would match my normal skin perfectly
right now it's a little bit light with
the tanner on I'm going to kind of warm
some of this up with my finger first and
then put on my skin and blend out smells
like rose bathroom spray I'm not loving
the way that this is applying so thick
and it doesn't really feel like it's
blending out and it says especially
medium to full coverage I'm using a very
decent amount of product and I would say
I'm getting barely medium coverage I
mean my ask me over here isn't covered
at all I'm gonna have to try out that
sponge with different foundations
because with this foundation it's a
definite no feels pretty dry going on if
you have dry skin this one I would say
is not for you okay
I'm not liking how this is sitting on my
skin at all I'm going to take a little
bit left over on my finger and just see
if I can cover up some of this acne that
just like took away the coverage on my
skin
this looks pretty awful I would not wear
this outside I'd rather wear no
foundation so I did get a concealer from
them I'm going to use this I think to
try and spot conceal - it says it's a
full coverage liquid concealer
waterproof this is in the shade light
cool this is the lightest shade I'm
going to use this for underneath my eyes
but I also want to try and cover up some
this acne with it because concealer
looks pretty dark Tran oh yeah this is
definitely darker than my foundation
right now but that's okay I can lighten
up my under eyes with powder ooh this
feels really nice gliding on I'm gonna
try and use the sponge for the concealer
I usually don't like using sponges I
feel like it takes away some of the
coverage underneath my eyes I'll use the
brush on this side and we can compare
all the products I use and brushes are
always listed down below in the
description box I don't know if I would
call that full coverage I can still see
darkness and for
and stuff coming through I definitely
get better coverage with the BH Studio
Pro or Tarte shape tape so cheating tiny
bit set my under eyes I'm using my
normal Physicians Formula powders I'm
going to mix these two shades I don't
have an Ulta brand under eye setting
powder and my under eyes are so
particular with powder that I usually
just stick to these forgot I was going
to spot conceal using this concealer too
so let's go back into spot conceal /
just like put this all over my face
because the foundation didn't cover
anything okay I think I like that
concealer much better as a spot
concealer covering my acne really well
sponge feels a little bit hard it's not
quite as bouncy as like the Real
Techniques sponge or as my more fluent I
usually use clay I think this concealer
would have done a better job at
foundation than the foundation did
because it's sitting nice on my skin
can't remember why didn't get a face
setting powder I think I was thinking or
just going to use the foundation and not
set my face but since my face shade is a
little bit light right now I do need to
make it even to my neck so I'm just
going to use a powder and I'll be right
back I feel like I've been using these
 ton recently in videos but I've
pretty much been using this powder every
day because I have like ten shades of it
so it's just good when I'm fluctuating
with self-tanner this is the Maybelline
fit me powder in the shade 20 that's
what I used to set my face I'm really
curious about this little pencil this
thing so cute look up freakin tiniest
Ulta ultra slim brow pencil in dark
brown eye so finally restocked my Ulta
brow tint and deep this is my Holy Grail
brow gel I've used this for years now
I've been pretty much out of it for like
six months and just haven't picked up
another one so finally picked up another
one I'm going to use these two products
I haven't tried this one yet though
there's a little spoolie on one end
which is nice feels like more of a stiff
pencil which I like because then you can
just work with it a little bit more you
can just looks a little bit more natural
and carve out my brows for concealer
afterwards so if they look a little wild
right now don't worry it'll come
together so I'm going to be filming a
shadow and schmooze and just catching
guys up on life and what's been going on
I feel like I have a lot to talk to you
about I was going to film that today but
since I feel kind of out of it I decided
to hold off on that one so let me know
if you have any topics or questions or
anything you want me to talk about in
the next shadow inch mousse this brow
gel is awesome for just wearing on its
own - I love the tiny little applicator
you can get it where you want it's not
like going to go over your face like the
Maybelline one has a nice color to it
and it keeps your hairs in place -
without being like crispy
you to carve them out I'm going to try
out that same Ulta concealer okay
browser on I'm having one of those days
where this but I was just like doing its
own thing has its own plan in life I
think the pencil works fine I'm not in
love with it I do like my benefit
precisely my brow better so moving on to
eyes I'm going to use the same concealer
prime my eyes concealer does feel really
nice and creamy like it has a nice
consistency to it I feel like it just
didn't gives me the kind of look and
coverage that I like for underneath my
eyes but I would use it again as a spot
concealer and I like how it's covering
everything on my eyelids right now okay
so this thing is what I am most excited
to try out this is a collab with Melissa
Michelle and Ulta if you don't know
Melissa Michelle there she is she's
actually one of the first people I ever
watched on YouTube like years ago she
just seems like such a sweet person her
kids are adorable on the back here tells
you what you get you get a highlighter
trio blush 5 matte eyeshadows for
metallic eyeshadows and a liquid
lipstick which is awesome so here's what
it looks like on the inside I love that
this is heart-shaped look at this copper
shade I'm so excited to dig into that
and here's the highlighter tree so start
out I'm gonna go on with the shade
rosemary right here which just looks
like a nice cool toned kind of crease
shade I haven't used Ulta brand
eyeshadows in years I feel like I don't
really have any preconceived ideas about
the formula or anything like that look
at this pizza lip gloss is sitting here
from the Claire's video I just filmed
yesterday that video will be up before
this one now I'm craving pizza kind of
one do like a super smoked out look
today I want to go with the shake it
Harley right here which is the deep
brown shade that brown shade is blending
out easily but it doesn't seem to be
super super pigmented and have to build
that one up a little bit okay why is
this one applying the way better on this
side of my face the shake and clean
blending brush and blending out those
edges I feel like I can't not use this
shade because I mean look at it this is
the shade Teresita and it's just like
super sparkly copper kind of colors
looks like it's going to have a lot of
Fallout but when you put it on your hand
it almost has like a wet kind of formula
whoa look at holy look at that gold
this is like a foiled eyeshadow right
here are you guys seeing that that is
beautiful I didn't apply this wet at all
this is just with my finger I feel like
if I want this it would be friggin
insane I want to try that I'm gonna try
this
holy cease I actually think you
could do this wet or dry get like a
similar effect to needs to make a pallet
with the gist this formula alright that
shade I'm in love with I think we get
the point that one is beautiful I'm
going to take the shade Bingbing which
is this like red toned one and put that
a little bit into the crease like this
brown shade in the outer third is not
really doing it for me it looks a little
bit muddy I think I'm going to try and
actually add a little bit of Elana which
is this like dark purple shade and see
what happens
so I'm going to a black eyeliner on my
waterline this is the Ulta gel eyeliner
in black out I've never tried this I
still have a little glitter on my eyes
from the Claire's video I filmed
yesterday poke myself in the eye ball
that went on totally fine on the
waterline not the blackest black I
definitely prefer the LA girl glide on
gel liner better I'm going to take Alana
which was that purple shade and kind of
just blend that down here I'm going to
go in with that first shade rosemary ooh
Lola looks super pretty ok I'm going to
take Lola for my inner corner and I
think I'm going to wet this sprayed my
foot
that is so freaking pretty wet holy
hell yeah
I feel like this shade Lola would be
gorgeous for like wedding makeup on your
lid I just want to like keep putting
that all over my eyes
okay I'm super happy especially with the
shimmer shades and that palette for brow
bone highlight I think I'm gonna try and
take the lightest shade and a highlight
trio right here that looks like a nice
champagne gold kind of color actually
looks a lighter on my face and it does
in the pan actually might work as a face
highlight I got a separate phase
highlight that I wanna try out I'm going
back into this toilet I think for the
blush and lipstick well let's do a wing
this is the Ulta Micro felt-tip black
liner this feels so freakin light like
this weighs nothing it feels like a
feather it's got really good reviews
they had a couple different eyeliners on
there but I don't know this one was just
calling my name holy this I think
is the tiniest tip I've ever seen in my
life for an eyeliner like this thing is
minuscule
okay that was just super easy to make
that tip so this thing I like that took
like two seconds to get a super quick
easy wing I would definitely try this
out again curious to see how it wears
throughout the day I don't think I'm
going to be doing like a we're testing
throughout this video might have to fill
in a second video today so I don't know
if I can wear this throughout the entire
day but I'll make a little note in the
description box this video since I'll be
wearing this for a few days when this
video goes up so it doesn't have their
own eyelashes yet which is that was kind
of interesting especially like they have
literally everything else so I'm gonna
apply my own lashes and I'll be right
back okay so my lashes are on I use
appeared evil ash is and I also tried
out the huge could Buddha Beauty lash
glue in dark tone spread so far my eyes
don't feel irritated at all and usually
when I put on lashes I kind of feel it a
little bit right away so for contour
this was going to be a total either hit
or miss because I couldn't really tell
online and I couldn't find any swatches
of it but this is the Ulta eyeshadow in
the shade desire and this actually looks
really promising let's kind of like NYX
taupe a little bit I'm going to try this
as a contour shade very cool toned maybe
a tiny bit too purpley but it works I
have no idea how the shade Mahal and the
palette is going to pull on my skintone
so I'm going to try it kind of as like a
bronzer okay so it does look more like a
blush I'm going to switch brushes here
that's kind like a rosy wine color
almost and I like that feel like I need
a little somethin'-somethin still so I'm
going to go to my Ulta blush in the
shade Sun glow mention this blush a lot
I love this one this one I can use kind
of as like a bronzer super-excited
because they had a white highlighter on
there this is the brilliant diamond
tilta illuminator it says it has a sheer
radiant finish she houses feels very
like a very light powder almost and it
was what this feels like
it was like I'm not really putting
anything on but it looks pretty it has a
little bit of like a blue tint to it
almost like an icy white I think with a
more cool toned lip this highlighter
would look really pretty I kind of want
to warm it up a little bit this one of
the highly
here I'm going with that lighter shade
there we go it looks like my foundation
kind of just like totally rubbed off on
my nose and I went to put that highlight
on top yeah my nose is looking really
funky and textured right now I don't
think that was a highlighter I
definitely think that's just the
foundation all right I think we're
coming down to the last step which is
lips and setting spray actually want to
do setting spray first I usually do this
before false lashes and everything this
is the matte makeup setting spray my
face definitely doesn't need to be more
matte right now but I do get oily
throughout the day so I want try this
out I want try to sleep with other
foundations and see if it does mattify
freakin intense spray on this I
definitely would switch off the top to
different nozzle because that just came
out very hard smells really good though
it smells like cucumber you can see like
the docks how that sprayed out that was
not a good mister on that thing at all
it was almost like cooling a tiny bit
liquid lipstick in this palette looks
like a color that would be perfect for
this look and right up my alley so I
think I'm going to use that but I also
got this this is the matte lip crayon in
the shade festival yeah I think I'm
gonna use both so first I'm going to go
in with the liquid lipstick so this is
in the shade scandi oh this smells
exactly like the Stila liquid lipstick
mmm smells like cake batter on my
skintone this almost looks like kind of
a rosy brick red color super pretty
that feels super comfortable on the lips
it doesn't feel overly drying or
anything while still drying I'm going to
blend a little bit of festival over top
this is smell smells like those kid
makeup lipsticks has a weird scent these
shapes look pretty similar alright so
everything is on my face I think the
biggest fails for me was the foundation
this is a definite no I'm really excited
to out this eyeliner again it just made
like the easiest wing ever super quickly
for 20 bucks I think that's a great
price for everything you get in here the
shimmer shades in here are gorgeous like
I'm going to continue to use that light
gold champagne kind of color if you guys
