me of easy cheese do we need it do we
just not know that we need it she is it
necessary
all right so today we were trying out a
product that I am so confused by
intrigued by don't know what the heck to
expect by so today's foundation Friday I
usually post foundation video every
single Friday on my channel but last
week's video in this week's video are
clearly not foundation because I'm pre
filming for 15 days of foundation right
now so every single day I've been
filming foundation videos when you guys
are seeing this the announcement video
won't be up yet but it is coming very
soon but what we're gonna be trying out
today is a concealer not just any
concealer this is the new pure
shake-and-bake
powder to cream under-eye concealer let
that sink in for a minute powder to
cream when I first saw this on Twitter I
think I literally read that about 10
times powder to cream I'm very confused
typically I would think that you would
want a concealer to be the opposite go
from cream to powder so you don't have
to set it I don't know why I would want
a concealer to go from powder to cream
but we're gonna try it out they actually
they actually sent this with my face on
a cookie probably one of the more
creative packages I've received I'm not
sure if I can eat my own face but very
cool idea
I would love some foundation down the
neck though I've made that joke on three
different social media platforms now so
looking on the pier cosmetics this only
comes in three shades light/medium and
dark I'm assuming that if this product
is over well they would hopefully be
expanding the shade range but who knows
I have no idea if the shade light is
gonna be light enough for me but we will
see obviously three shades and a
concealers pretty crappy
so this retails for $26 and you get
point one seven ounces of product so I
did a little comparing here heart-shaped
tape we know comes with the ton of
product heart-shaped babe retails for
twenty seven dollars and you get point
three three ounces of product so for a
dollar you get quite a bit more
comparing it to the Urban Decay Naked
skin and these are obviously liquid
concealers so just keep that in mind
this is like ounces versus fluid ounces
Urban Decay Naked skin retails for 29
bucks and you get 0.16 fluid ounces
product so it's actually pretty
expensive very expensive so let's take
this out of the packaging I'm pretty
sure you're supposed to get a little
mini sponge in here Oh yep here's a
little mini sponge that it comes with to
apply oh this looks hella dark for my
skin tone let's just quickly read what
this thing is supposed to do and then
I'm going to put
on my face so it says concealed and set
in one step it's miraculous concealer
melt into the skin to mask imperfections
without the hassle of setting waiting
and baking with additional powder
translucent powder is built into the
innovative formula so the look of dark
circles and blemishes fade away the
result is the smooth and creaseless
finish that lasts for hours and won't
settle into fine lines it's cruelty free
as usual with pure and there's no animal
by-products so all says for application
is that we're supposed to dab a small
amount of our blemishes and under eyes
using the mini blending sponge so here's
the situation with today I've been
filming foundation videos every single
day I leave on a plane in a few hours so
I'm not going to be able to do a wear
test with this one but I have a feeling
that might work out in my favor because
this looks too dark but what I am gonna
do to test this is I'm going to do half
my face with foundation how I would
normally put on concealer under my eyes
I'm gonna do a liquid foundation on half
my face test out the concealer under my
eyes and then on this half of my face
I'm going to test it how I would wear on
more of a natural makeup day so I'm
gonna try and use it to conceal some of
my scarring and also under my eyes
without liquid foundation on underneath
so the packaging you have this twist top
and then you actually get a little kind
of spout which is nice I'm glad it's not
just totally open like a translucent
powder kind of packaging so onto glass
bottle just feels like hard plastic
alright so I'm gonna zoom in get real up
close and we're gonna apply this thing
if you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
new here you can join the baby doe
family and subscribe I upload every
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time here we go I feel like these baby
here just like popped up overnight stay
in your place bro alright should I put
on half my foundation bursts now let's
just do the concealer first on this side
I'm gonna try it with this little sponge
that they give has some interesting
angles going on
they didn't say to dampen the sponge or
anything and it does feel a bit harder
so I have a feeling you're just kind of
supposed to spread it with this so I'm
gonna try it with this sponge since
that's how they recommend to apply it
and then also probably try with my
finger or another brush flavored coffee
always sounds like a good idea don't
know how I feel about it when I'm
drinking it so I guess we're just gonna
do a little probably should get in frame
okay if I can manage to stay in focus
and have this and not fall on my mic
this is gonna be when tap a little bit
out on here no idea how much you're
supposed to use I have about that amount
on there right now
I don't know how this isn't gonna fall
off when I go to turn it feel like this
bun just ate the majority of that whoa
it does feel kind of like it doesn't
feel like a liquid it feels a tiny bit
tacky but not like the liquid that needs
to be said what the heck
it definitely brightened with that
amount but I wouldn't even say I got
light coverage I mean it basically just
like canceled out the redness on my face
I would say off the bat don't like this
fun should play it I'm gonna put some on
my usual concealer brush and try it that
way I'm just gonna shake some out on
here let's try this again you kinda have
to like stick it down first so it
doesn't go flying off okay it's kind of
like sticking I don't know what the heck
this feels like doesn't feel like a
liquid it almost feels like when you go
to blend out powder on top of a like
really sticky base I think because my
face is so red
it's looking like it's light enough but
if you look at my neck it basically
matches my neck so I'm curious to see
how this looks with foundation because
typically with under-eye concealer I
like my concealer about a shade lighter
than my foundation so for light makeup
kind of days with no foundation I feel
like the shade could probably work it's
interesting it doesn't look bad under
there I do have a few lines under here
which I have never found a concealer
that doesn't eventually settle in them
so it's just kind of which one doesn't
make it look dry and crusty and
emphasize the lines so it is settling in
there but I wouldn't say it looks bad
and it doesn't look worse than any kind
of other concealer I put on as far as
settling the coverage is very light you
can see still everything coming through
you can see darkness coming through
right here you can see my freckles right
here I'm gonna first kind of conceal
some of my scarring and things that I
want to conceal with this and then maybe
try and build this up just out of
curiosity to see if I can get more
coverage I feel like you would go
through this hella fast let's just start
down here with some eye scarring okay
don't love how that's sitting on my skin
it's kind of clinging down here I don't
have any major dry patches right now I
am on accutane for those of you who are
new here
but my skin has just been more normal to
dry lately this is where I have a big
scarring spot so let's see if it covers
it up
definitely very light coverage I wanna
see how it looks around my nose area you
can see my pores are pretty large right
there looks okay around the nose area it
doesn't seem to be emphasizing my pores
a whole lot they still look the same to
me I have a lot of scarring stuff down
here so let's try it down my neck yeah
I'm using the crap ton of this I'm gonna
try a different sponge down here this is
a mini Ecotools Ecotools sponge okay so
that virtually covered nada it's kind of
just toning down the problem areas
definitely do not agree with the claim
that it covers blemishes but as you can
see it definitely toned down my redness
this side compared to the no concealer
side I probably wouldn't use this again
on the rest of my face but underneath my
eyes for just a really really subtle
natural kind of brightening effect it
looks pretty good it's not clinging
anywhere underneath my eyes again this
is sheer so it's not gonna give you any
kind of coverage under there I want to
build it up right there to see if I can
cover it a little bit more at this point
though I feel like I'm probably using
like five dollars worth of concealer
just on this half of my face
I see actually a little bit of like
distinction between where it's stopped
and then my face so I'm gonna try and
blend those edges
it doesn't look necessarily bad layered
I just didn't really get a whole lot
more coverage I'm just confused I just
don't know when I would reach for this
over a liquid concealer so let's try it
over foundation on this side so I'm
gonna try it with the CYO long-lasting
lifeproof foundation because this is one
of my current favorite foundations
foundations that was hard to come out I
have a bunch of videos using this this
foundation is six or seven bucks from
Walgreens I haven't seen it in store but
you can get it online and it is friggin
beautiful covers sits on the skin
beautifully smooth everything out
doesn't emphasize dryness or anything so
many of you guys have messaged me saying
you tried this and you loved this
foundation I feel like this is one of
the most underrated products out there
right now I'm just kind of blending it
across the nose so it doesn't look super
funky I do still bring my foundation
underneath and over my eyelids I don't
notice a huge difference when I don't
pull it all the way underneath my eyes
so I just do it
CYO life proof thank you for existing
really curious how this shade is gonna
look on top of this already this is
looking darker than this half of my face
so here we go round two I'm gonna do the
brush because I definitely prefer the
brush over the sponge maybe I should try
my finger I don't know how fingers gonna
blend out powder well that does not look
good I'm all zoomed in I feel like it's
not quite picking up how I'm seeing it
in real life but on top of there it
looks pretty creepy I'm definitely
getting more creases and lines and it
pretty much took away that coverage like
I feel like I actually got more coverage
putting that foundation underneath my
eyes then using this concealer and also
definitely is darker under there than on
my face I would say it's about half a
shade darker than my foundation not
loving how it looks I definitely prefer
how it looks just on more natural look
without foundation because this is just
not working just out of curiosity I'm
gonna put some on my finger now just
kind of Pat this in underneath the eyes
it looks so orange when you put it out
it feels soft and like velvety almost
like a really velvety powder
yeah not loving that oh this I just
looks like a guy like punched in the eye
alright so this is definitely not a
product that I would use on top of
foundation I think this is something
where if you're curious about it and you
like really really sheer concealers and
you just want something kind of more
natural that's not gonna cover anything
maybe just brighten stuff or kind of
even out some redness I do like that
it's not seeming to settle or crease
like this ideas just isn't doing a whole
lot and for 20 what is this 26 bucks
yeah for 26 bucks I would say maybe for
five dollars it would be worth to try it
but for 26 dollars I would probably pass
on this one I will say interesting idea
I think it's cool that they tried
something new and a little bit
innovative I don't think I've ever seen
a product like this come out and I can
only imagine how hard it is to come out
with new product ideas at this point
like I feel like everything's been done
so it is cool that at least this is
something new we haven't really seen
this yet as far as I'm concerned so
personally this one is a no for me if
you've tried this let me know what you
think of it it would be cool to do a
foundation like this like a full
coverage powdered foundation that dried
to this kind of formula pure cosmetics
you guys should get on that I'm also
curious how this would go mixing in with
concealers liquid concealers almost like
the Urban Decay Velvet Iser maybe you
wouldn't have to set that concealer
maybe it would be a total disaster so if
