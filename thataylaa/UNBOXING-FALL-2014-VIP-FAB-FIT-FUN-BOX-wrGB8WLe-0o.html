an unboxing video of a box I've never
tried before this is the VIP fab fit fun
box say that ten times fast if you're
wondering why I haven't really been
glammed up in my last two videos the
only time I've had to film is after work
because I've kind of had a social life
lately I know don't fall off your chairs
so like I said we are going to be
unboxing this guy this thing has over
two hundred twenty five dollars worth of
products in here holy it retails
for 4999 but you can get a ten dollars
off code if you check the downbar I have
never tried 55 fun it is a seasonal
subscription service so if you want to
try one box and you don't want to get
the rest of the seasons you can always
cancel or if you want to be sure to get
on the list to have them and just get
them every season then you can do that
too let's just open this thing up only
downside is that they only ship to u.s.
and Canada so if you live out of us or
canada unfortunately you can't try this
one out why am I using eyebrow trimming
scissors to cut open a cardboard box the
inside looks really cute they have a
bunch of paper items laying on top so
this is the fall 2014 edition obviously
that's what season were in so on the
front they have a kind of a picture of
everything inside the box but I'm not
gonna take a good look at it because I
want it to be a surprise also eating a
tortilla on a watermelon plate because
why not I'm literally about to shave off
my hair right now hmm tortilla my throat
right on top I see dermalogica skin
hydrating booster this is a really nice
brand so I'm already stoked about this I
think dermalogica is pretty expensive
okay so this thing retails for fifty-six
dollars on its own it has hyaluronic
acid which I've heard is really good for
acne so hell yeah this is a ultra
hydrating concentrate that's supposed to
moisturize and minimize fine lines and
all that good stuff comes in this little
like dropper thing sounds super liquidy
aren't you super excited about that then
we have an apron this is by jessie
steele this is a pink and gold polkadot
apron and i'll have something stylish to
cook all of my ramen in I don't do very
much cooking but when I do I will wear
my pink and polka dot apron call me
Martha this is actually really cute I
might gift this because I don't know how
much you so I get out of this no I just
keep it words of a hoarder oh heck you
I'm doing this thing alright this is
like Real Housewives status this is an
intense apron and that apron retails for
$32 next we have this bag looks like
these are handwritten thank you
handwritten handmade thank you notes
that retail for $43 I'm confused whoo
these are cute these look like Instagram
photos is that what they're supposed to
be so apparently this is a wax seal and
they have instructions on how you can
seal it yourself that's actually pretty
legit does this remind anyone else of
those things that used to see in like
history textbooks all right so then we
have a chi product this is already
totally worth it to me just with the
things I've got into bar I feel like
that's totally worth thirty nine dollars
this is the chief 44 Iron Guard actually
need a new thermal protection spray
because I
running out of the one I used she
usually smells really good so let's see
hell yeah smells like G this retails for
1450 and it says that it's supposed to
protect your hair from the heat without
getting that nasty build up stuff that
you can sometimes get from a heat
protectant then we have a sample of new
me organic tea that's what I was
smelling it's an earthy Vanilla's South
African team really need like an extra
desk right here to push it on right so
this is organic non-gmo all of that good
stuff then we have a body butter I have
like some kind of cookie crumbs or
something all over these we have this
body butter this is I'm guessing avocado
scented yes it is it says this one
hundred percent vegan doesn't have
parabens or anything like that in it
well it looks very waxy interesting
smells amazing Wow I have not tried a
body butter like this before super waxy
I'm guessing this is for like your
elbows and stuff doesn't say we're
supposed to put this but i'm guessing
you can put it anywhere actually really
like the feel of this because it doesn't
leave a greasy residue on your hand like
a lot of lotions tend to do that body
butter retails for eighteen dollars by
the way and then we have this beauty for
real lip gloss it has a mirror exactly
like the dryer cosmetic lip glosses
which i think is kind of funny this is
in the shade always there looks like a
really nice rosy red kind of color this
retails for $22 and it's made with
kopaka better a bunch of natural stuff
you tell them all about the natural
stuff Oh way so as I has an LED light
this is like literally exact packaging
of the drug cosmetics where's the LED
like it's mine broken just imagine that
Oh supposed to have an LED like all
right I think my LED light batteries
were not put in yeah not lighting up oh
that looks super pretty though let me
know down below if you guys want to see
this in a shadowing this video then we
have some socks which I'm actually super
stoked about because they have these
rubbery things on the bottom and we have
hardwood floors in our apartment feel
like I need these in my life alright I
guess these are for yoga
isn't really my thing if you want to
know my yoga experiences i have a whole
yoga rant for your viewing pleasure
which i will link over here it looks
like these have straps on the top so you
can do ballet or yoga or whatever your
heart desires in some fancy socks let me
have some interesting random last things
these are some onion crackers their
wheat free and gluten free not about
that gluten free life but if you are
then you might want to try this out I
mean I'm going to try them as free food
then we have honest bar soap the smells
juniper sage and it says that it has
coconut and what else is in luxurious
coconut all of in argan oils in it this
retails for five dollars okay this is
actually kind of cool at first I looked
at this and it was like great going in
the trash but this is the fit fusion and
they give you a free 3 month
subscription it's an online like digital
kind of fitness community the free
fitness video content they have the tone
it up grows on here Jillian Michaels a
bunch of different people and it's free
for three months you can also stream it
from your TV chromecast or Apple TV this
is actually kind of cool that would
require me working out but a girl can
dream alright so that was everything
that was in the fat fit fun box feel
like I have to consciously slow down my
tongue to say that if you enjoy unboxing
videos give this a thumbs up so I know I
have a bunch of other Mimi box unboxing
videos that I'll link down below and all
the information on that fit fun will be
in the downbar if you're curious I will
be having more shadow introduced videos

coming I swear I thought I was going to
have more time to film last weekend and
