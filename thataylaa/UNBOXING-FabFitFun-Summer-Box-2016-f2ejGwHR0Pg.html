sign me up alright so today we're gonna
be unboxing this guy this is a fabfitfun
summer box look at this box for a second
how freaking cute it is box season it's
that time of the year got the gold
scissors let's do this I've done a fact
that fun unboxing before on my channel I
think last year yeah or maybe even two
years ago so you're living in the old
apartment the box struggle is real like
why is this so difficult for me oh here
we go there's a red thing I don't think
I even needed the scissors so if you
have been living under a YouTube Rock
and haven't heard of the fact that fun
bucks yet it's basically a seasonal box
they have like Beauty lifestyle fitness
products all their products are full
size which is nice if you don't like
getting all the tiny little sample
things it's a seasonal box so it comes
out four times a year there's over $200
with the products in each box it retails
for $49.99 but you can use a coupon code
and get it 10 bucks off which I will
link down below alright
I'm excited here's what it looks like on
the inside this is a big box the fabric
phone boxes are usually pretty good so I
have high expectations okay it looks
like this is like a beachy kind of theme
I've seen a ton of the unboxing videos
going up lately but I haven't actually
watched any of them because I want it to
be surprised this is the fact that fun
everyday Beach waves is this their own
brand that's interesting so as you can
apply to wet or dry hair it's time just
like a beachy salt spray it sounds like
conditioning texture and light hold
smells very beachy from what I can see I
don't actually have a card with the
prices on here what is this this is the
stimulation micro during daily body
scrub woo this is probably good if you a
self-tan or anything I don't but if you
do that's probably good it's basically
like an exfoliating body scrub ooh I can
smell their here it smells like mango
lemony super citrusy actually like
citrus smell
summer I'm usually not a fan but I've
been kind of feeling them lately these
are amazing these are vegetables they're
six champagne ice pop molds that is
amazing
so looks like they're popsicle molds in
the shape of champagne bottles these
would be fun to bring for like fourth of
July or something I'm super excited to
try this because who did I hear someone
was just talking about this brand this
is the OC atmosphere protection cream
atmosphere protection cream what does
that mean hunter resent natural
lightweight daily moisturizer sizes an
antioxidant rich moisturizer creating a
barrier on your skin ideal base for
sunscreen and makeup has a really nice
glass bottle feels very classy oh it
smells kind of like the lemongrass or
something very spa-like okay we have a
freaking bag in here looks like this is
a beach bag vitamin C very punny I'm
personally not a big fan of orange but I
will probably give this to someone has
nice candles but my black hair it
probably would have been all about this
and I have weird color things with this
hair color I like have to wear black or
white not than they were colored before
we also have a towel oh this is kind of
exciting this is a microfiber yoga towel
which would actually come in handy I
started doing high yoga and I started I
mean about a gift card for my birthday
and did it with Rach one time and almost
died but this would have come in hand do
you free yoga if you're into that or
even taking this to the towel or
traveling that's probably a really good
travel tell actually because it's rolls
up super shiny this is too good I have
to review this associate each super
absorbent clerical towel features a
mantra to motivate you and keep you
centered if a towel can bring that in my
life
sign me up this is exciting we have a
hell of fresh thing I love these grocery
delivery things I think they're awesome
so this is $35 off your first box heck
yeah
definitely gonna be using that and free
shipping we have a lip gloss here's
passport to beauty this is like a
metallic e lip gloss which metallic lips
are in all of a sudden we gonna come
back this has a vitamin E rich in
hydration and antioxidants right then we
have a couple random samples we have a
blister ooh this is actually going to
come in here
this is a like a protection band-aid for
blisters I always have blisters on one
of my feet no matter what shoes I wear I
think it's because my left foot is
bigger than my right foot provides
optimum cushioning from rubbing and
pressure now we have a couple samples of
the bird speeds
BB cream of course I didn't get the
light shade I got two of the light to
medium shades so not sure if that's
gonna match my skin but I'll definitely
give that to reach for something and
that is everything that's in here so if
you guys want to try out this box I'll
leave all the info that you need to know
down below along with the $10 off code

video right now on the rainforest of the
sea foundation this is the part of the
15 days of foundation serious I think
