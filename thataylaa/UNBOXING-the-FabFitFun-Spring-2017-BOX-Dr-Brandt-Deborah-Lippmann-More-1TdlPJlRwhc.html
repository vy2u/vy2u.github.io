coffee is that a thing
all right so today we are doing an
unboxing video I haven't done an
unboxing video in a hot minute like I
literally think it might have been a
year ago since my last unboxing and it
was probably this box I have been moving
at snail's pace this morning I don't
know what's going on normally I'm like 7
o'clock let's do this so we're going to
be unboxing this guy this is the
fabfitfun box how frickin Q is this
packaging this reminds me of yoga which
I do not partake in so I love the colors
very spring love the pattern I kind of
want to just keep this box to like store
stuff in so this is the fabfitfun spring
box I feel like most people know what
fads and fun is from YouTube and
Instagram and stuff but if you don't I'm
going to tell you what it is right now I
don't subscribe to a whole lot of boxes
I kind of have my few go-to boxes and
I've gotten probably six or seven of
these over the years so I'm faster son
reached out to see if I wanted to
partner on a video and do an unboxing I
was like hell yeah I have a few other
facets on unboxing videos if you want to
see what's been in past boxes or just
have a throwback and watch those videos
I'm willing them down below in the
description box but this is one of the
boxes that I typically like because they
have full-sized products there's
something very unsatisfying to me about
sample size products or like deluxe size
but all the products and facets on boxes
are full-size which is awesome so you
get over $200 worth of stuff for $49.99
I do have a $10 off coupon code for you
guys if you want to use it down below in
the description box along with a link
but these are full-sized products not
just Beauty they have kind of fashion
lifestyle a bunch of different stuff in
here so if you're someone who just wants
to branch out and try different products
it might be a good box for you so
basically with the coupon code teyla
you'll get box for at $39.99 let's unbox
this thing I'm excited these gold
scissors are like the light of my life
I almost slice open my hand multiple
times a day when I open packages with
you woo the inside has the same design
has a magazine that's new so just
glancing and right now I can't see all
of the products but the ones on the top
I'll show you it looks like a very
bohemian kind of springy vibe that is
what it's looking like when you open it
oh I see something from dr. Brandt Oh
someone actually just commented telling
me to try this thing so this is the dr.
Brandt microdermabrasion age defying
exfoliator renew skin radiance polishes
and smoothes helps diminish the look of
fine lines I think the prices are
actually in this magazine
oh cool so they used to put a little
card in with the prices but actually
comes in this magazine now it's like
full details all right this thing
retails for $79 $79 this one dr. Brandt
product is over the cost of the box
basically supposed to leave you with
bright smooth healthy-looking skin some
yet I think the only thing from dr.
Brandt I've tried is the pores no more
primer and then malar you had like their
magnetic masks but I tried when I was at
her house so I haven't really tried a
whole lot from that brand this is the
Brio geo ooh I like that me and that has
a nice ring to it I'm probably seeing it
wrong but in my head it has a nice ring
to it this is the Rose Sarco milk
reparative leave-in conditioning spray
no sulfates no silicones no paraben I
only use sulfate free products on my
hair now because of the color down here
which is fading I'm actually going to
San Diego will be in San Diego and you
guys are seeing this video while I'm
there I'm getting the fusions taken out
and I'm getting tape and put in hard to
see under this light but I do still have
some gray / purple in here but I haven't
touched up that color or put any kind of
color depositing stuff into my hair
since I got it done over two months ago
so I do feel like using it sulfate free
product so it really helps keep the
color in so I'm excited to try this
leave-in conditioner let see how it
smells it smells like something from
back in the day oh my god what does this
smell like remember that L'Oreal spray
that was shaped like a fish it smells
kind of like that like really sweet but
fresh what is this liquid lipstick I see
on here this says I am awesome Bree oh
gee oh by the way of retails for 20
bucks this is a lip kit that retails for
$48 I just painted my nails this morning
and I've already missed a month left in
them number eleven right here
oh it's scissors I like their packaging
black and white going on and these
colors look nice and nude I don't like
in boxes when they put like the random
colors that no one's really going to
wear and this is a really nice it's like
that in kind of nude mom shade comes
with a lip liner a gloss and a liquid
lipstick this kind of has a chemical
scent I love this packaging I'll
probably wear this in a foundation video
if you guys can see how it look there's
Deborah Lippmann in here so there's like
this light bluish grey shade and then
almost a periwinkle flash sky-blue
Deborah Lippmann is not cheap so this
retails for 19 bucks in a little
magazine thing they show a pink one so I
think there's two different sets that
you can get I'm actually really glad I
got this one
I actually have only had my chillax off
for like three weeks so I've been really
into painting my nails lately again the
love shellac but just in kind of bored
of having the same color for like four
weeks this is actually a white that's
weird since this is a blue tinted
packaging blue this is like a baby blue
when you take it out of the packaging
and this is almost a white or maybe it
is totally white I'm into this light
blue shape it's called like a virgin and
then the shade is Blue Orchid then we
have a face mask this is the Karuna
hydrating face mask this is actually a
serum infused cloth masks or like a
sheet mask I'm not usually super into
CMS because I just like to live my life
when I have a face mask on and like walk
around I actually got this thing at
Daiso where you hook it around your ear
basically like attaches your sheet mask
on to your face and you look really
stylish it's a good look so this one
retails for $28 it's a single-use face
mask for $28 as well so this is supposed
to be good for dry dehydrated or dull
skin we shall see vitamins so sad that
I'm excited for vitamins I'll probably
talk about this in a shadow entrance at
some point I've made a lot of health
changes lately for my neck in my
migraines and one of those things has
been taking vitamins I take like five
vitamins a day now which has been a big
shift because before I can even remember
to take one pill a day hair skin and
nails gummy with biotin I have heard
that biotin can break you out sometimes
and you guys know as cystic acne so I
guess I'll try it out and see if it
makes my skin any worse but if you have
any experience with acne and taking
biotin vitamins let me know how it went
for you but these are strawberry
flavored I'll probably want to just eat
this whole package in one sitting so
there's four different little pouches
that you could get and I actually got
the black and white one so this is
perfect and it says slay all day this is
actually a pretty large pouch and I
think this looks like it's waterproof
oh sweet yeah so the inside is totally
waterproof so this could just be a good
beach bag even to stick like your wet
swimsuit in or something if you have to
put it in your purse or back in your
beach bag then we have a boho beach
Roundy so this is kind of a tapestry
that you could bring to the beach or
concert or I'm kind of music festival or
whatever you want I'm not going to do
this because you guys won't be able to
see it anyways but again I think there
were different kind of color schemes
schemes flashing in here is this little
pouch this is from the brand love AJ
okay
these are right of my alley they're
rose-gold like curved earrings ones that
go kind of up your ear this is weird
timing says actually looking on hot look
the other day to try and find ones like
this these retail for 85 bucks whoa and
it's 14k rose gold so this shouldn't
irritate your ears I do have sensitive
ears so some earrings just totally
bother my ears but it actually comes
with a curved one and another set right
here so here's what they look like up
close these are cute it looks like
depending on the box you get you either
get these or you can get a gold kind of
cuffed bracelet so that was everything
in my box
it is now empty you feel like between
the vitamins which I'm really excited
about the dr. Brandt and the deborah
lippmann just what those products this
box was worth it to me for basically 40
bucks with a discount code because that
weld pays for itself it's always fun to
try out a different kind of makeup
brands I've never tried before like this
if you're wanting to try this box for
yourself the link will be in the
description box along with the coupon
code at teyla so I hope you guys like
this video if you did make sure you give
this a thumbs up so I know love you guys
thanks for watching see ya my next video
