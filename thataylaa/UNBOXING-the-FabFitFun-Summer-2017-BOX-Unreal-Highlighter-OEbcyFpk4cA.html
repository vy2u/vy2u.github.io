wine happened it's almost noon not mad
about it
so we're gonna do an unboxing and I
figured might as well have fun with it
this video might actually be going up
first but I'm filming a foundation
Friday video today since I'm going to be
gone in San Francisco the week says this
video goes up I'm pretty sure so I'm pre
filming for this week I don't know why
I'm telling you this
let's just open things so I've partnered
with fabfitfun to show you guys their
summer box so thank you to pop it fun
for supporting me in my life choices
Cheers
did a spring unboxing this is the summer
box in these retail for $49.99 and
you're supposed to get over $200 worth
of products in here if I like because
it's full size products and it's just a
good way to find new brands sometimes I
still use the liquid lipstick from last
season's box he also gave me a $10 off
coupon code for you guys if it's your
first box so leave that down below in
the description box I'm excited
you get a little stylish magazine where
they tell you all the products there's
cute dogs distracting I'm already
feeling that one goose booty booty just
booting so first thing I'm really
excited about is the Juice Beauty
smoothing eye concentrate
juicy is like an organic skin care kind
of brand if you haven't heard of them
organic grape juice and aloe my under
eyes have been having issues lately my
concealer is just getting super crazy
dry under there even though my eyes
don't feel dry I don't know maybe this
will help so here we go all the pricing
is on the first page in here this juice
beauty product usually retails for $29
so there's just the wrong in here so
this can be a scarf or a sarong this is
a Michael Starr's brand I've never
actually worn a sarong but I really like
saying that word it's a great word how
much is this usually oh dang there was a
black and white one woah this usually
retails for 54 bucks then use as a scarf
shawl sarong very versatile Michael
stars thank you
wait is this a highlighter bronzer oh
this is in the shade bronze so this will
probably be too dark for me but let's
undo this thing this is by cargo the
cargo HD picture-perfect highlighter in
fir'aun's and this usually retails for
$30 I haven't tried any highlighters
from cargo I not think some of their
blushes are really good right having
issues opening stuff just going to go
all in oh this actually looks like it
might work this is like more of a peachy
kind of highlight woah that feels
hello soft and it looks very pretty
I'm usually more into white or pink kind
of her
lights but this one could be nice for
the summer Justin SIA this is super
buttery like I won't just keep rubbing
my hand in here
should we add a little wine and
highlighter this is the best day ever
my mirrors a mile away good thing we
have a mirror on here I just realized
right now I just have on the whoo oh
heck yeah do you guys see that so here's
the floor hell yeah that doesn't look
anything like it does in the pan this is
beautiful eyes now I'm talking about
this it has that wet look to it which is
what I love this is a big win for me
I think this dry shampoo was in one of
their past boxes this is the chlorine
dry shampoo with oat milk I can't
remember if I've tried this one or not
yet I think it might still be in my
closet see what this smells like
should probably not spray that into the
coffee slash wine that just shot out I
can't smell I'm afraid on the box it has
a freaking turbo sprayer on it smells
very clean and classy the dry shampoo
retails for $20 it is the passport case
and what is this yeah it is
cool there's a passport case and a
luggage tag in here retails for $28 and
you get two separate things in here it
says on the road again I actually don't
have a passport case so this is perfect
and I'm all about the rose gold there's
a water bottle in here you can never
have enough water bottles this is one of
those glass ones the bkr the only way to
drink water is if it's out of a cute
bottle or little what are these holes
for like a little tumbler thing like
this one it looks like in some of the
boxes they give you a pink one I got the
blue one clearly these are Taylor for
$35 and it's not too heavy this is like
a nice weight or it wouldn't totally
weigh down your bag or anything right so
there's just a couple more things in
here I feel like this is going to be a
really quick video SPF 50 face sunscreen
ultra light hydrating sunscreen lotion
it says this fast absorbing and has a
matte finish I feel like it's hard to
find a face moisturizer with a matte
finish so if this is actually matte that
would be great I also really easily
breakout from face on creams I kinda
want to see if this is actually Matt
feels really lightweight it actually
feels like it's totally absorbing into
my skin has a little bit of tackiness to
it which i don't mind cause i feel like
that helps foundation stick doesn't
necessarily smell good just
like sunscreen oh it's fragrance for you
that's why yeah looks pretty matte
doesn't have any kind of major
luminosity to it so I'm definitely gonna
try that out
not retails for $24 normally and then
the last thing in here is in a bunch of
bubble wrap Oh cute it's a little
necklace look at this packaging what a
cute idea so this is how light and it
says it enhances intuition and promotes
calmness it almost looks like little
white marble this is a good packaging
idea that is everything in my buck I'm
jazzed about this highlighter right now
look at that I should probably go eat I
feel like I just did that really fast
pretty sure this video will be going up
before the foundation Fridays you want
to know my makeup details right now that
will be coming in Friday's video if you
enjoyed this video and are just excited
about life don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up again the link for
Fassett fun along with the $10 off
coupon code off your first box will be
down below in the description box love
