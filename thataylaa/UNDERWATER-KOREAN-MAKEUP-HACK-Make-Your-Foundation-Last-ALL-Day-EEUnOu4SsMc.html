in my apartment
it is Sunday to Friday but instead of a
product review today like normal I
wanted to try out this trend because
it's been going around the interwebs I
believe this thought popular in Korea a
few months ago but it's kind of just now
hitting the US I've seen both PopSugar
Seventeen magazine everyone is posting
about it right now so wanted to give
this a go and see if they actually work
all right
Harry's been back so what we are trying
today is a Korean trend called Jam soo
in Korean the word Jam soo translates to
diving or submerging in water you can
guess what we're going to be doing today
so basically it just as if you're
supposed to put on all your liquid
products your primary foundation
concealer and then we're going to go in
with a super heavy dose of this baby
powder all over the face and then I'm
going to dunk in water and it's supposed
to basically lock in your makeup you're
not supposed to get as oily throughout
the day I do have combination skin I get
pretty oily drugs day so I'm going to do
a full day wear test with this and see
if this friend actually makes me less
oily so let's stop talking and get into
the video if you are new here you can
join the BAE reader family and subscribe
I upload pretty much Monday Wednesday
Fridays every single Friday I normally
do first impression reviews we're
switching it up today you guys are
excited to do this make sure to give it
a thumbs up it's got my eyes coffee to
get me pumped in life right now / ready
to dunk in ice-cold water
so Foundation I'm going to be going in
with today is a Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation I normally mix shade at 10:00
with shade 12 to get kind of my perfect
shade but since we're putting baby
powder on it can light in your face
instead of the pure white powder so I
think I'm just going to go into the
darker shade shade 12 today and hope
that when the baby powder goes on it
lightens it to my actual shades if not
I'll be a little bronze today it's all
good this is one of my favorite
foundations I know how it performs and
how it wears on my skin so I feel like
it'll be a good one to kind of test this
out with I have clean hands and I have
already primed my base
all right so my base liquid products are
on I am going to set my eyes with my
normal start user press powder and then
I'll go in with the baby powder on top
of it just because my under eyes get
super weird and I try and bake or do
anything it just totally takes away all
the coverage and they get really weird
textured under there
so when I actually got to CBS to find
baby powder I've never realized in my
life how many different kinds of baby
powder there are there are about 10
different kinds of baby powder so I
googled whether you want the cornstarch
as its health health is not good to put
on your face and you definitely don't to
be inhaling any kind of help so I went
with cornstarch baby powder I just got
this smaller bottle it comes with four
ounces you know it's about a dollar
fifty so it is super affordable some of
the artists will say that you can
diffuse your loose powder or if you have
a deeper skin tone definitely don't go
in with white baby powder or else you'll
just totally have kind of a white cast
over your face I did some investigating
when I was in CBS and the cornstarch
should be fine to absorb oil just like
the talc baby powder does boot smells
good and I didn't get the one with aloe
or anything in it this is just mild and
gentle hypoallergenic good old baby
powder I'm going to layer this on
and then we're going to go out into my
kitchen where I have my bowl we're going
to dunk and then I'll show you guys and
natural lighting and in studio lighting
what it was like after we do that so I'm
excited but have my next bunch here and
you're supposed to put on like a super
thick layer her yo system tailless from
what I've seen you basically want to
just look completely white covered in
powder feel like a sponge and then quite
picking up the products and one for the
Beauty Blender okay yeah Beauty Blender
picks up a lot more my upper lip right
now is looking really
tones and cakey I'm going to pin back my
bank with a note people are kind of
labelled here we go ready to party ok I
think we are sufficiently powdered some
people say to leave this on for about 5
minutes I would say it's already been on
for about a minute I have time I get out
there and get all the stuff ready to
film it'll probably be a few minutes
let's go down alright we have our bowl
of water here this is ice-cold water I
haven't a year so what you're supposed
to do is submerge in this for 15 to 30
seconds if you have more dry skin they
say supposed to do it for 15 seconds if
you have oily or 30 we're going all-in
I'm going to try and do it for 30 let's
see how this goes
alright so we could use some public
music right now okay okay here we go
tell us one more time second scale was
on record
oh I'm sorry now okay few more later
okay I think that was about 25 seconds
I'm going to tell guys it's awful it's
better than mad
so you're just supposed to pat pat it
off 12 runs like totally milky literally
got my entire whole head wood so looking
in my mirror there are definitely a few
areas where it totally rubbed off like
on my nose I'll show you guys up close
but it's totally rubbed off on my nose
and on my forehead in some parts but my
cheeks look really nice and smooth my
under eyes look really good it doesn't
look super great on the center of my
face but the rest of my face looks
pretty good it looks really nice and
smooth the powder did totally rub off I
don't think it totally lightens my face
a whole lot okay so hopefully you can
see this but right here the foundation
is like totally rubbed off on the side
of my nose man this part on my forehead
is also rubbed off a little bit and
looks pretty textured it feels really
good it feels like I have nothing on my
skin yeah woah feels super soft just got
a really great shower that actually felt
really good and like refreshing but yeah
there are some major issues don't always
my nose I didn't even see this part
outside but right here totally rubbed
off too I might have just not put enough
powder in those areas because my cheeks
and stuff was good so if we're doing a
full day wear test I am going to put on
a little bit in those areas because I
have to go outside I'm going to hope
that this doesn't get super weird
texture clothing over this powder so I
am getting a little bit of drag I guess
like you normally do when you put liquid
on top of powder but nothing horrible I
actually don't think that this powder
lighten my face a whole lot so I
probably could have mixed in my normal
shades like I usually do but now here's
what my skin is looking like once I've
touched up those areas so after you take
your dunk I just have a throwback to
elementary school fundraisers when there
would be
jumping wasn't fun totally thought about
those so I'm going to go ahead and put
on the rest my makeup and I'll be right
back
all right this now 10:38 we're calling
the check-in time 10:30 s and that's
about when I wrapped up my foundation
all the products that used on my face
will be listed down below like always
but holy to use my blush bronzer
highlight blended out so easily so
smooth it literally felt like I was
blending on top of a cloud thing I do
really like about this is that I don't
feel like I'm wearing any makeup my skin
feels so soft nothing is transferring
right now at least I've never had it
feel that smooth and easy to blend so
that's a plus my skin looks really good
right now it looks super smooth and
almost airbrush is this practical for
doing everyday probably not would I do
this everyday
hell no major props to you if you could
I think this actually may work if you
want a kind of waterproof you makeup do
someone who likes to wear foundation to
the beach or the pool whatever in summer
when it's really hot and you're going to
be going underwater this might be a good
trick to do we'll see how this words
throughout the day but depending on how
it folds up you could also do this for
special events because of that I kind of
want to do a flash test right now so I
can see if the baby powder has any kind
of bounce back I'm assuming it will this
one doesn't have help in it but we'll
base let's do this it's actually not
horrible I think under my eyes where my
stargazer powder is have a little bit of
bounce back but it also could just be
because my face is too dark right now so
the flash is making it look actually
even to my skin tone but it doesn't look
horrible I was expecting a major major
white cast yeah doesn't look too bad so
I'm going to keep this on as long as
possible we will see how it builds up
throughout the day
I am surprisingly impressed right now to
be honest I thought this is going to be
kind of one of those hacks gimmicks but
right now it's looking pretty damn good
so check-in time is 10:30 outside back
in with you guys at the end of the night
all right so it is now 858 it's a nine
o'clock so it's been on for over 10
hours ten and a half hours now and I am
shocked for being on for ten and a half
hours to bring on for any amount of time
it looks amazing right now
it still looks super smooth on my cheeks
my forehead it feel super modified
compared to what are you
look like at the end the night with the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
sometimes I do get a little bit kinky
around my nose area and it's time to be
on the center of my forehead and it
still looks a tiny bit textured around
there but nothing even close to what it
normally looks like overall it looks
amazing I'm honestly super surprised at
how good it looks at this point I was
out to dinner with raishin even she said
that it looks like I just got my makeup
and that's what I feel like it looks
like it really does still look super
fresh and smooth and just overall looks
really good okay so up close here is
what the foundation looks like what the
heck look at how smooth it is I mean for
ten and a half hours this is pretty
unreal for me looks bum like I said I
probably wouldn't do this every day it
just seems a little extreme but what I
do think I'm going to try is putting
water into a spray bottle and then maybe
just putting this on like the center of
my forehead my t-zone where I usually
get super oily and just spraying the
water on so it's less of a production
I totally do this for a special event or
if I really needed my makeup to look
absolutely flawless all day obviously
you're going to be doing your hair or
something do it after because you're
going to be Duncan this actually works
really freaking well so if you guys like

sure you give it a a thumbs up if you
