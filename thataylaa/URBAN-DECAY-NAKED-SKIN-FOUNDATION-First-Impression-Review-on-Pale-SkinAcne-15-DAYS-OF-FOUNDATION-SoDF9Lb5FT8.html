of foundation mug of the day it's my new
favorite coffee cup of life if you're
new here coming on the last day this is
where we are trying out a new foundation
every single day for 15 days I'm going
to leave the playlist down below in case
you are just tumbling across this video
or you missed some of the days you can
check the 15 days of foundation playlist
it has all the videos 1 to 15 listed
there you can start from the beginning
first dog super quick before we get into
this video I just want to say a huge
thank you to guys for all of your
support throughout this whole series I
did this just kind of as a challenge for
myself because I love foundation I've
just been overwhelmed with the amount of
positive feedback from you guys and
snaps and tweets and everything so I
just want to say thank you you guys
because at the end of the day when I'm
exhausting and editing at 12:00 a.m.
after everything else reading your
comments has really made it all worth it
to me so thank you guys I love you guys
favorito fam is the best so I am going
to be doing a wrap-up video 15 days of
foundation or talk about my thoughts of
all the Foundation's I tried best and
worst at video won't be up tomorrow
because honestly I need a day to like
chill but I'm going to go through watch
all the 15 days to have like a refresher
give myself a couple days to try a
couple foundations in different ways
with different powders to see if I like
them better at all
I always update you guys on snapchat and
Twitter any kind of details like that so
you can follow me there everything's the
Tayla except snapchat which is the tail
snaps but anyways on to the final day of
15 days of foundation today when we
talking about the Urban Decay Naked Skin
weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup I had you guys on snapchat vote
between this and three other foundations
two other foundations this one won by
literally over double I was surprised
apparently you guys are really curious
about this one so this is the final
foundation in the series obviously it
still bought and I'm going to try out
all the other foundations that I've
shown you guys so that will be coming
this is one of those foundations that I
feel like I don't know why I've never
tried I love the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer it's what I'm wearing today
and I've just never tried the foundation
I think I always thought it would be way
too dark for me by the shade 0.5 this
comes in
26 shades so I'm gonna insert some shade
swatches right here that sentence took
me ten times to say okay swatch time so
right here is the Urban Decay Naked
Foundation in 0.5 this is Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation in l42
our blastic foundation that we did a
review on yesterday in the shade
alabaster this is Mac &amp;amp; W 10 and this is
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
110 it's pretty similar to Mac &amp;amp; W 10
except I feel like it's actually
slightly lighter this retails for $40 on
sephora's website you can also find this
on glambot which I mentioned in my why
sell video but I just love buying
high-end makeup um glam bought it's a
great way to save some money since this
is an older foundation Limbaugh
typically has a bunch of these products
but anyways you can find this on Sephora
as well if you have a hard time finding
foundations for your skin undertone they
have a cool system with this foundation
she's ending a point zero have warm
undertones ending in 0.25 have neutral
undertones and again point 5 have pink
undertones and ending in 0.75 have
golden undertones so hopefully with that
shade system you can find one that works
for you so there wasn't a whole lot of
planes on Sephora's website so I'm on
Urban Decay's website right now we're
going to read what this is supposed to
be all about says coverage without
compromise our weightless formula blurs
imperfections for a flawless finish that
feels invisible but looks professionally
retouched has a buildable coverage
weightless feel and a luminous finish
and it's supposed to look like the
beautiful skin you were born with so
that's pretty much all the claims for
this guy it feels weird that this is the
last day I kind of want to like keep
this going but I also can't kill myself
every day so if you guys liked this
video and have enjoyed the 15 days of
foundation series please give this video
a thumbs up if you want to see how this
foundation applies and where it's
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching
last day folks last day it is Sunday
when I'm filming this and it is 75
degrees outside right now so I'm hoping
that I can make it outside still to edit
yesterday's and today's I think I'm if
I'm half my face with this cover FX
mattifying primer and this is one of my
favorite primaries I've only used it so
far when I've gotten the free samples
from Sephora so any time that this is on
their sample thing I always statute up
it says 1% sell so that's it in it so if
you have acne I feel like this is one of
the only primers that it doesn't break
me out so I'm just going to apply this
to the right side of my face I'm between
yesterday and today these ones actually
have closed up a lot so I use the
L'Oreal black mask that I keep showing
on snapchat I love that
L'Oreal came out with these three new
face masks and the black one is freaking
amazing so I just grabbed the lightest
one regardless of the undertone because
that's typically what I do this is a big
bottle this only has one fluid ounce of
product which is standard for a
foundation but the bottle is pretty
freakin big so online that says to apply
it with their brush or sponge so I'm
just going to do a brush on one side of
the face to sponge on the other since
this is buildable I have a feeling that
a brush will be better but we shall see
so I'm just gonna pump some out on here
get going whoa super liquidy yeah very
liquidy you can start out with my Sigma
f80 to flat top kabuki brush and I'm
just pouncing in here and then just
start
oh alright this is honestly off of one
thing is has better coverage than I was
anticipating thought I was going to have
to like majorly majorly layer this one
has a very like kind of fresh floral
Esat smell sound that blended out super
easily actually got better coverage than
I was expecting the shade looks pretty
good I'm hoping that this one doesn't
oxidize it all so didn't totally cover
up the acne spots up here which is the
one thin layer I feel like it gave nice
coverage overall the one layer right
here looks about a medium coverage to me
so let's try the left side was a sponge
by the way I used about pump and a half
on the side of my face I'm going to do
the same on the sponge eye and I'll see
how far that goes
I really like this side better with the
brush I think we got much better
coverage with the brush so I'm going to
go in for a second layer this foundation
is supposed to be buildable so I'm gonna
go back in with the brush on both sides
and see how much coverage we can get
this side I would totally wear out of
the house just as it unday where I don't
feel like a need totally full coverage I
just want to like you know still see
skin showing through all right second
layer
I did a coconut oil mask on my hair last
night and I feel like coconut oil works
better on my hair then I'll will flex
number three does anyone else feel like
that I don't really notice a difference
after he's old plucks number three even
though I know it's technically like
rebonding the molecules the coconut oil
I actually feel like I can feel my hair
feels softer and it just looks better
I'm liking how this looks it looks like
skin I did just use pretty much that
whole pumps I'm going about off-pump
more for the forehead sitting really
nicely on the forehead you guys know by
now that's like one of my kind of
problem areas I guess you could say my
forehead tends to get really textured
looking for certain foundations and it
just clings on to my dry areas or the
acne spots and it's looking really nice
on the forehead I'm gonna show you guys
a close-up after I do the side of my
face and I do have combination skin with
cystic acne and I usually get it a
little bit oily on my t-zone all right I
actually feel like that covered
everything I have a little bit left on
here so right now it's looking like a
satin kind of Demi matte finish it
definitely looks more satin right after
you apply it but this side is starting
to look more Demi matte as it starts to
dry and set it looks really nice it's
not clinging anywhere really around the
nose area it looked pretty good right
now upper lip looks good why it's
sitting on my face is just very smooth
so here's the forehead it's a nice high
medium coverage I would say you still
see some spots coming through here you
can see some like freckles and stuff but
it looks really nice and smooth and it
still looks like skin because you can
see those things coming through so it's
ten thirty right now I'm going to apply
the rest of my makeup and we'll be right
back I just realized you're supposed to
shake this before whoops I didn't
actually notice any issues with not
shaking it but I guess you are supposed
to shake this before blowing alright so
it's now 11:20 I'm going to call this
check-in time 10:40 because I did a
snapchat makeup tutorial on this look if
you guys want to see how I did it it was
on snapchat says that started 40 minutes
ago so we're going to call it 10:40
because foundations went on this whole
time obviously so I did end up setting
my face with my cover affects
illuminating setting powder that I've
been using a few other of these videos I
just love that sighting powder I did
feel like this foundation needed to be
set this powder on top of it looks like
a really good combo so far I think the
shade looks really nice it doesn't look
powdery at all on top of this foundation
my skin still looks like skin and so far
I'm liking the way that this looks I
think it looks really nice so I'm going
to wear this throughout the day that's
all guys say alright so here's what it
looks like in natural lighting I wish I
could film out here because I feel like
it just makes your makeup look more true
to color there's a little close-up think
the powder definitely modified it a
little bit it's now 343 so the
Foundation's been on for a little over 5
hours and it looks pretty damn good it
looks pretty much the same as when we
first applied it I've been looking at it
in natural lighting and it looks really
nice my only complaint right now is that
it is getting a little bit cakey around
my nose and upper lip area right here
I'm getting some creasing other than
that there's nothing really to report
right now except my right eye won't stop
watering that happen anyone else only my
right eye
waters it looks literally flawless on
the forehead on the cheek area
everywhere else except the nose area so
around here you can see that you can
definitely see the foundation around my
nose area and on my upper lip right here
I'm not sure what's going on right there
but usually don't get a mark right there
usually get like the expression lines
right here so that's literally the only
area I think that doesn't look great
look at my forehead look at my forehead
looks really good for being on for 5
hours already alright so it is now 8:30
p.m.
ignore the hair and this side of my face
beside of my groom for a few hours so
sleeping with a hot pack on this side of
my face hence why this eyeliner like all
over my face but I wanted to film this
final check in for you guys the
Foundation's been on for 10 hours now
did I just say that I think I did but
considering that I was just laying on
the hot thing usually my foundation
fully rubs off and my eye makeup on this
side of my face the foundation looks
pretty damn good
besides my eye makeup if you just looked
at my face I feel like you really
couldn't tell I wasn't lying on this
side at all and this side is completely
still on as far as oil and everything my
skin looks really nice I don't know if
it's just the combo of this foundation
with the powder that I use sometimes
this powder just works really well with
certain Dacian and if you like it makes
my makeup last for forever I don't know
but this combo is good because for me
and my oil my skin looks really nice
right now after 10 hours I decided my
face looks like I just applied it like a
few hours ago
it didn't oxidize which is awesome the
only area that I do not like it's around
my nose area next time I apply this I'll
probably try and put some kind of pore
filling primer around my nose area
sometimes that helps with the clinging
but I do get this a lot with foundation
other than that it looks good but yeah I
like this one I'm trying to think of a
skin type that wouldn't be good for this
and I would say even what dry skin this
one might work for you just don't apply
a setting powder over top oily skin like
I think it did pretty damn well I'm
exciting about this foundation I
definitely want to trying this with
different powders and primers and
setting sprays because I feel like it is
one of those foundations that's kind of
versatile just a finish of it and the
fact that it is buildable I feel like
you can kind of control the coverage
that you want as well is just a hot mess
right now of course this would happen on
the last day so I hope that you guys
enjoy the series I have a little
surprise for you guys but it's going to
be coming in that video so be sure to
look out for that I think that's
everything I feel like I should have
some like big concluding speech but I
don't I'm just like kind of drowsy on
migraine meds right now so love you guys
