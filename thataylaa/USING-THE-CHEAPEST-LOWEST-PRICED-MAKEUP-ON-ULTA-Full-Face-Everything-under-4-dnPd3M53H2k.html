p.m. Pacific time I'm also starting to
do if there's a sponsored video going up
in a certain week I'm gonna try my best
to do a bonus video so you guys had a
bonus vlog yesterday on Tuesday alright
I have my box of Ulta make up here I
kind of forget what I ordered
so before sitting down to film this I
went back on Ulta and I know
that things do change based on the
pricing obviously what's the cheapest so
these are based on what was the cheapest
when I place my order screen tried
everything so you guys can see but when
I place my order the jcat make up
primary spray in Rose the hydrating
long-lasting primer Speight prime this
primer spray was on sale for three
dollars and fifty cents I did already
own this one so I didn't have to buy
this I think I bought everything else
yeah pretty sure everything else I
bought but I did own this one already I
think I tried this in shadow and
schmooze a while ago don't really
remember what I think of it I haven't
used it since then oh I hate the smell
this I'm not a rose and kind of go
skin's looking pretty glowy though the
lowest price foundation was the wet and
wild photo focus Foundation actually got
the shade Shell ivory I have this
foundation but I'm pretty sure I have it
in the shade porcelain so I wanted to
try the shade shell ivory since I did a
review video on that right when this
came out pretty sure they expanded the
shade range and this shade looks like it
might be pretty good I haven't tried
this foundation since I've had dry skin
so I'm also curious how it's gonna work
now I got this for $3.59 it was on sale
I'm gonna give this a shake okay wash my
brushes the other day ooh wow this oh
yeah oh yeah that scent but this feels a
lot more lightweight I was gonna say
that I remember this is totally
different than I remember it feels right
now like the Maybelline fit me doing
smooth the way it's kind of gliding on
it feels very buttery it literally
smells like Bell's bar pink Wow I feel
like I'm in Home Depot I just want to
know what is in this that is causing
that smell but the shade is looking
pretty nice looking at my neck this is
looking entirely different than it used
to look on my skin I don't know if I can
get over the scent though my nose is all
sore today cuz when I woke up this
morning somehow I was like face down and
I went to stand up in my nose ring like
caught on the pillow fun morning that's
a little sore there alright looking
pretty good it seems like it's kind of
mattifying I like how it looks right
when it first goes on and then it does
look like it's kind of turning into like
a satin matte I'm gonna build up certain
spots just with sponge
and I saw this concealer pop up as the
cheapest I got really excited cuz I've
never tried this and I haven't I don't
think I'm pretty gonna talk about this
this is the NYX gotcha Covered
concealer I got two shades the lightest
shade 0/0 alabaster and then zero one
ivory that's supposed to be full
coverage and it says dewy finish all-day
wear I'm just gonna start out with like
a super tiny amount for under oh wow
this feels thick reminding me of the
model's own full coverage concealer the
way this feels very tacky very sticky
that looks very yellow I'm probably
gonna mix in a little bit of the other
shade just to hopefully get a little
less yellow I mean it brightened but not
full coverage I can still see darkness
and freckles coming through so let's try
the other shade and we're gonna take a
really small amount oh yeah this is
definitely more kind of salmon colored
which I prefer not feeling this
concealer is so freakin sticky feels
like you're kind of putting like Elmer's
glue underneath your eye hard pass on
that concealer I can like feel it
underneath my eyes what the heck the
cheapest price powder at one dollar and
ninety nine cents was the essence fixing
powder they recently kind of repackaged
all their stuff we're now just kind of
like this little pan thing where you can
actually stick it in one of the pallets
that they have on there and pretty sure
this is not magnetic so you couldn't
stick it in like a Z pellet and it's
pretty raised so you'd have to get their
palate this is obviously a super small
pan for a powder face powder I'm gonna
use this for underneath my eyes and for
setting parts of my face if I need to
I'll probably have to set my cheek area
cuz it does feel a little bit tacky and
the foundation now is oxidizing and
pretty sure you guys can see that there
is a line right there where it almost
looks like orange on my neck start up by
setting my under eyes I've been using
this BH Cosmetics brush 1:37
I always linked the brushes I use down
below has like a slight white oh yeah
so I usually like using white powders
usually mixed in with my Physicians
Formula one to set my under eyes I hate
using translucent powders because it
usually takes away all the coverage and
it just makes it look like a dry hot
mess under there considering that the
concealer looked really shitty this
actually
making it look a lot better and doesn't
seem to be taking away the coverage I
think if I was using my normal
concealers I would definitely give this
another go I'm gonna use this to set
this area of my face see how much it
kind of lightens and obviously using a
brush like this you're just gonna have
to just burst it in there if it is such
a small compact so I'm just setting my
cheek area so that I can blend blush
bronzer and highlight easier
I might actually blend this down my neck
a little bit since it does have a tiny
bit of white to it just to make that
line we have going on a little less
intense yeah if we're sure has a tiny
bit of white to it so if you have fair
skin might like this one two bucks I
mean you'd go through this probably
pretty fast like the size of my shadow I
don't like setting my forehead except
dry skin and I like the do up there so
the same kind of essence little powders
we're the cheapest for bronzer and blush
as well so this is the bronzer this one
was also $1.99 and this is in the shade
0-1 hello sunshine essence in the past
for me every single one their bronzes
I've tried pretty sure has been like
straight-up orange so hopefully that's
not the case with this guy I'm just
gonna start out with a little bit okay
it's looking a lot better on camera in
real life it does look a bit warmer than
what I usually like but I think if you
had a tiny bit darker skin tone than I
do this one could work doesn't look bad
I mean other essence Brown there's
definitely look more orange this one
doesn't like straight-up tangerine but
it's definitely a very very warm bronzer
doesn't look bad I'm actually gonna put
a little bit of this on my temples I'm
gonna kind of just diffuse it out with
my duo fiber brush this is the Sigma F
15
alright blush we've got another essence
one I'm assuming this one was also $1.99
let's check yep this one was also $1.99
s this is in the shade 0-3 rosy glow
looks like a nice tone I'm gonna take
same brush about this brush off Amazon
like a down below
oh that's pigmented I literally just
tapped in one time definitely need to do
some blending between the blush and the
under eyes right now and this bronzer
but the shade of
this looks really pretty whenever I want
to just tone down the whole blush
bronzer situation I have going on I just
go in with that same face powder
whatever you know using and just blend
right over top of it with this brush
this is the furl SC before and it just
makes a world of difference if you just
use a tiny bit of your face powder and
blend it over like look that looks so
much more soft and blended I'm
pleasantly surprised by this powder
looking really just soft on my face - it
doesn't look like those kind of powders
that you can see sitting on top of your
skin these are so freakin tiny these
would be good little things to travel
with okay I just realized the highlight
was also essence this is another little
one this is zero one let it glow and the
essence a shadow and snow flake and
apricot ah our bomb and those are also
about a dollar - I don't think I've
tried this highlighter which is actually
like intended to be a highlighter so I'm
curious I don't know if this is new or
if this was another one that was just
kind of repackaged taking my Sigma fo3
okay I like a very subtle highlight
because I do have a lot of texture right
there on my face that was pretty nice
this isn't gonna be like a real intense
pop and kind of highlight but if you're
someone who also likes more subtle yeah
very subtle and you have to layer this
up I feel like this is definitely one
that would look different depending on
the brush you use I'm layering this up
to get this kind of look but once it's
layered I mean it looks pretty and it
doesn't seem to be overly emphasizing
when I have a more subtle highlight like
this I do like adding it kind of right
to the middle of my brow and up more
subtle then essence snow flake eyeshadow
and apricot ah alright there were some
other brands besides essence in here but
for eyebrow pencil again essence was the
cheapest so this was $1.99 it's the
eyebrow designer pencil I'm pretty sure
I've tried this again don't really
remember what I think of it it's 0/7
dark chocolate I did just pluck my brows
this morning first time in forever I
don't love actual pencils like this
because then you have to sharpen him
does anyone actually know where their
pencil sharpener is working fine it
doesn't feel to glide II like it doesn't
feel too pigmented for brow pencil looks
good if I was recommending a similar
price point I pencil
the elf micro pencil I think it's pretty
new is really goodness a few bucks it's
the black outside one I'll link it down
below too I don't use a lot because the
shade is a little bit off for me but the
actual formula is nice if you can find a
shade that matches you and that one oh
just one above the brow now that I have
both my brows on actually think the
shade doesn't look too off kind of like
it
so far so good we're doing pretty good
overall besides that concealer the
reason I can't find my screen try this
one but I'm pretty sure this is a dollar
this was the cheapest primer the elf
shadow lock eyelid primer I don't love
these types of primers because I like
more of like an opaque kind of base
that's just gonna make my shadows pop
and this type of primer is just more in
line with something like the Urban Decay
primer potion which wow I haven't heard
anything about that in like years so if
you like that kind of primer then this
one would probably be more up your alley
but I'm like a Mac Paint Pot kind of gal
Starbucks nitro cold brew a sweet cream
literally the best Starbucks drink
they've ever come out with only certain
locations have it for some reason but if
you can find a Starbucks by you that
carries it it is bomb eyeshadows I kind
of messed up though the cheapest one was
the essence must-haves customizable
palettes whoops
pretty sure I thought it came with those
shades like the purples that they have
listed in the photo but it's just the
actual palette so I guess now I have
something to stick all these little
loose things into I got this wet and
wild one too
the next one over which was 399 and they
had two different shades on there one
was like the super bright colors and the
other one was the naked truth which are
these more neutrals I was gonna use
these as like crease colors and then the
purple on my lid but since I just have
this this is what we're gonna work with
for the most part I'm a fan of wet and
wild eyeshadows especially their new
palettes those are bomb and they're
super affordable I can get this open
every single time the only thing with
wet and wild shadows does you think
you're trying to like break into a bank
right now Oh interesting so this brow
bone shaved actually looks like kind of
like a mint ooh that's pretty see this
other shade oh that looks pretty too
though that I feel like would go with my
shirt more I also I'm gonna use this
shade that we used for the bronzer so
I'm actually gonna start out with this
kind of as like a transition crease
color or my brushes I still have half my
makeup in my travel makeup bag
okay now I'm gonna go in with this
definer color which is the deep brown
right there so I'm just kind of making
like a v-shape right there put this
brown and then blending it out this
shade right here is kind of calling my
name for the lid but I might use this as
an inner corner I think that might look
good so let's go and with that whatever
the shade is like kind of taupe I went
first go in with my finger and then
might use a brush just to get it right
where I want it in certain areas not
super shimmery or anything kind of more
like a sheen try and use a wet brush
with this to see if we can get it to pop
a little bit more alright a little bit
more
does about the same with finger and a
wet brush I'm just going back in with
the bronzer to blend out at the front
right here now
let's go with that lime green ish kind
of shade hopefully this one has a nice
shimmer to it for the inner corner
almost makes you look a little bit
sickly it's like a little bit too dark
green for the inner corner again more of
like a sheen not super shimmery I'm
gonna take the highlight shade how did
this literally end up across the room I
think that's gonna have to do for the
inner corner today because I don't
really have another option here I'm
gonna go into the same kind of chocolate
brown shade and just smudge that on my
lower lashline I think I have a pencil
liner and a liquid liner under the
eyeliner category they had a mix of
pencils and liquids there so I just
bought the cheapest of each so the
cheapest liquid liner was the elf jet
black liquid eyeliner and then the
cheapest other one was essence casual I
never has eight Kajal casual pencil in
zero one and black camera if I've used
this exact essence I learned but I'm
gonna try it for the waterline it's kind
of like flake in a bit yeah not a fan of
this one especially for the waterline
it's one of those just doesn't really
stick to the waterline so let's try this
liquid liner these kind of applicators
scare the crap out of me because I've
tried this a long time ago and it's one
of those brush applicators that's just
very flimsy so pretty tricky to get a
wing and you just have to be really
careful actually before I go in with
eyeliner and start finishing up my eyes
I'm gonna spray my face with setting
spray I usually like doing this before
scaring everything just you don't have
to worry about everything transferring
so this is the elf makeup missing set in
clear
I thought the illuminating one yeah I
definitely order the illuminating one
and that was the cheapest on there but I
mean they're all priced the same they're
all $4
the elf setting spray is $4 the only
thing used to be like 3 definitely have
one of these already oh I might have
used it up I've been trying to use up
this one for using it as like eyeshadow
to wet my eyeshadows ooh that smells not
pleasant it smells like a locker room
I'm gonna give it another spritz of the
jcat one just to give a little bit more
glow buy another spritz I mean like for
wow it can listen does it give you a
pretty glow though that Drake at one
wish me luck cross your fingers hope for
the best
I do have false lashes to put on so I
might not do a wing because I think that
might be a disaster with this and I
think I'm just going to do a normal line
I might like smudge out the outer edge
I'm just gonna smudge it out with I
guess my eyebrow brush because I can't
find my normal flat edge brush right now
it's on the outer part of that just to
kind of shape it a little bit just
because when you don't do a wing
sometimes it can look a little bit funky
if you just have like a blunt stop right
there so whenever I don't do a wing I
usually kind of smudge the outer part
dries down pretty fast you don't have to
worry about it like transferring up to
your litter anything that did the job
nothing to write home about but we have
eyeliner on so I did get lashes but I
want to first put on a coat of mascara
so this is the elf volumizing mascara in
black this was $2.00 all four of the
cheezer's mascaras were by elf on there
two of them are two dollars two or three
dollars what separates the two from the
three that's what I want to know this
one I would call more lengthening than
luminizing I'm not getting a whole lot
of volume but it is separating and
lengthening so the two cheapest lashes
they're both two dollars from elf so I
got the dramatic lash set the other one
was the natural lash kit these don't
look very dramatic and they're also like
those lashes at almost every lash is
like the exact same length which tends
to be not the most flattering lash okay
so my lashes are on I have no idea what
lipstick colors I picked out or lip
liner
anything so let's just cross our fingers
here looks like I picked up some
different colors that don't go together
at all this is the essence long-lasting
lip liner so this was the cheapest one
at 249 this one is retractable cool this
isn't a shade zero 7 in plum cake the
cheapest lipstick was actually a makeup
revolution one but they were totally out
of stock of it so I went with the next
step one which was just a few cents more
$2.99 the j-cap Beauty lipsticks this is
in the shade FL 107 to 7 a Honeycrisp
and then this one is vanilla bean
so essence lip liners are great i
actually really like their
non-retractable ones I'm just gonna
totally cover my lip in this kind of
like this purple shade actually this is
the vanilla bean one I'm just gonna try
it right on the center if I don't like
it I'll just go back over the with the
lip liner there she looks pretty good
alright so overall I feel like that went
pretty well
for trying out the cheapest makeup on
Ulta it doesn't really matter the price
tag there are some balm $1.00 items
there are some balm high-end makeup I
just feel like it's the actual product
so I'm gonna have everything I tried
