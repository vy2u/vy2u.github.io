box if you follow me on Instagram I
asked you guys if you wanted to see this
and you did so here we are
how cute is the color and packaging I
think I'm gonna keep this box just for
shits and giggles look at it so if you
have never heard of
Mimi box it's not a subscription box
which I really like because that's just
too much commitment for me if you pay by
the month and you get to choose which
box you want they have a ton of
options they have the Mimi box super box
and lucky box you can read the
differences on their website so with the
Mimi box you get four to eight full-size
products I'm reading it off of their
website right now and deluxe samples
this box is from Korea which is really
awesome Cree is really great with
skincare and beauty products so when I
saw that it's from Korea I was like hell
yeah sign me up they have tons of
different options on here mask Edition
waterproof makeup box whole grain box
chocolate there's like a chocolate one I
don't know what that is they also have
like color coated boxes they have tons
of things this is unlike any other box
service that I've seen and that's why I
wanted to do this review for you guys
they did send me this box so I didn't
get to choose which one I wanted I
haven't opened it yet I don't know which
one I got if at any point you're
interested and you want to purchase it
yourself I will have coupon codes listed
down below for you guys so you can go
ahead and get it let's just get into
this the Sun is going down right now so
I feel like I don't look a little bit
orange but I didn't feel my shadow in
shmooze video on the look I'm wearing
right now so if you want to see that it
will be up after this video I think yeah
alright so let's just open this up I
have no idea which box I got it looks
like I got these skincare box which is
cool because I've got some major cystic
acne happening on my chin again it is
starting to clear up is a lot worse I
broke out really bad from the Maybelline
@bb
cream which I have a whole review on if
you want to see it so they give you this
paper explaining all the products it
tells you information about it like
usual this is what happens with box this
is the dr. yang you what you Uline
clearing mist supposed to be a clearing
this for flawless back in chest so if
you have back me then this might be good
for you this is a full-size product it
looks like definitely went out of order
yeah so this is a full-size product you
get 140 milliliters and it retails for
$49 so already most of their boxes
retail between like 20 and $30 so
already this product covers the cost of
the box if you think of it like that I
really like how they give you an English
version since most of the products are
in Korean on the back so it says it has
ever match don't know what that is in
tea tree oil smells like tea tree oil I
wonder if you get sprays on your face so
it looks like I got the box for oily
skin which is great sensitive skin
that's prone to breaking out which is
perfect for me because that's exactly
what I have next there's this serie
called red spot cream and that says that
it's supposed to heal speed up the
healing process of inflamed acne skin
this is also a full-size product that
retails for $23 it says it a promise is
the whitening brightening effect as well
as clearing affect asian beauty products
are usually all about brightening and
whitening which I like because I have a
lot of acne scarring it looks kind of
like toothpaste in there so I'll
probably be using this after I get rid
of my cystic acne to help with acne
scarring I am back on Proactiv right now
to get rid of that oh and even notice
the front it's cute or something don't
even know where I'm gonna put this
because I literally have everything
packed up to go right now and there's
this sellable recovery Vaughn it's an
anti wrinkle whitening bomb in its SPF
28 I always wonder like what makes them
do SPF 28 and not 30 you know such a
random number full-size products that
retails for $50 holy says that it
has long-lasting coverage oh it's a BB
cream being a multifunctional BB cream
it also provides whitening and anti
wrinkle effects so let's see what color
this is
hopefully it's light enough
Asian BB Creams are usually pretty good
about being like let's see the coverage
of this guy whoa
feels pretty thick that's pretty good
coverage as far as I can tell on the
back of my hand
comment down below if you guys want to
see a shadow in shmooze video using this
curious to try us out and it says that
it's not supposed to break you out every
single BB cream I've tried has broken me
out so we'll see by the way I got one
two three four five six full-size
products in here looks like oh and then
some kind of knife which I'll show you
right now alright don't know what the
heck this is looks like it'd be a good
butter knife though now I kind of want a
peanut butter jelly sandwich so then I
got the five something cleansing gel so
the full-size version of this retails
for thirty one dollars says that this
has a special ingredient boolean aaalac
acid alright looks like it's just a
cleansing gel that you massaged into
your face wait about 30 seconds letting
the makeup melt and then wash it off so
just a gel cleanser basically it's all
they had to say this thing looks very
peculiar this is a tea tree modeling
package with a spatula oh this is my
spatula for this thing it looks like
this is some kind of max that you mix
with the water and then it tells you
what ratio to do you can't mix it too
slower it'll harden and then you wait
for it to harden like rubber and then
you peel it off your face so basically
it's like a do-it-yourself peel-off mask
this looks pretty intense I would have
to have time to dedicate to this the
last thing I have in here is an original
pure all cleansing bar the full-size
product retails for $14 it's an
all-natural cleansing bar that is
supposed to remove all excess sebum and
blackheads from your skin let's see how
it smells like the color of the box
seemed like a fancy little package whew
smells super minty this smells really
good actually
like in this I've never used a like a
bar soap thing for my face before so
that was everything in my box it is
completely empty I will for sure be
purchasing more of these boxes because
some of these look really cool on here
the waterproof makeup one is really
appealing to me they also have the lucky
box which is really cool it's just a box
where they bring back their most popular
products so if you don't want to gamble
with getting ones that you like and
don't like you can just trust the
viewers and get ones that have been
liked before but a real sentence so if
you liked this video and you want to try
out
mimimi box be sure to give it a thumbs
up so I know like I said all the links
will be down below if you want to check
it out get some coupon codes you can do
that if you want to see this look make
sure you're subscribed because it will
be coming up next
Sun is officially down love you guys

video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
