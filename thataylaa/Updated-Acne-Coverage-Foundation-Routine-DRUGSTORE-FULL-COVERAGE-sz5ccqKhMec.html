now shame all right so today it is
almost just at its foundation Friday it
is not foundation Friday but that will
be up in a few days but today I wanted
to do an all drugstore acne coverage
routine I have combination skin with
cystic acne if you're new here I do a
ton of videos for people with pale skin
acne foundation is my love in life I get
so much joy from trying out new
foundations depending on what your skin
tone is in skin type as we go through
the video I shared it four options with
you and how to adapt it for your own
skin color or skin type
I have tried out my fair share of
drugstore foundations and this
combination is one of my favorites it
has taken me years to embrace my pale
skin embrace the skin I'm in right now
and I hope that by watching this video
you can learn some tips and products
that can help you do the same whether
you have acne or rosacea or any kind of
skin condition your skin and your
outside it doesn't define you so I love
you guys I hope you find this video
helpful if you do while you're watching
make sure you give it a thumbs up let's
do this
so let's pin back the hair so people
don't have a panic attack when this is
going up I will have already actually
done the next hair stage going to silver
hopefully I'm silver I'm pre recording a
ton of videos right now for while I'm
gone so if you want updates in real time
you can always follow me on snapchat
Twitter Instagram you know the deal this
is what my skin looks like without
makeup I have a ton of videos on acne
coverage and confidence with pale skin
I've struggled with cystic acne for
years now 99% of time I like to prime my
face if you are looking for an
affordable drugstore option just be
aware of the ingredients a lot of
primers break me out one of the ones
that doesn't and that I really like is
maybelline master prime blur and
illuminate this is an illuminating
primer but just gives you this really
nice kind of glow underneath your makeup
and it does have SPF in it and even if
you're not pale you should be put an SPF
on your face every day so if I have a
lot to cover up which I usually do I go
to acne coverage drugstore foundation is
the elf acne fighting foundation this
actually has really
some coverage beautiful finish last
really well throughout the day but if
you're pale princess this one will be
too dark so personally I have to mix
this in with something if you're darker
than I am you could definitely get by
with just applying this this is in the
shade ivory and it has salicylic acid
witch hazel came for tea tree and aloe
but today I'm going to be mixing it with
a hard candy glamoflauge and a shade
porcelain this is kind of my favorite
drugstore mixer to lighten foundations
and it does have some added coverage in
it I don't like wearing this by itself
just because it doesn't last that well
throughout the day and the finish of it
is can look a little bit heavy but these
two mixed together work really well for
me if you just want a straight-up mixer
to lighten it drugstore next Pro
foundation mixer in the white shade this
one doesn't give any added coverage
which is why I'm not using it today or
you can also just mix in a good old
concealer that you have laying around
even if you're not trying to necessarily
lighten your foundation if you have a
foundation and you just want to add a
little bit more coverage just mix in a
little bit of concealer hard candy
glamoflauge is really great has a ton of
coverage I couldn't find mine so I just
have the Maybelline master conceal here
to show you only what I've been doing
just so I have to use less foundation is
actually spot concealing first so I just
put a little bit of that Maybelline
master conceal on the back of my palette
and I'm going to go with the morphe G 38
brush this is an awesome brush for
blending concealer under your eyes and
just spot concealing I love this for
concealer now we're going to go ahead
and dip that in and then I'm basically
just going to spot conceal some of my
major acne spots and if you can cover up
some of the redness and problem areas
before you go in with concealer it's
going to have to use a lot less product
I don't think I've ever done this in a
video this is kind of a recent thing for
me those days when I do spa concealers
days when I still don't it just kind of
depends on what I'm feeling
my biggest tip if you're going to be
spot concealing it's fine to concealer
that actually sets on your face that way
when you blend foundation on top it's
not just gonna smear it all around
concealer is going to actually set
before you apply your liquid foundation
typically on an everyday basis I use
Tarte shape tape but this is not
drugstore so we're not using it today
freakin amazing concealer this is
honestly worth the money
perfect for under the eyes I don't set
it with the powder perfect for spot
concealing you get twice the amount of
product in here
subtle concealers so in my opinion is
totally worth it so just to give you
guys a little update on my acne have a
couple videos explaining my acne story
what's going on right now is that I
tried spironolactone for four months it
didn't do a whole lot so now I'm off of
it again and I kind of told myself if
the spironolactone
doesn't work that was kind of my last
resort before going on accutane so I
think I am gonna look into accutane just
because I'm 24 and I want to have acne
for the next five years and I've tried
so many different pills and medicines
and creams and over-the-counter stuff
prescription stuff and it just hasn't
worked so I'll keep you guys updated but
might be going on accutane soon I did
already have the like consultation
appointment months ago and it just
wasn't the right time for me if you've
been on accutane let me know your
experience with it down below a lot of
people swear by it
some people have horror stories but I
feel like that's with any medication and
any anything so now we're going to go in
with the foundation I'm going to mix
these two on the back of a pallet I
really like the tone of the elf
foundation it kind of has this like
baiji tone to it so it's pretty neutral
I used to be super cool toned and now I
feel like I'm more on the neutral side
so I'm just going to dab this over the
face and the brush I'm going to be using
is the morphe g36 this is a great
foundation brush I've been using lately
and when you apply your foundation if
you want the most coverage you
definitely are going to want to Pat it
into your skin versus like fully buffing
it and as you can see this is covering
super well foundation combinations our
life don't be afraid to mix foundations
I still want to do a video all about my
favorite foundation combinations but
just try stuff out if you have a
foundation of hey boys this hairdo but
basically I just think about what a
foundation is mixing and if there's a
another product that can complement that
just mix it together so the finish of
the elf foundation only worn it by
itself a few times because it is too
dark if I'm remembering it's more on the
like satin dewy side and then mixed in
the hard candy foundation it's a little
more satin satin matte but we do get a
really nice skin like finish which is
the goal especially when you have acne
and a bunch of texture on your face my
forehead doesn't have a whole lot of
problem areas mostly just freckles and
red
and morphe brushes are very affordable
there are ones that I love and I stand
behind and I support and there are other
brushes that I think are pretty shitty
honestly so all the ones I'm using in
this video I recommend this is the time
where if there's any areas that I feel
like we need a little bit more coverage
you can just go back in with the
foundation I still have a ton of product
on here by the way you can just go back
in and kind of stipple it on any areas
but honestly especially with that
concealer first I think we're looking
good so super pretty satin finish really
great coverage doesn't look too cakey or
heavy so now onto concealer one of my
favorite concealers of all time is the
collection cosmetics lasting perfection
concealer and get this at the drugstore
I believe in the UK brand isn't carried
in drugstores in the US I get this off
of eBay for like eight or nine bucks I
think I know it's way cheaper than that
in places where you can actually access
it in store but this is my favorite
drugstore concealer having pale skin
your options are pretty limited for
drugstore concealers find one that's
light enough and that has a good formula
it's pretty tricky so one of the things
I do if you're having issues finding
concealer that's light enough mixing a
little bit of the next HG photogenic
concealer in lavender it is lavender but
somehow it magically lightens your
concealer and just makes it look very
brightening under the eyes so if you
don't want to order this collection
Cosmetics concealer online and then use
your favorite drugstore concealer just
mix in some of that next and a concealer
brush I'm using is the same that we spot
concealed with the G 38 by morphe now
you're going to want to set your under
eye concealer favorite under eye setting
powder from the drugstore is the
Physicians Formula mineral where telc
free translucent correcting powder quite
the name I've mentioned this five
billion times on my channel I actually
have a brand new one right here to use
well bro this is just light enough for
my skin it's grace its grace there's a
lot of grand lace from bachelor in
paradise favorite brush to apply matarae
setting powders is one by elf I never
remember the name of this so I will link
all these brushes all these products I'm
using down below in the description box
we're just going to swirl tap make sure
you tap off the excess and then I'm just
going to press this into my under eyes
and this just does a really great job of
setting the concealer and brightening
under there
I would say this combination i just used
could totally work for dry skin oily
skin i've combination skin it'll kind of
just be up to you whether or not you
want to powder your face afterwards to
set it the way that this is setting i
honestly could probably get away without
a setting powder but if you have skin
where you need to set your foundation or
if you want it to last longer set your
foundation with the powder
drugstore favorite powder right now has
been maybelline better skin in the shade
ten porcelain this is beautiful my main
reason for applying a setting powder
usually is so that i can easily blend my
blush bronzer and highlight on top it's
just way easier for blending on top of a
powder versus on top of a consistency
that's a little bit stickier so if
you're like me and you like the look of
kind of doing this on your forehead
sometimes i feel like when i don't set
my forehead it just makes my overall
face look more like skin so that's what
i'm gonna be doing today i'm just going
to be setting kind of the bottom half of
my face my favorite powder brush lately
has been the morphe 44 unfortunately
they discontinued the elite one
collection line and now all the elite
collection has this red top which I
actually think is not the prettiest some
of the new elite 2 collection brushes
are not as soft as the original ones
I typed in the e-40 for two more feet
just before filming this and they do
have a new elite 2 version of the e 44
it's not the same exact brush and I
don't have it so I'm not sure if it's a
duplicate but I do have the e 1 brush
which is quite a bit bigger but this one
is soft and this one feels really nice
but today I'm just gonna use my original
44 I like that it's a little bit smaller
and a little bit more compact probably
order the new e 44 just to see for you
guys but I'm just going to set my face
again using patting motions it is a
little bit more on the matte side but
isn't like dole matte so I'm just gonna
leave my forehead so I can still get
that do so that is everything I love the
way this looks it gives me completely
full coverage all affordable products
here is a before just so you guys can
see
okay so the rest of my makeup is on
obviously I just filmed a video on this
look so when it is live I will link it
down below in the description box I'm
pretty sure it'll be going up after this
video I bronzer highlight rest of the
products I used on my face all those
details will be in the other video but I
