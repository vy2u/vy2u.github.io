the vlog without a face mask on right
now so this is my future self coming to
you I just want to start off this vlog
because I realized it never really did
the beginning on the vlog is kind of
backwards but I'll show you guys when we
go back in time it'll make sense thumbs
up for a 30-minute long vlogs I hope you
guys enjoy grab a cup of coffee grab a
snack here we go
all right good morning guys I just
showered I have had not enough coffee
figured I would just get ready with you
guys this morning I'm gonna use the
cosmetics CC illumination I want to go
grab some coffee it's also a hella nice
outside right now so I kinda want to
just like go on a drive and get out of
the house first thing in the morning
it's like hey right now I think so my
sure guys everything I picked up from
thredUP today because it's been sitting
in my apartment for like a month now
which is kind of fun because I have no
idea what I got like I literally
completely forget what I actually
ordered oh and my battery's dying
awesome looking glowy folks I just love
how like healthy this stuff makes your
skin look essential Phineas's fiber
vitamins and minerals and this one aid
so I'm just watching her vlog by XI and
XO I got Cosmo bagels which have been
great and also not so great because I've
been eating bagels every morning this is
my favorite cheese of life so I finish
up my makeup everything except lips I
hate putting on lipstick before I eat
breakfast I put on that CC cream that
you guys saw it and then I powdered with
Too Faced chocolate whole cycle
yeah the chocolate powder my contour and
highlight are the cosmetics my sculpted
face palette blushes Too Faced pop don't
peach as I just used the same a
cosmetics palette and like just smudge
brown everywhere and then lashes I love
these these are the pure jetsedder
lashes brows I tried to do like a little
bit more fluffy ooh big already a half
shot by the way all right so I think I
actually want to try on my startup stuff
and open this right now because
a I'm too excited be I have a lot of
energy right now and I don't really feel
like any more coffee well probably go to
Starbucks or something in a couple hours
thread up box makes me so excited this
portion of the vlog is sponsored by
thread up I've worked with them a couple
other times because I genuinely love
them and I'm addicted to thread up but
I've got a lot of messages from you guys
saying you are also now addicted thread
up and let's get situated or did so if
you've never heard of thread up they're
basically a wool almost just sliced my
hand open
you know those scissors that are so
freakin sharp basically an online
second-hand store so they have tons of
different brands on there they pretty
much have all the main brands like they
have Nike Medina's Free People Toby
Banana Republic Gap or maybe you name it
who they have different tissue paper the
little things in life I see for anything
so I totally forget what I ordered
place this order awhile ago I see
something that is free this is the
Victoria Secret one so I got this furry
Victoria's Secret jacket oh my god this
is way thicker than I thought it was
gonna be I could sleep in this thing
I've been really procrastinating turning
on the heat basically been like sleeping
in jackets like this check out this
freaking hood hell yeah
let's check out how much this stuff was
if you don't have a top socket best
invention of 2017 this was originally 71
bucks
I got it for $26.99 oh yeah this is Sam
oh these are Stuart Wiseman they just
look big what size do they get so it
says these are size four and a half
which is probably why I got these these
are Stuart Weitzman wise men or Weitzman
I don't even know until I know my
designers but these were originally four
hundred sixty-five dollars and I got
them for twenty dollars and 99
since let's see if these stick oh they
totally fit they just sound like a
pointy ER tough blue I feel like what do
I feel like oh these are cute they're
like super comfy around my ankle you
know those things that just hook your
ankle perfectly I can't tell if it makes
my feet look too big like for my body
this toe part is like pretty long and
pointy like my toe ends right here I
think I went a little bit sweater crazy
but tis the season you know this is an
off-the-shoulder sweater by Express
originally $50 and I got it for $9.99
that one looks like panini oh by the way
oh this is sparkly I didn't I don't
think I knew this was partly not usually
into a sparkly sweaters but this
actually might be cute I don't know
where was this from oh this was also
expressed this was originally $50 notes
$12.99 I am all about this like neon
orange red color I love this for the
winter and fall I feel like this in the
snow looks so nice where's the head oh
this is like a major major turtleneck so
this is H&amp;amp;M and it size large but I
think I wanted to get it because I could
wear it with like leggings or something
this was originally $20 and I got it for
$7.99 oh this is hella soft ooh I love
that color
another turtleneck I'm into the
turtlenecks right now this is Express
oh it's cashmere so I tell us off this
was originally 107 and I got it for 20
2.99 oh I love this like half turtleneck
kind of thing what is that called H&amp;amp;M so
when was $20 and I got it for 1099 super
cute I think I'm good on the sweaters
for a while okay this one
you know those purchases where it's like
it's either just hideous
or it's hideous but it works I kind of
like it or no I kind of feel like I just
married going back home to visit the
family in like Wisconsin kind of man
maybe this guy wouldn't be married maybe
he's still single I picture this with
like a black slouchy beanie black ripped
jeans or something I think
this was actually expressed this was
originally 107:20 2.99 really so nice
letters where am I gonna put these off
next up I love this pukey brown color
it's like one of my favorite colors sure
this with like a dark red lip this was
originally 20 and I got it for 1099
remember when I was shopping online I
was looking at a bunch of different faux
leather or like leather skirts because
I've never found one that really fits me
well oh this one actually looks like it
has potential because there's stretching
things on the side $27 and I got it for
$5.99 then last thing I got looks like
this is like oh that's interesting
Taylor why did I get this I guess that's
kind of cute maybe that could work was I
awake when I ordered this oh I think I
got it because it was only $6.99 so I
was like maybe it'll work alright I want
to try it on these gettin old okay I
actually kind of oddly love this jacket
I feel like it's one of those things
that could look cheap if it was with a
certain outfit but if you wore this with
really nice like dark dark denim like
the length of it the length is perfect
it's not like too long and then
underneath it I have on that hmm I think
this one was H&amp;amp;M I love this neckline
with one hand this one I love I feel
like I'll get a lot of wear out of this
it has like a slit down the side and it
goes longer in the back this would look
really cute with leggings so here is the
camel colored sweater again super comfy
baggy I love these kind of things in the
phone winter this was like a chunky
cream scarf would look really cute maybe
like a leather jacket or a coat or
something okay I wouldn't wear it with
this sweater I just tucked it in really
quick but this skirt is actually so cute
I feel like it fits really nice and it
has the nice slouchy things on the side
I almost ate walking over here in
these shoes last thing I want to try on
is this hoodie cuz I'm so excited about
this holy see this is warm I'm so
happy right now throwing up you can shop
online and also on their app I like
doing that because it's just easier I
like to actually search by brand you can
search by category and you can have your
preset sizes and
and everything so just super quick and
easy because you have to like sort
through 5,000 things or you can just
type in and search that's usually what I
do so I'll just search like express
water it's right here and then you can
go through and shop so if you've never
shopped on thredUP I'm gonna have the
link down below in the description right
at the top that'll give you 40% off your
first order which is awesome thanks to
thread up for hooking it up battery's
gonna die oh I can't move in this thing
if you make videos external hard drives
are life savers I have to back up my
computer like every few days because the
storage gets full because video files
take up so much for good space I think
today's gonna be a major editing day
look at this a boat get thing going on
right now is it bouquet or Boca okay I
still have the cooler in my taxi I'm
actually seeing that friend tonight for
happy hours so it'll finally be out of
my car but I'm taking a work break right
now and going to Starbucks but I realize
the zombie Frappuccino thing came out so
I think I want to try it I'm also gonna
get espresso because gotta have the
caffeine oh yeah hey can I please get
the tall zombie Frappuccino the tall one
zombie yep
and then a tall isotopy oh it's just a
tiny bit of cream please that's it yeah
thank you
all right it just got it I thought it
was gonna be like blue and green but has
purple whipped cream which is very
exciting I have no idea what this is
supposed to taste like let's go
oh oh dude I think that's worse than the
pink drink purple drink blue drink
combined this tastes like ginger bread
pumpkin pepto-bismol comment down below
if you have tried this zombie drink and
what you think of it because I honestly
don't think this tastes good in the
slightest I want to try this whipped
cream though ohh
even the whipped cream tastes bad that's
all of that I'm having I'm gonna go back
work for a few hours and then I'm
meeting up with my friend the cooler
friend and we're gonna go to this place
it looks really cool it's called Essex
check out these frickin drinks these
look awesome put them in like Tiki
glasses that is a drink right there Oh
something else I wanted to tell you guys
this is super exciting so I don't have a
hundred percent of the details when I'm
filming this right now if you're in the
Washington area specifically Spokane or
like if you're in Coeur d'Alene anywhere
around there I am gonna be doing a
meet-up Project Beauty share which is a
nonprofit that I work with they're doing
an event called Spalla days that I could
guess they do every year with northern
quest because you know and northern
quest was awesome enough to host a
meet-up for us save the date for Sunday
November 19th they can all have more
info in the description box and at the
pin comment I'll have to get a ticket to
go to the meetup but a hundred percent
of the proceeds go to project be sure so
it's a great way to hang out with other
burritos and just chill and talk about
makeup there's gonna be like
non-alcoholic drinks and munchies and
stuff and by going you're also
supporting project that you share so I'm
super excited thank you to project
Beauty share and Northern quests for
hosting so I'm gonna be in Spokane that
Sunday and Monday and then I actually
leave for Organ on Tuesday and I'm gone
for like a week I need to get a few
weeks ahead and videos again okay I
think my succulent thrives on neglect
and consent stress because when I bride
don't pay him any attention he's
thriving okay living I just got back
from dinner update on the cocktails
didn't even get a tiki caps that the
food was really good I got a Caesar
salad and potato wedge things but this
foundation combo I feel like it's
holding up amazing I'm not getting any
creasing I was just looking at it really
up-close maybe I need to start wearing
that to face powder more because it
looks like it did when I first applied
it have I ever liked
better I feel like in every vlog a they
start the blog in a face mask where
there's a face mask involved at some
point but I leave for California and
tomorrow morning
it's 11:30 right now and I've been up
since 7 o'clock
cleaning organizing doing laundry
packing all the fun stuff now I need to
vacuum the whole apartment but I fly
into LAX for one of my friends weddings
from college I'm super excited Rach is
coming then our other friend that we
went to Mexico with awhile ago
he's coming so we're all gonna stay in
the hotel together in Redondo then I'm
gonna drive from LA to San Diego with
him to stay with my parents for a few
days and see my family and everything so
I'm super excited it's 86 in California
right now
like where is fall it's cold here it's
like rainy and gloomy today I'm feeling
it I'm feeling bold I figured I would
start the vlog here so I can show you
guys some of my trip I'm not gonna be
like vlogging the whole time psych I
don't want just enjoy it and take a
break and stuff right now it is vacuum
house time this by the way never thought
I'd be so excited by a vacuum purchase
about this one I moved in and it is can
you focus it is amazing I'll have this
link down below but it's wireless which
just makes the vacuum being way better
you just charge it and then you put it
in actually got my mom this for her
birthday and she loves it too so I'm
gonna vacuum
the situation in my office right now
yeah so I think today I'm gonna go to TJ
Maxx and try and get a wedding bag to
put this stuff in and a card and stuff
even my two friends are all giving her
the card and present everything together
so we actually got her and her fiance
fiance her husband parasailing because
we didn't let him come to Mexico with us
and we went parasailing in Mexico so we
just got to these bottoms they just
married a little hat and I need to print
out the gift card with the parasailing
stuff face mask I'm trying out today's
the bodyshop Japanese matcha tea Oh guys
know I'm all about the matcha I haven't
started accutane yet because when I
filming this is October 12th I need to
also go to the pharmacy airships and
we're in store and today
pick up the accutane prescription and
started today before the trip so I'll be
packing the Cetaphil moisturizing cream
this is I've heard really good for dry
skin then also the Aqua for healing
ointment my first day will be today a
vacuum so I just quickly showered and
got ready to put on some comfy errand
clothes and then I'll probably put on my
down jacket because it looks like it's
cold and it looks like it's raining so
we are gonna head out so I just got back
and picked up whatever meal this is
right now play 3:30 got Mexican of
course even though I'm gonna be eating
Mexican in every single day in
California refried beans yeah whenever I
get a chili Rondo I just eat around the
batter stuff because the chili part is
amazing and they don't make them without
the batter like anywhere except this one
place in San Diego so I'm gonna you
really pick and then I'll show you guys
what I got at Target hell yeah
okay so it's a few hours later I can't
even see the comic right now because
they'll die guys why basically what
ended up happening was I got the pills
accutane and you're supposed to take it
with like a fatty meal
I've been drinking water all day and
everything so I went got Mexican food
very fatty got some refried bo I showed
you guys that so I was eating the beans
and everything took the day one pill and
then within probably like two minutes
started getting a weird reaction
I started getting super dizzy felt very
out of
like not really all here my vision got
really blurred ended up getting on the
phone with the dermatologist and my
neurologist to make sure that was normal
and it's not a normal reaction for like
first taking it dizziness and vision
affected vision our side effects but
usually that happens like a few days
later or weeks later even months in it's
not usually like an immediate thing so
they both seemed like kind of concerned
I just went back to the pharmacist and I
didn't drive and had her check all the
medications she also didn't find
anything that could be a reaction I had
kind of a similar weird reaction when I
was taking the spironolactone though who
knows I still have blurred vision like I
said I can't see the clock which I
usually can see the time from here the
dermatologist said to stop taking it and
wait three days and then start taking it
which I actually feel good about since
I'll be at my parents house in three
days and that way also I won't be like
drinking right when I started I won't be
at the wedding so it'll probably be good
to be home anyways when I take it for a
second time to see what happens
yeah I'm still hoping for the best the
body is a wonderland so October 12th
won't be day one but I just got a few
things at Target so I figured I'd show
you guys really quickly I did end up
successfully finding the wedding present
bag I just got this cute little love bag
with like a heart and glitter and I went
a little bit card crazy
I get so obsessed with buying cards for
people I'm that person who buys like
multiple cards for one occasion I got
them two wedding cards but I have a
reasoning so one of the wedding cards is
more serious kind of there's more
serious one it just says pray cute like
a little ring and gold and everything on
the inside just says the best couple
ever kind of generic but then this one I
really like this one says you may now
update your relation status to married
then my other friend is pregnant I think
I've talked about that in a past vlog
yeah because I was getting her baby
present wrapping stuff I've been going
crazy with the baby clothes and
everything just actually do really soon
this one I love it says you turn mom
jeans
into bomb genes now this one is like a
sparkly diaper and it says just got
real
and I found a good card for my dad's
birthday it says have your cake in
tweeted too because he thinks he's like
the social media king now after all of
his YouTube debuts and we're gonna film
another video and I'm there too I got
some k-cups Italy and the last thing I
got is a candle I literally told myself
I was gonna go into target just to find
the card in bag and I ended up walking
around the entire store but this candle
smells amazing
this is the vanilla pumpkin Chesapeake
Bay candle mmm really nice really great
so I need to pack since I still haven't
done I've literally been sitting here on
the phone with doctors for like three
hours that I will see you guys in
California
all right so I'm in LA I just got into
our hotel room here we are don't even
have to do a room tour you can see it
all in that one shot I am freaking
starving so I just post me of course
very healthy I got buffalo wings I like
haven't eaten anything all day today in
a milkshake and then I got a side of
fries
but look at this side of fries I
literally thought it was gonna be just
like a normal small thing but my friend
is on the way so he'll probably have
some of these too we're staying in
Redondo Beach so I think we're gonna
walk down to the water and chill and
check everything out
are you recording this no okay
okay now the other way okay now give me
a little chin action not you gotta take
him to partner we're doing all that okay
here's a way you don't ya following me
yeah first of all remember to floss

after we went out for Halloween but I
was really fun we went to bar and
Ballard and actually met Ave Rito there
if you guys follow me on Instagram you
saw that I'm gonna be doing a what to
see like must-see places or views or
whatever in Seattle and I started
working on that today so Rach was
awesome and helped me shoot that we only
went to two locations to the spots I'm
gonna be talking about like six or seven
I think and it took us like five hours
we stopped to take a bunch of pictures
and stuff too but yeah I think we got
some really cool shots uh-huh

really looks like 10 leaves like came
down on you and then the last like three
hours it's now 10:00 p.m. yeah since
like 7:00 I've been finishing up this
blog that you guys are watching right

just end this off right here because
