Spokane I'm at northern quest casino I'm
so fed should be here
Julie's picking me up in a little bit
and we're going over to the progeny
share warehouse so I'm gonna get some
footage for the announcement video and
I'll probably show some in this vlog too
I'm only here for like 24 hours
literally tomorrow's a meet-up and the
spall Days event and then I fly out like
during the event so I just got a little
lunch my suitcase was so heavy because I
brought this China's bag of makeup for
Project Beauty share so that stuff that
needs to be like sanitized and
everything got my trusty target platen I
love this thing it's so soft I think
we're gonna go straight from the
warehouse to out to dinner with a couple
of the other project we do share gals so
that will be fun
I'm excited thank you to northern quest
for hosting me here it's a beautiful
room give you guys a little overview and
there's a huge shower in here
giant shower like whoa I want to show
you guys this later because this is like
the best thing I've ever bought off
Amazon
well I suppose Pittsburgh they rocket
absolutely goes I ready to go but
because of your followers
we now are giving brushes did you guys
so they have to send them pre-cleaned
right
that's the been requested clean but
there's something they're sending I'm
gently used and we are taking the time
to wash them because you can wash it
right yes so you can send deodorant has
to be new and then tampons any kind of
feminine products they're always Anita
they can cuz and not in a box alright so
when you guys send in packages this is
the table they said they get 30 packages
a week about 30 30 to 45 a week which is
amazing it's all in two openings okay
you should open one yeah okay so this is
Cynthia from Los Angeles and we keep the
addresses because they get all thank-you
notes
anything that's breakable if you pack it
maybe with just some like recycled news
people or bubble wrap or something if
you have it lying around just so stuff
doesn't break like this is glass there's
a lot of the times they get really great
stuff but it breaks so they have to kind
of sitting on the bathroom floor I just
got back to my hotel room a few minutes
ago and every time come to visit project
be sure and just see it the warehouse
and see your packages and your letters
I'm just an emotional wreck it's one
thing to hear you guys tell me that you
sent in a package or to see your tweets
or whatever but to actually see them and
see your hand and notes and everything
is it's just crazy but anyway so we did
some filming for something coming up we
went out to dinner with if you have the
project be teacher gals which is really
good we went to really good
and then Julie was the founder project
be sure she gave me this box okay
by the way we're in the bathroom because
this is the only place like decent
lighting Julie getting in this box
and inside this box this friggin tissue
paper again started crying at dinner are
so many letters and notes that you guys
have sent in with packages all from the
baby no family
I haven't read these yet I feel like I
need like a glass of wine and to be at
home and stuff when I do that because
I'm just gonna be hot mess and I read
all the ones in the project patient
warehouse but I don't realize that there
were more so this is just insane to me
but this one is from Liz shout out to
Jessica Emenike from Louisville
Louisville Louisville Kentucky Heather
from Oceanside
this is a cute one Janine from Phoenix
well favorito fam always feel beautiful
in your skin xoxo and Mandy I am so
excited to meet you guys tomorrow
it kind of hit me like a couple hours
I've only done a few meetups and I
always get really nervous for them I
don't know sometimes I feel like there's
a lot of pressure and I don't want to
let you guys down you know what I mean
like some of you if you like I've been
watching for so long that I just know if
I was watching someone for that many
years I just have like an idea in my
head and I wouldn't want to be let down
so I hope that I don't let anybody guys
down so thank you again
depression video share for taking on all
this 15 biggest foundation stuff and
everything with me it is a mean up day
I'm really excited it's actually like 12
o'clock right now I felt pretty crappy
all morning but I'm rallying I'm gonna
shower my body is not feeling great
right now but we got this we're gonna do
this still don't really know what I'm
wearing
siding between two outfits okay
I've been rushing around certain here
freaking so it's rushing around what I'm
like to play watch out almost done with
my makeup I'm down in the lobby bathroom
right now I have like 15 minutes before
I have to head over there you're like
all over the place right now I'm excited
I'm nervous on my face
all right so I'm clearly back in Seattle
I'm filming foundation Friday today so
did that this morning I just had a
chiropractor appointment with a new
doctor chiropractor basically have
arthritis in my spine and then like 10
other things there's like this really
cool thing they did with sensors where
they put sensors on all of your muscles
and basically that like color codes it
saying which muscles are totally
overworking and then obviously causing
like inflammation and flare-ups and all
that and it supposed to be like in the
white and then it goes like blue and
whatever different colors my entire
spine was read up into my neck and then
my neck on this side was black which is
like beyond beyond about basically we're
gonna do like a five-month care plan and
basically starting in February when I
get back that's gonna be a combo of
adjustments physical therapy and massage
therapy everything he was saying
completely made sense like I have so
many body issues besides my migraines
80% 90% of my migraines come from my
neck and like spine issues and the rest
is just genetic and triggers like not
enough food heat whatever which is how
my migrant started but over the years
and I think after I got anything ever
told you guys this but I got a
concussion in college and I think after
that concussion but my neck stuff got
really bad today is gonna be good day
because I feel good I'm excited I got
some holiday decor stuff mostly for the
background of my videos and stuff
because I'm gonna be gone so much that
I'm really not decorating a whole lot
but I wanted to show you guys a little
haul I went to TJ Maxx and I think I got
some stuff from Target I'm actually
gonna switch up the background of my
videos today what else I need to do some
stuff for project B to share I need to
edit need to get tonight's video
scheduled and to st. maca genes okay so
we're gonna do a little holiday haul
right so first up this is gonna be the
tree in the background of my videos how
cute is this little basis is from TJ
Maxx was $12.99 I love the little white
and gold I got a little mini
it's and ornaments and stuff I got three
pillows from TJ Maxx I'm doing a
Instagram thing with Samsung which is
really exciting and I'm gonna do like a
holiday style kind of thing and like
cute PJs and everything so I got a few
pillows put on my bed because I think
that's where I'm gonna take the photo
and they're just really cute but this
one says Mary obviously got the plaid
and then I really like the little gray
glitter this was $24.99 this one I'm
just gonna keep I think on my bed
year-round so as this like gray kind of
going through it this one's actually
Vince Camuto I didn't know Vince made
pillows learn something every day this
was 1699 and then last pillow is this
super pretty snowflake it almost has
this like taupe tan kind of thing has
some silver beading going on throughout
a this was in 1999 put this in the
background for some ambiance more k-cups
these are my favorite cake up to
starbucks dark roast red dress these
were actually from Whole Foods but I
want to show you guys because they're
very holiday in a limited edition so the
candy cane pretzel flats yogurt also
from TJ Maxx this blanket how freaking
cute is this it is very soft I kind of
feel like this might be one of those
materials that sheds which is like a pet
peeve of mine super super soft on the
inside
this was $24.99 this mug I'm in love
with how cute is this it's cute because
you can actually unbutton this to wash
the bike obviously this was $6.99 then
last thing I got at t.j.maxx these are
for the little tree and I also got other
ornaments too so on here I'm gonna put
these little cute silver disco balls I
think I'm only gonna put a few of these
these were 399 did I say that camera and
I went to Bartels if you don't live in
Washington I think part L is only in
Washington or tells us basically like
CVS or rite-aid they're just local
they're all over the place and they have
a bunch of Christmas stuff so I got
these really cute green sparkly and give
you a close-up how freaking cute are
these different shades of green and then
you have some sparkly ones and just a
metallic and I thought the sparkly would
look really cute in the background
because with the lens you only see the
stuff like kind of blurred out so if
it's Sparkle is there if there's lights
it's really all you see the ornaments
were 399 these weren't from bartels but
while we're on
I'll show you because this is what's
going on the little tree I got these off
of Amazon it actually comes with six
sets of these but it was only like eight
bucks or something I'll have everything
I can find link down below so these are
just little white fairy lights and these
I'm gonna hook around the tree and light
it up
they had peppermint crunch a Junior
Mints I'm so excited about these I feel
like I should go back and get like 500
boxes
I love Junior Mints Junior Mints are
probably one of my favorite candies like
in the top five I think Finn tea goes on
sale this super cute mug Santa upside
down
I think it's on sale for like $1.99 or
something Bart tells us having a bunch
of their Christmas stuff on sale so I
think that's everything I got oh yeah so
that went to two different stores to try
and find lights Christmas lights that
don't have the green wire because I want
it white against the white wall and
everything and I couldn't find them so I
ended up just doing Amazon one day
shipping so those are gonna get here
today
but I need those for that Instagram
photo I'm really hoping the lights get
here before the Sun Goes Down so that I
can take that photo today if not I'm
gonna take the photo tomorrow but
tomorrow's Thanksgiving and then I leave
Friday morning super early driving to
Portland and then I pick up my dad there
for our Oregon trip so it'll be really
fun I'm trying to get a bunch of
done before then I'll just get
marshmallows on the floor so let's set
up this Christmas tree thing now how
many of these I'm going to need
want to get a red candle for right there
because I realize don't have one but
here's the little tree thank you again
this will all be blurred in the
background which is why I can just leave
the lights like that I think with the
string lights I'm gonna move that and
kind of hang them down the wall a little
bit oh my god what the heck oh my god I
just realized that there's the
thermostat in here I was wondering why
this room is always freakin freezing
little heat on in here okay so I just
finished shaking doing the Instagram
samsung shoot thing which actually took
me way longer than I thought it was
gonna my friends coming over his
Thanksgiving today by the way it's the
next day I just realized I haven't you
blogged my friends coming over in like a
half hour I still have to make food I
have to change I have to clean up all
this stuff think that took me two hours
and it's gonna be one photo the lights
came in I ended up not hanging them up
because they looked cuter just like
blurred in the background kind of the
whipped cream I think I almost use an
entire can of whipped cream because it
kept melting but I think I hopefully got
a winner so what I do when I have to
take a photo of myself is just put my
camera on the tripod and then I'll just
put it on video mode so that I can just
import the footage and basically just
like save screenshot whichever one you
can put your camera on timer and I have
a remote that I use sometimes too but
that just takes photos so it's really
hard to both hide the remote and focus
on what you're doing and take like five
hundred photos so there's the little
setup and then when I say it like
focuses on me so it kind of my beliefs
described you like blur the lights and
stuff this is how many times I tried
each one of these like a half hour long
so anyways you guys will see that come
in actually that will already be up on
Instagram so I need to get my
together this is the Ardell lipstick
that I wore in the Thanksgiving makeup
tutorial and then the rest of my face I
just used the co IO foundation mixed
with dermablend smooth liquid camo Oh
yesterday I got my nails done
this is OPI shellac in Skyfall I really
like this color yesterday I didn't vlog
this is boring I was just editing all
night I woke up at like 7:30 and I'm
just been working all morning and
tomorrow I leave for organs I still have
to do a laundry and pack
never got around to doing that so my
friend who's coming over is my old
roommate the one that I'm going to
Europe with in January so we are
finishing up
aka starting planning we haven't done
anything
I usually don't really plan my trips all
I do is booked hostels and that's kind
of it when I'm on the plane or whatever
I'll just find stuff to do there that's
when I do like my research</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
