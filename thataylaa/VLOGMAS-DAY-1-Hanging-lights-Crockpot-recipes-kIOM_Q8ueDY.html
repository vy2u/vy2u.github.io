I'm not doing vlog number and I'm not
doing vlogmas but I think I think I'm
gonna try and do flog akka which is my
version of vlogmas Hanukkah so right now
it's actually the Sunday after
Thanksgiving so I think I'm going to try
and get this up on the first day of
December it's tomorrow I think it might
be tomorrow how many days are in
November who knows just to kick off the
month of vlog in vlogging why sentences
so hard right now my skin is breaking
out right now I think I'm into a face
mask I just got back from San Diego last
night for Thanksgiving and when I was
there I went to CBS obviously Southern
California drugstores are like the best
you can find they would really have all
the new stuff before anyone I think I'm
gonna do a whole haul but I got two
different face masks the first one is
the beauty 360 detoxifying this is just
like the CBS brand and then I got the
Nippon fab glycolic instant fix mask I
think I'm gonna try this CVS brand one
right now we'll see how it is so I just
got back from San Diego last night for
Thanksgiving from Thanksgiving and back
in Seattle back in my apartment super
happy to be back
couldn't find anywhere to put the phone
but that is probably the most
interesting face mask formula I've ever
tried it's on my face right now it was
like a super liquidy jello kind of
formula it just looks like my face is
dirty but it's kind of cooling which is
nice so we'll let this bad-boy dry and
see what happens I'm vlogging on my
phone right now I don't know if we're
gonna switch to the camera my camera
that I used to film is just a little bit
difficult to vlog with it just like
there's settings that you have to change
every time you turn it on so hopefully
this quality is called a hopefully this
quality is good enough I just got the
iPhone 6s by the way so that's the
camera that we're on right now I'm gonna
get a cup of coffee going I got the
Keurig
it's always weird when you come back to
your apartment after being gone for so
long I was gone for like a week so the
videos that you guys saw were
pre-recorded it's good being back home I
I don't know I think my family just does
Thanksgiving really different than a lot
of other families like it never really
feels like Thanksgiving but I am
grateful to oh this is leaking
everywhere I don't really do anything
Thanksgiving eat if that makes sense
besides like have a turkey well major
Seahawks you're going on outside right
now anyways so I've been watching a
bunch of vlogs and just I've liked the
holidays and stuff and I'm kind of
feeling like I want to put up some kind
of lights in our apartment I don't know
I feeling like I need some festivity in
this place there we go let there be
light hallelujah these bananas are
probably bad now yeah I just realized
they didn't really tell you guys how
vodka came about so let's do that I
posted on snapchat asking if you guys
would want to see some kind of vlogging
in December just with my work schedule
in life there's no way that I would be
able to vlog edit and upload every
single day of December if I didn't have
a full-time job I could do that but it's
a little bit difficult so even doing
like the eight days of vlog akka is
gonna be really challenging for me
because I'm literally gonna be filming
throughout the day if I can at work
it'll probably just be in the morning
and then after work actually yeah it
will be I'm not gonna be able to like
film in it and then editing that same
night and then doing it for eight days
in a row so we'll see I'm gonna try my
best I'm not guaranteeing every single
day I'll probably film every day and
then I might do a couple days together
you know I don't know I'm really gonna
try though
a for effort so vlog guca will be the
eight nights of Hanukkah which is
December 6 to the 14th I think I
shouldn't have that I hope you guys are
excited about that let me know actually
in the comments on this video if you
actually want to see that I don't get a
lot of people saying that they want to
do it I'm not gonna kill myself for
eight days so definitely let me know
down below if it's worth it and if I
should do it I think I might just throw
in some yoga pants and get some
decoration stuff my issue is that after
the holidays we have literally nowhere
to store it in this apart
the bananas were actually still good so
I just brought them up and put them in a
little baggie I like to freeze all the
free with specially when it's going bad
but I can put it in to a green smoothie
I don't think I have spinach right now I
just showered and got ready in that face
mask is possibly the worst face mask
I've ever used it literally just felt
like nothing washing off like it
literally just felt like I was washing
my face I probably return it if there
was a CVS by me but there's not what are
we doing here we're in the adidas
sweatshirt got some moccasins on if
you're curious on that word is so
freaking hard for me to say on my face
today I mix the cosmetics CC
illumination cream with the body shop
lightening shade adjusting drops
I'm trying these out I'm gonna have a
whole review on them coming soon what
else I'm the lipstick color pop trap
I ordered a crock pot which I'm super
excited about and I think it should be
here tomorrow so I think I'm gonna go to
the grocery store well the Seahawks game
is on because that is literally the best
time to grocery shop in Seattle I'm just
gonna look up some recipes online I
guess for crock pots and see what we can
come up with the goal is to have dinner
and lunch I spend so much money eating
out and I've been eating really crappy
lately
so I'm hoping the crock-pot game will
help me with that I think I'm gonna do
this slow cooker chicken taco soup I'll
link it down below I like to use all
recipes calm this is not sponsored or
anything but I just like how you can see
the reviews and I don't know I just like
it better than using like Pinterest or
something and this looks bomb look at
that got my list let's do this alright I
went ham at the grocery store got stuff
for the crock-pot recipe and then
necessary things I found success wake up
ourselves but I don't know I don't know
how long is our I don't know what I'm
doing and then I realized that I totally
have lights that I could hang so I might
just keep the receipt and return these
and trying to hang the ones that I have
I don't know we shall see
so these are the lights that I have from
last year that I never put up actually
spray-painted this wire white and I
think I mentioned this in blog mice like
a year ago and that I was gonna do that
but I'm probably just gonna hang those
up because it's like why waste some
money on these things about an extension
cord thing I don't think I've ever
actually hung Christmas lights myself so
this will be fun
okay this looks this looks a little bit
sad but none of them nothing right I'm
pretty sure I broke that one so I think
I'm gonna switch it out with that wool
with the one down there
 me all down I'm gonna leave the
frozen chicken out and just put it in on
top when I get the crock-pot and also
the taco seasoning but super-easy
literally just gonna freeze this and
then plop it in the crock-pot when it
comes I'm listening to like old people
Christmas music right now I just read
the directions online for slow cookers
and like thawing meat and it says that
you do want to thaw your meat before you
put it in the slow cooker so basically
the night before you want to put this
bag in the slow cooker you should add
your meat in and thigh in the
refrigerator so in the morning it'll be
a thawed this is just frozen chicken
breast that I got at Safeway I'm gonna
put three of these in that bag and these
are currently frozen so we'll put all
this in the fridge and then it should be
good to go
tomorrow decided to make a green
smoothie so I have the frozen banana in
there a little bit of coconut cream err
this is like my secret smoothie
ingredient this dump is amazing makes it
taste like a milkshake a little bit of
milk
spinach - I already say that and then
some peanut butter so we shall see how
this tastes I use the Magic Bullet it is
amazing I love it let's do this is this
so bomb tastes like a straight-up
milkshake hell yeah so I just picked off
all of my chillax whoops
I know that's super bad to do but I was
just watching a super intense episode of
Prison Break and it just happened I'm
gonna pay my nails with get this this is
the smithing cult lovers creep
interesting name face is looking real
oily right now I've literally just been
sitting on the couch for the last like 4
hours watching Prison Break
feels so frickin good to just relax and
not do anything
it's 10:00 p.m. at night I just finished
watching Prison Break and it's getting
so good I've actually watched all of the
seasons but I forget everything so I'm
just re watching it I'm gonna get ready
for bed I have work in the morning
hopefully you guys are excited for vlog
