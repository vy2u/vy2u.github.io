juice but I figured I would start
blogging today because I'm actually
driving to the snow today so excited
it's like an hour away we're going to a
place called gold
he's called gold Creek pond she's like
an hour away from Seattle I just did my
makeup I look very washed out right now

different lipsticks I'm gonna bring this

is coming then also my friend who's a
photographer is coming so we're gonna
take a bunch of photos in the snow and I
have a couple different outfit changes

very prime right now looking good
this is just gluten-free toasties and
then I put on the cow cheese and the
blue thing and then some avocado
this is outfit number one I've outfit
number two and there and I think I'm
agreeing with that jacket to you so I
think this is gonna be like a combined
vlog and probably just gonna vlog today
and then I have a couple days until I
leave for LA which I'll tell you guys
about later but I'm super excited and
then go straight from LA to San Diego
for a week to visit my family I have a
 ton of work I've to get done before
I leave them so I'm probably not gonna
blog the next two days so here's the
first lipstick color I just made really
overlined my lips but this is the
Smashbox always on initiate what is this
got a light
I think this
I've never left before look at me
blogging mom
so I made it snow Bullock Creek pond
trying to debate it I'm here Sarah
we're trying to decide if we want to
attempt to walk to this pond we're both
in jeans smart oh very smart or if we
just wanna park here
we have the photo is this didn't reach
here actually we just like jumpier we're
making us fo hot chocolate right now
this is what goes on behind Instagram
that is
for some in your mouth now hot chocolate
decorator right here
it is the next day just got my blood
drawn for accutane that was such a
show they lost my lab slip it's supposed
to be like on file for every single time
so I waited an hour and then I drove
over to the dermatologist had to get a
new one had them fax it basically the
whole thing took like two and a half
hours but it's all good I got my blood
drawn got an egg breakfast sandwich and
some coffee and now I am getting my
brain working fasting as a rough dude I
took an image shock this morning in my
head with fasting it does not go well I
need to go return something I think I'm
gonna do that right now just get it all
the way then I'm gonna come back and
film and edit that is that so here's my
skin by the way at 2:00 almost two
months you guys will be seeing a 2 month
update I'm super excited because I'm
gonna be ordering the new lens and it's
the Sigma I don't think I see it
it's a sigma 18 a 35-millimeter it's
supposed to be amazing has zoom in this
a little bit wider angle and the videos
the N photos I've seen on that look
great it's time to upgrade you know I am
off sending in my quarterly taxes don't
forget your taxes people exes are very
fun I actually really enjoy it I'm
really into financial stuff I feel like
if I had a second life I would be an
interior designer and if I had a third
life I would want to be like an
accountant or a financial adviser or
something so I'm back from doing returns
and I decided I'm gonna try and film 2
videos today since I feel good so I'm
gonna do my youth obvious bro my top
holiday red liquid lipsticks
and I think I'm gonna do a comparison
actually I don't know which one will be
it but I'm gonna film a second one you
guys will see what it is I think this
one will be up before this vlog goes up
so did my top red liquid lipsticks and I
also filmed a sponge comparisons if
those are up a link them down below but
my scarf I got off of Amazon and then
the shirt is from Express a while ago
pro tip if you want to be extra
productive wear running shoes around the
house I swear it works is this the next
day I just started feeling better like
two hours ago it's four o'clock right
now three three o'clock my things and I
were off
I basically was having a horrible puking
really bad migraine and since 6:00 a.m.
this morning I feel okay because I took
two pills and the shot you just gave
yourself a shot
yeah not a fun night we have a bar full
down there really classy need to clean
up my apartment I still need to pack I
still need to get a ton of editing
done since I basically lost today but
I'm just hoping that this stays off and
I can get some stuff done I have to head
to the chiropractor right now and then I
leave super early in the morning I was
hoping to film like a huge try on haul
video today but this is why I
pre-recorded I am working on just
packing everything up I got most of my
suitcase done all of my clothes and
stuff is under here I just started using
packing cubes and I'm kind of digging it
I never used to use packing cubes over
there I have a bunch of gifts and stuff
for people because we're gonna be
celebrating Hanukkah in San Diego so I
want to show you guys how I pack my
filming stuff because I'm gonna be
bringing my good camera this time
usually when I travel I'll just bring my
normal vlog camera I think I'm gonna
film a an actual video so I'm gonna
bring this so if you do photography or
film or anything this backpack I got it
off Amazon a while ago now probably a
year ago it's awesome for traveling with
because one it doesn't look super
obvious that you're kidding around like
thousands of dollars or the camera gear
in here it just looks like a backpack
but it unzips down on this half and you
have a camera section under here that's
padded and then this part unzips and you
have a perfect spot for your laptop back
here which is super nice it's also
padded and then this is happens to be
like a perfect little slip for my other
camera bringing this little vlog camera
it's like an action cam 4k like the
GoPro but better I like it better right
here I just have some batteries for it
the waterproof casing extra
mic battery and this is the road might
go I don't usually put my videos with
this I use the road mic Pro but this is
an awesome one to travel with because it
just plugs straight in and sticks right
on top of the camera and then I have
this light that's awesome this is like
probably one of my must-haves travel
video stuff I got this off of Amazon
super easy you just charge the battery
it lasts pretty long and the cool thing
about this is that it's basically like
an on-the-go super bright studio light
but you can actually change the Kelvin
which just changes like the temperature
and you can change the brightness you
can just adjust the lighting depending
on where you are super cool so have all
its stuff linked down below and also you
can put this on a little tripod if you
wanted to I bring my external hard drive
because my computer gets full every
single time I edit this is flat so often
on the table that it now has like a been
weird here's what we're working with so
this is just kind of rolled up back here
cleaner is back here I'll stick my
laptop back there tonight wallet will be
added in and I think we're good to go
alright guys so I just got into LA it's
like 5:30 right now and I'm in Malibu
and I'm so excited I'm actually here
with elf cosmetics well I've got some
intense went back there which is just so
cool and mind-blowing because elf woods
literally won the first makeup brands I
ever used and you guys know I'm a fan of
them so I was just so excited that they
asked me to come out here and we're at
this place called Calamigos ranch in
Malibu it is so cute we each have our
own little like cottage thing I'm gonna
give you guys a little room tour I gotta
get ready by the way we have like fancy
dinner thing and literally an hour but I
want to show you this room so you walk
in huge TV this goes back like three
things and look at these cute little
ceilings it's like a little cabin and we
got a marble bar card over here this is
like my dream floor right here I need to
get in here and then here's the bedroom
this is so cute so I'm here tonight
tomorrow is like a full day of
shenanigans with them and then I leave
Friday morning today's Wednesday
and then I'm gonna take the train from
here
to San Diego for like five days to spend
with my family but thank you to elf for
having me out here I'm so excited and
they put a little goodie bag actually it
I'll show you guys that stuff later
because I actually have to get ready
right now all right so I've been
watching a shark tank getting ready I
have to head over there but here's my
outfit so here's my outfit I have on
this like dark green dress from fashion
Nova watches Henry London shoes I think
we're from Nordstrom Rack and ready to
go
your hands and I know that I think a lot
that's a lot of work
and we are here to help you guys do what
you want to do to continue to grow
continue to inspire and continue to just
build a community that is passionate
about
things that are getting
all right so it's now the next day this
is like our full day of activities and
things and last night was super fun I
didn't realize it was gonna be like a
full-on holiday party so there's like 10
or 15 of us maybe here staying at the
hotel like from out of town
and the last night at the dinner there
was a bunch of like local people that
came other bloggers and stuff we were
supposed to have like a pizza bar thing
outside but it's hella windy right now
so we're actually doing lunch inside
right now now we're having like a
brainstorm session some group activities
I think we're gonna be talking about
some of their new products and just like
giving feedback and stuff so it should
be fun I'm gonna bring you guys along in
this top I got at Macy's I'm wearing my
normal silver hoops from Amazon I still
need to put on lipstick and brush my
teeth but we're stuck Calamigos ranch
and they have all these like little
cottages that we're all in
trying to get a second wind I have 50
minutes until the last event of the
night which is dinner today was super
fun the paint thing was so cool they had
this graffiti artist come in and we
basically got to like graffiti or like
spray paint slash paint this whole ELF
sign the whole day has been like back to
back back and I slept a total of like
three hours last night so I'm feeling it
this is about as good as we're gonna get
tonight just a super basic no eyeliner
anything makeup this is Malory 1712 1712
shot necklace this one was from boohoo
this shirt off the shoulder forever 21 I
want to say then this lipstick is one of
the ones that I showed on snapchat that
I'm super excited about this is the
metallic crown in magnetic mauve these
are launching soon this is like one of
the things we got to preview today
look at this shade feel super
comfortable in the lips do like how
there's a beautiful hotel and we're most
amused by the blue spider okay like I've
only been vlogging like in this corner
of the bathroom but that's pretty much
where you can see my face I just got
back from dinner it was super nice and
the VP of Marketing just gave this
really nice toast and it's just
refreshing when a brand recognizes
people that have followed their brand
and have loved and use their products
for so many years just cool when brands
really value that no matter what the
size refreshing the sea and it was just
a really great group of people we didn't
just get to see the new products but we
got to actually tell them like give them
feedback on past products and things
that we wanted to see obviously I talked
a lot about foundation shades and doing
like Leitner's and dark nurse which
would be awesome from them thank you so
much to all for having me here it's cool
because these kind of trips get you
thinking in a different way like
sometimes with YouTube you can get so
sucked into just being in your room and
filming and like popping out content
though I think there are gonna be some
cool things coming this year we will see
oh we gotta be me most important note of
the night so I'm not sure how much of
San Diego I'm gonna vlog like always I
like to keep
some stuff private and just not show
everyone and everything so I think I'm
just gonna enjoy time with my family
alright so I'm back in Seattle have been
here for about a day now yeah they do
I just film two videos I think when this
vlog goes up this video will be already
up this is the New Year's Eve makeup
look I also film 2017 favorites so I
basically have three days here now and
then I leave for basically like all
January pretty much sure though North
Carolina and then I'm come back here for
two days just to get my blood work done
for accutane and then I go to Europe so
I'm super excited these next few days
are like major crunch time because I'm
trying to get two to three videos done a
day so that I still have three videos a
week going up so so I'm doing haven't
really slept I just wanted to wrap up
this vlog here because I'm going to need
to start editing this and I think I have
a lot of footage so this will probably
already be a long vlog but if you guys
enjoy blogs and you want them to
continue make sure you give this a
thumbs up I really appreciate it if
you're new here you can join the baby to
a family and subscribe if you're already
buried oh don't forget to turn on the
bail notifications it'll notify you when
I post a new video I love you guys
thanks for watching see you my next
