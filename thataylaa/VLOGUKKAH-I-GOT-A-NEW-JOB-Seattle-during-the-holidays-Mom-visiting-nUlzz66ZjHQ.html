currently at my and my mom's Airbnb
they're in town from California so we're
gonna be doing fun Seattle things it is
freaking pouring right now what's the
mama here who knows so we're just taking
a break inside maybe I'll show you guys
a little tour of their Airbnb I'm taking
the next couple days kind of off of work
I'm like going in in the morning and
then doing stuff with them in the
afternoon we're gonna be just even good
to do in Seattle stuff they're on a walk
right now so maybe I'll show you guys a
quick tour so here's the living room
look at that chandelier it's not pretty
they had like a water leakage situation
over there so that's why the rug is up
here's the living room this fireplace is
so legit you guys it's an electronic
fireplace and it heats up like the
entire house and then here's a little
bar area at kitchen super pretty super
nice like these floors I love these
floors too I think they're like laminate
wood I don't think the real one and then
this backsplash how cute is this we just
sent to Trader Joe's and got some snacks
for later when they get back from their
walk free cheese I think's a mound rate
some cheddar cheese my aunt is like
genius at picking out good cheese oh my
got this bottle of wine let me know what
your guys favorite red blends are and
then these are bomb I've mentioned these
in blog before but these are the
broccoli florets from Trader Joe's and
they're so freakin good
I just got an apple to cut up and some
grapes - what is this Oh
crackers I just posted on Instagram I
don't think I ever finished like the
clip from yesterday but I went to the
car place and finalized everything drove
away with my Jeep it just drives so nice
in Seattle Seattle is like super frickin
hilly so it feels good to be able to
actually like stop on a hill and not
have your car like slide down the hill
really safe yeah let me know down below
what you guys think I should name it
someone commented snow white and I
really like that it's all white all
inside of the picture right here
I paid for everything on my own but I
feel like this is my first big-girl
purchase going to Rock Creek tonight for
dinner which if you're in Seattle it's
like a famous seafood place supposed to
be really good what else can we talk
about last night I went to edit the
first vlog and it totally cut out all of
the audio and that's happened to me
before and I basically have to do it
this whole other way of importing the
footage that just takes it for a new
year and a half so I'm gonna try and do
that tonight
you
all right so it is Thursday I just got
home from work so my mom and my aunt
left this morning this is gonna be such
a freaking random mix of clips now that
it's Thursday I can tell you guys as I
know this video won't be going up before
Friday but I am super excited to share
that I got a new job my last day at my
current job is tomorrow Friday the 11th
I actually have a good amount of chunk a
good amount of trunk I actually have a
good amount of time off before I start
my new job I don't start till the new
year so grateful for my whole experience
at my last job that was my first job out
of college and it was just amazing I
worked with incredible people and I'm
forever thankful for that experience but
I'm super excited for this new job I'm
working at an agency I'm obviously not
gonna say which one or anything like
that yeah I think it'll be really good
and I'm really excited so over the last
like month month and a half I've been
interviewing and going through that
whole process which is why the videos
have been a little sparse lately just
super stressful when you go through that
I got there was three or four separate
interviews for it it's just a lot on top
of YouTube and drop I was rd work again
I revealed smoky palette comparison to
the Urban Decay Naked smokey is up so
leave that down below if you want to
watch it I think this vlog will be going
up next basically was trying to edit
this and import it all the footage from
my iPhone and I don't know why but when
you import iPhone footage into iMovie
sometimes it gets like super
high-pitched so I'm basically having to
read and pour all of the footage onto my
new computer I got a new MacBook Air
right here I haven't even taken it out
of the box yet but I think I'm gonna do
that right now and start trying to use
iMovie on this version actually left my
work computer at work on accident so
it's good motivation to use that so I
can get the video up yeah new computer
else is new oh I was going to show you
guys a haul mini haul of stuff that I
got with my mom and my aunt and also
some of this I ordered online so ordered
this dress online from Black Friday this
is from Lulu's I love Lou's they have
really nice like high quality stuff and
it's really reasonably priced this is a
dress and it kind of goes out right here
and it just fits really cute I think
there's like a
I think up the neck kind of thing in the
back so I figured that'd be good for
like a holiday party or something I
think I have some clips in the mall that
we went to but that was just Bellevue
square if you're familiar with the
Seattle area I got a new bra this is my
favorite this is my favorite bra style
from Victoria's Secret I think it's
their padded Demi t-shirt push-up
something
what is this okay padded perfect
coverage I have like four of these bras
and they just fit perfectly they give
you some nice look but they don't feel
like super push-up so I got this scarf
at forever 21 which is like a poop brown
color but it's like weirdly appealing to
me this is only seven dollars I thought
this would look cute with like knee-high
boots I'm gonna start posting some more
outfit of the days on Instagram because
we moved our mirror into this hallway
now and so you can actually get a
full-length shot no good sucks and
there's light so yay whoa where's the
mic where's the button I was just gonna
have the dramatic moment where I turned
it on and they can't find the button Oh
that as dramatic as you anticipated
getting some videos done and trying to
figure out this new computer not sure
how this whole vlog repair thing is
breaking down but it might be two
separate vlogs who knows we'll see if
you guys like this and you want to see
more vlogs give it a thumbs up so I know
love you guys thanks for watching see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
