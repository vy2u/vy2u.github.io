and just wanted to show you guys some
stuff that's really freaking exciting
look at these mini colour-pop liquid
lipsticks look at how freakin cute these
are I feel like if they made mini
everything people would just have to buy
it all how do you resist that these
would be really good stocking stuffers
because they're so small I'm really
excited to try out this highlight trio
from City color I don't know if that's
picking it up on this camera but that
middle shade it looks beautiful looks
super light and then this one looks kind
of like my dupe that highlight this is a
glow Pro oh wait I think this is just
the matte black palette and this is the
shimmer blush palette from City color
they send these eyeshadows and i
swatched a few of them and they're
really pretty actually this the
consistency is beautiful I think I'm
into a Instagram post showing some
swatches don't know what these are
highlighting things or eyeshadow
highlighting wand oh it's kind of
exciting not a huge fan of like liquid
highlighting products just because I
don't want to don't want to have to deal
with like the powder liquid on top of
powder situation in buy time this video
is up this water to be on Instagram
revealed smoky palette by Coastal Scents
this is supposed to be like a dupe of
the Urban Decay Naked smokey obviously
then you have the Real Techniques set
and then there's a bunch of stuff in
here which I'm really excited to try out
amazing their face masks right now and
so far I really like it this is the acne
treatment mask these high light bronzer
things just try out whatever in a shadow
and shoes what else I got these polaroid
zip photo printer from Erin Condren
actually I had a bunch of credit on
there so I used it buy this and I also
got my mom one so I hope it's good it's
gonna give it to her for the holidays
I'm pretty sure you can Prentis like
directly from your phone which is really
cool so I'm double masking it up right
now I have the acne treatment mask from
Oprah cosmetics on my acne spots and I
put the origins
what is this one called I don't even
know let's see the origins clear
improvement charcoal mass this is like
one of my favorite mass I love this
thing
this is really great clearing out the
pores okay so these are probably just
gonna be like random clips in this vlog
I just finished filming words I just
finished filming this look I used the
revealed smoky palette the color pop
colored liner which I haven't tried yet
and I don't know why by even though I'm
right in front of a window the lighting
is like not that great you took a bunch
of photos for Instagram what I usually
do is when I film I take like tons of
photos of products and selfies for the
week for Instagram since I can't do it
while I work so I just like pre edit all
of them and get them ready to post and
then just post it when I feel like it
I'm freaking hungry I think I'm gonna
get a burrito but I really don't feel
like leaving the house I might be ultra
lazy and postmates sit supposed to go
into work today but I ended up staying
home because I have so many videos that
I'm behind on so I took the day off and
I'm just doing YouTube stuff I have
another one or two more videos I'm gonna
film and then I'm gonna start editing
all of them I think post made saying
it's gonna happen I think I have a $10
off your first delivery on post mates
but they basically deliver anything for
you like literally anything you could
get makeup delivered if you want to do
that's like a whole new level but I am
gonna be going to my second bar class
later which is freaking intense I woke
up three times last night because I
would roll over and my app would start
cramping I think I like pulled a muscle
or something in one of my whatever's
under your ribs I think those are ABS
right yeah the things on the side
haven't been able to locate my abs for
about a year now so good to know they're
still in there somewhere so I'm gonna be
doing that with my friend later tonight
so I'm gonna try and get all this done
before 5 o'clock importing footage from
the look I just filmed and I'm about to
eat Taco Time it was excited so excited
this is what heaven looks like I'm just
chillin editing that video that I just
filmed and I don't think I'm gonna go to
bar today because I've had this weird
like I think I pulled the muscle under
my ripped I talked about this earlier
remember it actually like hurts like it
feels kind of bruised which is strange
so I don't think bar is in the cards
today I do want to work out so I might
do I might just run on like the
treadmill
a rebel rage you know vlog missus
all right so it is Sunday and I am in my
new car right now what the heck it's a
Jeep Wrangler
and I'm so excited about it sometimes it
feels freakin good to work your ass off
and then treat yourself you know I'm
saying I'm getting a super healthy
breakfast right now consisting of
chicken nuggets and orange juice from
McDonald's Cheers kind of noises that
bird
you
our yesterday in Seattle finance
department was backed up like three
hours and so they let me drive the Jeep
home so I could make it to the concert
and now I have to drive back out to the
dealership today so I can actually like
pay for it and do all the finance stuff
it still feels so surreal like I can't
believe I'm driving a Jeep right now and
it's mine what love the way drives I
feel like so high up off the ground I
still fist it on a pillow in my car
short people problems while we're having
a little chat kind of got too ambitious
about vlogging I think I really don't
know how I'm gonna vlog every single day
for eight days because of work and also
because it's the same week that my aunt
my mom are coming into town I just don't
want to have to worry about like editing
when I should be spending time with them
so I think what I'm going to do is
basically do a big compilation is that a
word
compilation yeah I'm going to compile a
bunch of different clips into probably
like two or three blogs through vlog
okay
there's seat warmers in here it's legit
I'm gonna go so I can drive to the
dealership and use the GPS Oh site now I
used the YSL Fusion ink foundation today
which I kind of forgot about it I found
on my drawer and it's just so freakin
easy to put on let me see if I can get
better light there that's a little bit
better lighting just looks super natural
it goes on way better if you put
moisturizer on underneath but I'm liking
it I kind of forgot about this I just
painted my nails and I am in love with
how they turned out is this drill at
polish which is this Florence and I
really like the formula of jewel
polishes they're super opaque and then I
put the Milani glitter over top to color
statement Lian I really like the color
statement uh sunset lipsticks i really
like the color statement al polishes -
that's the shade and then finish it off
with some julep top coat this is the
first time I've tried this top coat I
guess this goes really well with their
nail polish I don't like it I feel very
wintery and festive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
