to get this kind of soft pink flirty
Valentine's Day look using mostly
drugstore products is that's why it's
singles Awareness Day for me okay so I'm
gonna start off by priming my eyes like
always with Mac's painterly paint-pot
I'm gonna use this as a base all over
the lid up to the brow bone and then
also run this along my bottom lash line
so to start off I'm using a soft brown
color from the edge Judy's time palette
this has been my absolute favorite
blending color this is a drugstore but
it's super inexpensive you can get it on
BH Cosmetics calm all of the info and
products and brushes and everything will
be down below but I'm using a morphe
brush just to blend that in and now
we're gonna tape off the corners this is
a really easy way to get a clean and
precise line so for all the eyeshadows
we're gonna be using this wet and wild
palette that is like I think $4.99 or
something crazy like that from the
drugstore and we're starting off with
this shimmery pink color and I'm putting
this all over the lid with my finger
because it gives it more pigmentation if
you use your finger rather than like a
shader brush and then going in with a
small blending brush from morphe and
then this color right here in the
palette I'm going to place this kind of
the outer V blend it in we just want to
deepen up the crease with this color
then I'm using this deeper burgundy
color from the palette on an elf shader
brush basically any kind of firm brush
you have we're focusing this mostly on
the outer V and blending it a little bit
forward but not nearly as far as we did
that other deep burgundy color and I'm
using that morphe blending brush again
without any product on it I'm just
cleaning up all the edges and blending
everything together and then going in
with that same soft brown color again
from the edge duties time ballot I'm
blending that again in the crease and
then taking this light brow bone shade
we're placing this directly under the
brow bone who would have thought I'm
also gonna put that same color in our
inner corner just to brighten up the eye
and then once you've done that you can d
tape right here and look at that line is
not just beautiful
taking a super small C brush and the
soft brown color from the in Judy's time
palette I'm running this on my bottom
lash line and then we're gonna do the
same thing with this deeper purple shade
from the palette mainly focusing on the
outer half of the eye
and then to line the eyes I'm using my
favorite L'Oreal super slim liner and
this is amazing especially if you're a
beginner with liner and the tape is also
a really great trick because as you can
see I'm just literally following that
exact line that we created with the tape
and then putting liner over it to make
the eyes appear bigger I'm using NYX
jumbo eye pencil in milk on my waterline
and that is everything for the eyes now
we're doing bronzer which I clearly need
to buy more of so for this I'm just
putting in bronzer in the hollows of my
cheeks and then on top of my forehead to
warm up the whole face for blush I'm
using NYX blush in peach and this is a
really pretty soft pinky peach color and
this has been my favorite brush lately
this is more it gives you a really
flawless airbrushed kind of look
especially if you're using more of a
pigmented blush and then for a highlight
I'm using my favorite highlighter
mary-lou manizer by the balm and we're
just placing this above the blush on the
top of your cheekbones I also like to
put this down the bridge of my nose and
then in my t-zone just because I am
wearing a matte foundation and I like to
add a little bit more dimension to my
face this is totally up to you do it or
don't do it
for lips I'm throwing it back to Revlon
lip butters I'm using the color gumdrop
this is like purpley pink shade super
moisturizing
and then just on the center of my lips
I'm using Revlon's lipgloss in peach
Bellini if you just put this on the
center is gonna make your lips to look
more plump in full and this is it I hope
