this gothic vampy butterfly makeup
tutorial I also DIY de Halloween costume
the wings are from Party City which I
would not recommend because they like to
be parallel to the floor of the tutu I
got off of Amazon and then the corset is
from adore me which I'm freakin in love
with they do sell Halloween costumes on
there but I just kind of DIY it mine and
put it together on my own I'm just in
love with this lace I think it's so
pretty I'll leave a link to adore me
down below you guys should check it out
because they have tons of Halloween
costume I'm super excited about this
look so I hope you guys like it if you
do give it a thumbs up and if you want
to see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching
all right we are starting with a blank
canvas
pinning back to the hair got the
caffeine and we're ready to go all the
products I'm using will be listed down
below like always but I'm just starting
out with a liquid eyeliner you want to
choose one that has a really fine point
and that's easy to control so I'm taking
a card this is gonna give us a super
clean line without trying at all it's
great you want to place the card
directly up from the corner of your eye
it's up to you how far out you want to
go I didn't want a super super intense
wing for this look so this is what I did
and then you just want to do your best
to make the other side as even as
possible then we're we're gonna do
taking that same eyeliner is start
almost to the top of that point and just
drag it over so we're creating this kind
of diamond shape it's okay if the liner
goes inside it because you're gonna be
filling it in anyways but you want to
make sure the outside lines are as clean
as possible work with your eye shape but
I'm basically putting it directly in my
crease so you can see when I open my eye
it's not above that fold then you're
gonna completely fill it in halfway to
your eye and I'm just using the other
Milani eyeliner for this just because
it's quicker but use whatever you have
getting a good shape is all just
practice if you're gonna be wearing this
look for Halloween I would maybe test it
out a few times before and before you
wash your face at night just play around
with your eyeliner and see what shape
works for your eye we're taking a black
kohl liner and I'm just rubbing this all
over the lid we're gonna go in with a
brush afterwards and blend it out again
you want to make sure this doesn't go
above the fold of your crease if you
don't know where your crease is you can
either look down and see where your eye
bone is or what you can do is open your
eye and make a little mark right where
your eyelid meets your eye bone if that
makes sense
going in with this Sedona lace brush
just to kind of disperse the product and
blend it around this is gonna help serve
as a base for all the colors that we're
putting on top of it and for all of the
shadows pretty much in this look we're
using the Urban Decay vice palette if
you have any similar colors go for it
this is just what I had and is that
upside down yet was we're gonna start by
taking beat down which is this dark blue
dark purple color and I'm just putting
this right where that liquid liner me
the pencil liner and just tapping that
on we're gonna do the same thing on the
other side obviously I decided that I
wanted to blend the crease a little bit
before we put other colors on top just
because it can kind of make it muddy
sometimes so I'm going in with bitter
from the vice palette and mostly just
blending this towards the front of my
eye I kind of want to leave that tail
end of the liner blank
I'm packing on 1985 which is a fuchsia
color in the middle of my eye and
blending it into that blue color the key
to this look is just making sure all
those colors are blended into each other
then I'm taking color pop flamingo and I
don't know why the shade is called
flamingo but we're putting this on the
inner third part of my eye and I'm not
bringing this down to the lower lash
line at all I'm just keeping this right
in that inner corner this says are
really pretty sparkle to it and it just
looks really good on top of this black
then we're going back in with bitter
which is this warm brown shade which I
actually really like and I'm blending
this on the bottom lashline all over
just blend away go for it I found this
Jordana cat eyeliner in the shade orchid
in my drawer and it's actually really
pretty we're putting this on the bottom
lash line and then also putting this
right on the center of the eye sounds
weird but it works we're gonna be
packing on another eye shadow on top of
this and it just really makes it pop
like whoa look at that blue you can
change whatever color this is depending
on your outfit or whatever color you
want more of you could add pink on top
of here you could add whatever your
feeling I am packing on this shadow with
my finger when the liner is still wet
this is just gonna help give it this
super super metallic look which is
really exciting going back in with 1985
on my finger and we're putting this
between the blue and the purple just to
blend again again use whatever colors
that you want but just make sure that
they're blended into each other you want
to try to keep the wing all black
throughout this whole process if you get
a little shadow on it it's fine just go
back over it with the liner and now I'm
putting white waterline white eyeliner
on my waterline there we go
and then blending that dark blue shade
that we started with on the outer third
just to kind of smoke it out I'm taking
this Lucy beauty it's actually a face
highlighter but I'm putting this on my
inner corner and
look at that freaking blue this gives a
prettiest like mermaidy
fairy blue shade and we're also gonna
use this later on our face as a
highlight this is beautiful if you have
pale skin and I feel like this is a
super unique color going in with some
liquid liner I'm running this right on
my lash line just doing a super thin
line and it's time for the face we're
gonna go in with the cosmetics my
sculpted face palette one of my
favorites and I'm just contouring and
sculpting out the cheekbones a little
bit I did go back in with one of the
darker shades because I wanted a little
bit more of a warm look to the face and
I'm just putting this on my temples and
then we're gonna go back in with that
Luke see Beauty highlight and I believe
this is in the shade Luna but it'll be
linked down below and look at this the
camera wasn't even really picking up how
crazy or a Dessen blue this is if you
want to feel like a mermaid at all times
pick up that highlight thanks for going
in with the pure minerals blush the wet
and wild one to my right is a cheaper
option and we're just putting this on
the apples of her cheeks it gives a
super pretty rosy pink glow and this
isn't super pigmented so it's easy to
blend out I'm applying some mascara to
our lashes before we pop on some falsies
just to cover our natural lashes and
falsies are completely up to you whether
you want to wear them or not but here
are two options these socialised vixen
and House of lashes know oh my lash what
are these chip oh my lash love speaks
lashes these are super intense you
definitely could probably fly away with
these I love them though I feel like it
completes the eye look and I'm just
blending in my natural lashes and then
we're applying some bottom mascara my
favorite went wild make a length amazing
and we're just really coating these
coated up ladies for lips I'm trying out
the anastasia beverly hills midnight
liquid lipstick this is the first liquid
lipstick i've tried from i liked it
it does feel definitely more
moisturizing than the color pop ones but
it is really liquidy so it can kind of
move around easily when you're trying to
apply it that is everything i hope you
