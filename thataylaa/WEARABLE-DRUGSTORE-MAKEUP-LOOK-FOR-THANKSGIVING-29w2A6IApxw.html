would be catastrophic
all right so today we're doing
Thanksgiving makeup I already have
Christmas decor ready to go I'm just
waiting to switch up my background over
here but I wanted to do a look for you
guys for Thanksgiving that isn't super
overboard or like smokey eye that you
can just wear with your family you don't
have to wear false lashes obviously you
do you I wanted to do something that was
festive but still wearable and
affordable of the products they used
today are from the drugstore or Ulta but
happy turkey day eat your hearts out
spend it with people you love and an
exciting announcement video is actually
coming tomorrow Tuesday it's a bonus
video so at my normal upload time 6 p.m.
Pacific time there'll be a bonus video
going up I'm really excited I'm excited
for you guys to see I hope you guys are
excited if you're new here you can join
the baby radio family and subscribe but
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time should I say 6 p.m.
Pacific time again so if you're excited
for this video and you enjoy while
you're watching don't forget to give it
a thumbs up let's do this alright so
I've already washed moisturize and now
we are going to prime my face so I'm
gonna use the Revlon Photoready pore
reducing primer this is one of my
favorite primers this is a primer that I
feel like actually minimizes your pores
every primer says that but this one I
feel like actually does and it's from
the drugstore and it's pretty great so
I'm just gonna focus this kind of on the
areas where I have larger pores which is
around my nose so I just Pat this in
just like snooze everything out and kind
of fills it in you don't have my scarf
on right now cuz I went a little crazy
with the heater and my apartment is like
a furnace right now I don't even know
how I'm wearing this sweater actually I
might need to take this off I'm like
starting to it's alright so for
foundation to drugstore foundations I've
been really feeling lately you guys
probably guess to buy CYO this is the
lifeproof foundation this is a more
matte foundation this is their matte
foundation I have videos using both of
these but I'm actually gonna mix these
two today this one is way too dark this
is the lightest shade 203 and this one
is the right shade but it's just quite
not enough what that's just not quite
enough coverage for what I want right
now so I'm gonna mix the two this one to
add coverage this one to lighten it and
give it more of a dewy look this is
extremely matte but it looks pretty much
airbrush so if you have darker skin than
I do you could wear that one on its own
if you just like a matte foundation the
only
few shades right now just kind of
you but they're new so they'll probably
be expanding just mixing it on the back
of the bath and Bodyworks candle lid so
i've dampened this Real Techniques
diamond sponge so I'm just gonna try
this out with this today this thing is
so large when I'm filming this today it
is actually my one yeah tonight's my
last pill so it'll be 30 days on
accutane so far so pitch that my skin
looks like after a month for those of
you want a little chicken I said I'm
gonna do a two Munchak in and then the
three month video will be the skin care
products I'm using just so I can have
enough time to kind of test everything
out make sure what I'm using is actually
helping the dryness right now my dryness
is not bad but tomorrow I double the
dose I don't really like this one wanted
to give it another go because I haven't
used it in a while it feels kind of
rough or something like the bottom of it
I really like the LA girl sponge just as
a couple bucks i if you can find it pick
that one up or just a normal orange Real
Techniques sponge over this one okay we
are all foundation DUP so for under-eye
concealer one of my favorites is a
Maybelline and not in say drawing fit me
concealer this is in the shade 1515 is
actually lighter than 10 this one
depending on kind of what foundation
shade I'm wearing and what I mix can
look a tad dark but I think with this
one right now it'll be fine yeah this
one since it is a little bit creamier I
kind of like to give this like 10
seconds to just sit there before I start
blending just so you get a little bit
better coverage and it's not kind of
moving around quite as much so I'm just
gonna let that say I'm gonna blend out
my eyes and then go ahead and blend this
out this concealer sits on the skin so
beautifully it's very lightweight so to
set my under eyes I always mix these two
Physicians Formula powders this is just
the correcting powder in the shade
translucent if you have more fair skin
than I do you can just use this one it's
an awesome pale setting powder for under
your eyes if not you can mix it with
this or just mix it with another powder
cannot tell you how many of these I've
gone through over the years you could
also use this as an all-over face powder
if you wanted to I'm just gonna use a
tiny bit of this right here so when I go
to blend out my bronzer to smooth blend
nothing sticking so I'm not gonna set
the rest of my face if you have oily
skin one of my favorite drugstore
powders is maybelline fitme 0-5 loose
finishing powder this stuff is awesome I
love this better so I'm going to prime
my eyes with the essence - and one
eyeshadow primer this is basically like
a pigmented kind of base gives you a
little bit of color I don't like this
as much as my Mac Paint Pot for a couple
bucks it works
I do you want to remember the NYX milk
jumbo stick thing everyone used to use
my nails are way too long to function
right now I need to get them cut like
what's going on so for brows I really
like the Ardell kind of dip brow thing
this is really similar to the Anastasio
dip brow I have the shade medium brown
which is a tad light for me but we're
gonna go ahead and use it and I'm gonna
go over it with my Ulta brow tint and
deep which I love just kind of deepen it
up add some color but this is just gonna
give me a little bit more shape so
taking the Ulta brow gel I'm just gonna
run this on kind of like the outer half
of my brows this stuff is great by
itself too good to go bronzer for
bronzer I'm gonna take the elf bronzer
palette I really like this shade which
is not the lightest shade this one is
lighter but I find that this one is a
little bit more of the tone that I like
personally I kind of use bronzer and
contour shades interchangeably just for
whatever I'm in the mood for if I want
more of a cool tone ashy kind of look
I'll go in with a contour shade and if I
want something a little bit more warm if
I'm doing like a really warm I look or
something I'll go in with a little bit
more of a warm toned bronzer shade I
don't like really warm toned bronzers
you can put your bronzer wherever the
heck you want it just make it I'm adding
a bit of this just to this part of my
nose to kind of give it some more shape
I love the Physicians Formula butter
blushes I like pretty much every shade
of tried there isn't one that I don't
really like but this isn't the shade
vintage Rouge smells so good definitely
doesn't smell like Thanksgiving smells
like summer what if they made seasonal
scented blushes Physicians Formula you
should get on that I want more of a
Goldy champagne highlight for this look
so I'm gonna take the makeup revolution
golden goddess I just showed this in my
ulties for haul video these highlighters
by makeup revolution are so freakin
stunning they're
they have that wet look to them pop it
on the cheekbone what are you guys doing
for Thanksgiving this year I'm actually
staying in Seattle I'm not going home
this year because I just don't really
enjoy Thanksgiving but I'm seeing my
family like a week later I'm gonna go
back once this bronzer palette you can
use whatever bronzer shade you use for
your face I'm just gonna put these into
the crease I'm just kind of I don't even
know I'm doing mixing these two shades
and that shade in that shade so I'll be
having like a friendsgiving this year
which should be fun I have a couple
friends who are here we're gonna attempt
to cook I mean we're not cooking a
turkey that would be catastrophic you
know I might try and whip out some
mashed potatoes bring out my inner
Martha Stewart I actually really enjoy
cooking for people I just don't enjoy
cooking for myself so if there are
people there I will gladly bake some
pies I think we might be doing it at my
apartment not sure yet I'm gonna go into
the Maybelline Gigi Hadid warm just
called warm warm eye shadow palette I
haven't really tried this I used one of
these shades as like a face highlight in
a different video but I haven't tried
the eyeshadows yet just washed a couple
and that that one looks really pretty it
almost looks like a pinky orange look at
that personally when I'm like with my
family for Thanksgiving I don't want to
do anything too crazy makeup wise
because you're just chilling I kind of
want to like focus on the lips and stuff
more so I'm gonna take that on a brush
first might use my fingers it's better
I'm so sure my fingers I almost feel
like you could use this with like a
stippling brush as blush it's a really
pretty shade with just a slight shimmer
actually it looks a little bit more
shimmery in the pan but I want to try
and wet it and see what happens I'm
layering this quite a bit I'm gonna go
back in with that same bronzer palette
and just take the same exact shades that
I used before but now I'm using this
differ brush put this into the crease
this is the Coastal Scents BR 250 it's
like two bucks or something like that so
just on the flat edge brush I'm going to
take this deep brown shade in here
smudges on the lower lash line just to
give a little bit of definition to my
eyes I want a small blending brush this
is a Sedona lace 904 I'm gonna go back
in again trusty bronzer palette and I'm
taking the lightest shade and I'm just
gonna blend that out a little
on the lower lashline it's 4/20 when I'm
filming this right now and it's already
dark outside so weird getting used to it
again I'm just going back in to touch up
that Brown a little bit for the inner
corner of my eyes I'm gonna go back in
with the highlight face highlight and
put this on the inner corner sometimes I
swear brushes just vanish into thin air
so I'm gonna get some of the highlighter
on my brush and then spray it with the
setting spray we could just use water as
you I'm gonna put this right on the
inner corner and hope that we get a nice
pop there we go ooh that's pretty lashes
you could definitely skip if you wanted
to but today I'm gonna pop on the Ardell
faux mink 8th 11 lashes I love these so
I'm just gonna do a coat of mascara put
these on waiting for my lash glue to dry
if you're someone who likes a dewy
setting spray this is one of my
favorites this is the hard candy shear
I'm the hydrating primer mist I just put
the black top on it cuz the white ones
pretty shitty but this is oil free
silicone free alcohol free and this
looks beautiful on top of makeup so I'm
gonna use it today to just give a little
bit more of a glow to my skin it's a bit
sticky but I don't notice it on my face
but if that does bother you you can also
use this underneath your makeup as like
a primer spray which is what it's
technically intended for I should have
done this before mascara
alright so eyelashes are on I just love
these I just love the way these open up
my eyes I also put on some nude liner on
the waterline just by Rimmel now we're
gonna do bottom mascara this is the Wet
n Wild mega length I use this every
single day for bottom lashes it's
awesome it doesn't transfer down to my
concealer so I think we are on to lips
so I have three different options here I
want to show you guys just so you have
options the lightest more
natural-looking one this shade Tura by
Maybelline this is so pretty ever since
I tried this in that first impressions
video evany seen this almost every day
it is so beautiful for just kind of like
an everyday nude so if you don't want
something too intense you can go with
this another one of my favorites that I
think would be good for this look is the
L'Oreal infallible paints in tongue-tied
I've talked about this 50,000 times by
now but formula wise and just the shade
of this this is one of the best liquid
lipstick formulas at the drugstore in my
opinion I think this would be pretty
layered with like a peach kind of gloss
or something over top but I think the
one I want to use for
today's look which is a little bit more
bold is this our Dell whipped I think
that's what these are called yeah Matt
whipped lipstick this is in the shade
upscale flavor these are really
comfortable to wear not the most
long-lasting but it should stay on
unless you're eating like salad with
straight-up oil on it or something
not really sure why this is called
whipped because it doesn't remind me of
a whipped formula at all it just feels
like a moisturizing comfortable liquid
lipstick it does dry down matte but it
doesn't get that dry kind of feeling to
it more I'm looking at this eyeshadow
I'm not that into the lid shade at all I
feel like it's just I don't know it
looks a little bit faded or something
almost so I'm gonna actually go in with
this ey oh this is there in the clouds
shimmer switch I love this shade as a
face highlight but this one you can also
use this bronzer shade as eyeshadow or a
face highlight if you have a deeper skin
tone but what it looks pretty nice as
eyeshadow so I'm gonna go in with that
and just spray it just right on the
center there we go cuz I still want it
to have that orangie look but I feel
like it just needs a little pop right
there CYO eyeshadows that are Intendant
to the eyeshadows not this highlight
palette is so shitty so don't buy that I
did a whole video testing out CYO makeup
all right I'm gonna get festive over
here but this is the final look I just
put on the scarf jacket both these will
be linked down below this is probably
what I'll be wearing on Thanksgiving I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope
you have a good Thanksgiving let me know
how it goes down below or when you guys
are seeing this it won't be Thanksgiving
it so let me know what you're gonna be
doing for Thanksgiving happy Black
Friday shopping if that's your thing
