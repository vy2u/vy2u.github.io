all right so today we're going to be
testing out some interesting products so
I've three main products we're going to
be testing out here a black primer the
new Lancome Rhodes highlight and this
weird-ass elf brush so oh we have a
plant in the background today by the way
some green in our lives it's going to be
first impression videos I'm doing
check-ins throughout the day to see how
everything wears if you're excited for
this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby doe family and subscribe I
upload Monday Wednesdays and Fridays 6
p.m. Pacific time let's do this if you
want to see how these three products
apply and wear throughout the day you're
in the right place just keep watching
all right skin I've already washed and
moisturize my face one of the crazy
products that we are trying out today is
a black primer literally black I have
been slightly stressed with the amount
of filming I have to do in the next
couple weeks hence how we have a new
planet formation on my forehead right
now someone called National Geographic
because what is this the black primers
I'm trying out is they make Beauty
moonlight primer can you remember how I
found this I think one of you guys
tweeted it to me I don't know my son we
just growled by the way we're going to
have to take a postmates break because
copy is on the way so I had never heard
of make Beauty before but their
packaging is on point this is like if I
were to make a cosmetic line oh nice so
it's in a glass bottle and it has a pump
I would expect this kind of quality
packaging because it retails for $55 you
get one fluid ounce of product in here
which is pretty standard for primer my
joy primer Smashbox primers they all
have one fluid ounce of products I just
bought this on their website it has five
star reviews let's see how many people
actually review this okay there's two
reviews a little bit less promising so
I'm going to read some of the claims on
here because this is a very interesting
product so it says for the contemporary
technology-driven life science blends
with nature in a silicone free hydrating
gel cream that moisturizes primes and
modifies skin as a protect skin from the
effects of harmful artificial lights
hello sign me up from tablet smartphones
laptops and iPads as well as urban
pollution I've been seeing this weird
trend in the cosmetic industry lately
with urban pollution products I know
Dermalogica also just came out with some
products for
taking your skin against pollution
postmates is here cause okay food and
caffeine is in my body too like a new
woman so I like the fact that it's
supposed to help modify because I have a
combination oily skin it says that it
shields against HEV light high-energy
visible light and diminishes the impact
of infrared light basically from the
light that comes from electronic devices
which we are all on way too much I know
I am while also offering vitamin D
synthesis contains a marine algae that
protects against pollution and heavy
metals gender-neutral I don't think I've
ever heard a cosmetic product claimed to
be gender-neutral so it's kind of cool
actually says on here the HEV and IR
lights have been shown to penetrate the
skin more deeply than UVA and UVB rays
which are from the Sun this is cruelty
free paraben free fragrance free
hypoallergenic and vegan it doesn't say
anything about why they made this
products black in color but it does say
in the ingredients that there is melanin
in here so for those of you who don't
know melanin is basically what gives our
skin pigment so if you have a deeper
skin tone you have more melanin and if
you're more fair you have less melanin
what I couldn't find is pretty much any
information on melanin being added to
products so thank you to Laura on
Twitter for finding this article you
guys can pause the screen right now and
read all about it if you are curious but
from my understanding adding melanin and
products will not darken your skin tone
it will just protect against UV and h UV
light so okay need to work out more okay
we're good so I am going to be wearing
this makeup throughout the day in order
to test this primer I'm only going to
use it on one half of my face and the
past when I've done kind of primer
comparisons I've done two different
sides but I kind of want to see if it
does anything compared to not using a
primer wow that's so cool I want to
apply the primer to this test with my
face my left half woah okay so it feels
very very lightweight feels like a serum
yeah it feels exactly like a serum and
this is Jilla coned free which is great
if you have acne this actually feels
really nice feels really moisturizing
going on you only need a little bit of
this if you like a little bit kind of
goes a long way ooh I like how this is
setting it feels a bit tacky which I
personally like because I feel like my
foundation is just going to stick to it
a little bit better
and then we actually blend it out
obviously my face is not black I don't
think it looks dark or anything so I
think that's kind of like a tint of
colors I'm curious to see how this wears
throughout the day
poor looks pretty much the same on this
side so if you need to fill in your
pores you'd probably have to use a pore
filling primer it's just a concept of
this I think it's really interesting and
different and it's always cool to see
brands coming out with products like
this the next weird product that we are
going to try out is this elf beautifully
precise precision multi blender massager
that is what it's called it's a brush so
as you can blend in foundation with this
powder or bronzer flawlessly what the
heck so we are going to try to apply oh
hmm feels firmer than I thought which is
kind of promising I want to try and
apply foundation with this thing
to apply foundation apply a little to
the back of the hand and swirl around
with brush using back and forth sweeping
motions apply it all over the face so
that the custom design triangular handle
provides ultimate control law stops
cruelty free white fiber hairs show
exact placement of makeup on the brush
for optimal amount of product use for
precise and even application I actually
don't like white haired brush bristles I
think they look really dirty really
quick so I'm not going to apply my
foundation in the back of my hand I'm
going to use a palette like I normally
do because it just eats up progress when
you put on your hand I was trying to
side was the best foundation try this
out with would be I'm going to use my
pure bare at all which I love but then I
decided that that one I have like a
specific way I apply it with a specific
primer where it wears says Simon tries
brush with my Tarte rainforest of the
sea another favorite foundation I'm
actually going to spot conceal my face
first with some wet mild concealer just
so I have to go and with less of the
reinforce of the sea foundation by the
way I put a light reflector on my table
and it is light changing it reflects the
light back up so basically there's no
more shadow under my next you guys can
actually see the correct neck to face
color did not mean to put concealer on
like half my face over here but it
happened for all around with brush and
then use back and forth sweeping motions
to apply all over the face I'm so
curious about this let me show you guys
a close-up of this brush first because
this is wild so here's a close-up of the
brush what are these these literally
look like ski moguls and here's the
handle it is pretty easy to hold this is
just concealer we're going to swirl this
in the foundation
straighten this out so it looks like
most of my mobiles are covered back and
forth motions and interesting feels
really nice and soft the whole back and
forth thing is throwing me off because I
feel like I'm just rubbing around the
product and it's kind of rubbing it away
on my cheek area I just used up that
whole amount of product on not even half
my face that's definitely more than I
usually have to use but sometimes with
new brushes for me no matter what the
brushes
kind of have to get it like coated first
or else the product just kind of sinks
into the bristles let's try the prime
side and see if it glides on any
different when you do just back and
forth it just you don't get as much
coverage how the heck are we going to do
this on my forehead that is what I want
to know all right I'm going in okay this
I do not like on the forehead this is
just way too big can't really get around
your eyebrows or in your hairline at all
not a fan of this but fix off my
forehead and go in with technically a
second layer I'm going to go in with a
brush I mean look I literally just
squirted out a dime sized amount and
look at how much farther this is going
with a brush and the coverage this is
going to cover my whole face so as far
as prime side versus not prime side it
actually feels like this one is blending
out a little bit easier and I do think
it's helping to hide some of my dry
patches a bit on my forehead all right
so I want to finish off my face apply
the rest of my makeup and then we are
going to move on to the last weird
product which is the Lancome rose powder
highlighter so my eyes are done I'm
going to tell you guys everything I used
in a second but I kind of want to try
out this thing for bronzer too since it
says you can use it to contour so I
wiped off as much of the foundation that
I can and it's totally dried down now so
I'm actually going to use part of this
to try and contour a bit so I'm going on
with my Physicians Formula bronze
booster this middle shade is actually oh
this might be kind of tricky because
this thing doesn't open up all the way
and this brush is pretty big no we got
this which probably is a smaller end
right yeah I'm just going to get a
little bit of product have no idea how
much that is
I actually can feel the stickiness from
the foundation a bit but I think if this
was dry this would actually be nice for
contour if you can focus most of the
product on the smaller part to get in
those cheekbones then you can just kind
of use this to blend upwards not bad
that totally works for contour not bad I
like it for contouring I'm going to try
the wider end of this for bronzer
there's actually not a whole lot of
foundation on this part of the brush so
this might be better and I'm just going
to go with my hourglass bronzer this
stuff is super pigmented so I'm just
like gonna light oh stop kidding that
idea doing that Sigma s 15 brush I've
been really liking this a bronzer lately
if it didn't apply bronzer well I don't
have super high hopes for this blush but
let's try it this is the all made nude
mod blush that works I don't think I
would use this on like a daily basis or
blush I really like this for contour the
best now onto the thing that I'm so
excited about you guys have probably
seen this all over YouTube and Instagram
already but this is the Lancome Lancome
LaRose powder it does this an iridescent
blush highlighter so this is a limited
edition product that retails for 60
bucks it's actually filling on eBay for
around 130 bucks
it has 2.7 stars out of five on
Lancome's website so for $60 you get 1.6
grams or 0.05 6 ounces 0.056
to give you some reference my jcat
highlight which I'm currently obsessed
with this Rose highlight has 0.30 ounces
of product for eight point five grams
1.6 grams 8.5 grams
max mineralized skinfinish has 10 grams
of product so for $60 you get cardboard
packaging this is straight-up cardboard
the actual product this Rose is gorgeous
I would have loved to seen a plastic
base with maybe like a clear top so you
could actually see this rather than a
practical highlighter if you're going to
pay $60 for a limited edition product I
see this more as a collector's item
which I have products like that did I
buy that I never really use I just like
to look at so what have been really cool
they did kind of a clear top so you
could actually fit this on your shelf
and see the Rose the amount of money
that this actually probably
Flynn come to make between cardboard
packaging and such little amount of
product is so low that their profit
margin on this product is freaking huge
the other thing that I think is really
interesting before we actually put this
on my face so this is literally a fake
rose
covered in highlight so I'm just going
to touch one of these petals this is
plastic it feels like a fake rose that
you get at Michael's or Hobby Lobby you
can actually take the entire rose out of
this packaging I'm really have a really
interesting video down below so the
Beauty News Channel they do this series
called the makeup breakup which is where
they basically like destroy products and
weigh them just to kind of take apart
the whole product really interesting
they did a video on this and they
actually showed scraping out the product
taking out the rose rinsing off the rose
and basically underneath it's just a
white rose and it's literally just
covered in highlights the actual amount
of highlight on this rose fits into an
eyeshadow pan if that gives you any kind
of size comparison to what you get with
a normal highlight so here's the
description of this product on Lancome's
website it's as it combines the spring
Parisian pastels with the hot make up
trend on highlighting it the latest on
trend glow look through the most elegant
in vintage mythology the powder is
evenly dispersed among rose petals
inside the Bijou box but let's see how
the actual product is so I'm going to
use my Sigma fo3 brush that I like to
use for highlighting and I'm just gonna
stick it in I don't know how much
product this is going to pick up I'm
just kind of whoa okay so it kind of
flies out
it is pretty powdery it's coming out
there goes $2 so on my skin tone I mean
you can see it I think it looks really
pretty
heard very mixed reviews on this things
I've heard it's chalk II inferred it
looks like baby powder if it's gray I've
heard some people say they love it I've
heard it's more of a subtle highlighter
on me it I mean it's showing up I was
actually expecting it to look a bit more
subtle I don't know if it's just the
amount I use looking very nice not
emphasizing texture or pores a whole lot
it has kind of like a light pink look to
it which I really enjoy I'm going to try
and use maybe a tiny bit less product on
this side and see if it looks a little
bit more subtle yeah so you can still
see it but it definitely looks on
basically more subtle to use less
product this side to me just looks like
a very natural kind of glow which I like
personally I am NOT a fan of the
blinding glittery super intense
highlight trend I do like something with
a pop like this when I want that but on
a day to day basis I prefer something
where I can just get more of a natural
glow where it looks like my skin and
this really does look like my skin I
actually prefer this side using less
product to this side but if you want to
build it up you can get it more intense
I think this might be one of those
products that really depends on your
skin tone because on my skin tone this
does not look ashy at all it has a very
nice pink hue to it because I already
put this much on this side and we're
going to add a bit more to this side to
even it out I think it looks really
pretty kind of shocked now what I pay
$60 for it with the amount of products
you actually get hell no but like I said
it is more of a collector's item Lancome
made this exact highlight just in a
normal size and pan product I would buy
it since we are doing a check-in to see
how the primer wears throughout the day
right now it is
12:07 I'm called a check-in time 12
o'clock because that's pretty much what
I finished up with everything as the
Foundation's been on since about 11:30
so you guys all of my face products so
super quick on my eyes I used the milk
makeup eye pigment these are nails this
is in the shade machine here rager
these actually swatched on my hand way
nicer than they applied to the eye
actually not a fan of this I think it
might be nice to use as a base but it
basically is one of those products that
just kind of smeared around and didn't
have the same kind of pigment as when
you swatch it and you can't layer it or
else it just wipes away I actually just
use this as a base and then oddly enough
I went in with the J cat highlight and I
just press that on top and that's where
I'm really getting the intense shimmer
from and for lips I use Kylie cosmetics
in Malibu and then the crease on my eyes
I used the same Physicians Formula
contour that I used on my face just put
that in the crease on my eyes just so
that everything else
earrings t-shirt watch everything is
always down below I usually try and do
about ten hour check-ins at the end of
the night since it's already twelve
o'clock right now I'm going to shoot for
10 p.m. like normal I'm going to check
in throughout the day so you can see if
there's any kind of difference on the
two sides next check and I do will be a
natural lighting so we'll see you guys
in a few hours all right so it's now
four o'clock I'm in the office
because I was attempting to film a new
intro for the next 15 ooh the foundation
and they totally threw out my memory
card so I'm filming this on my iPhone
right now but it's on the 4k app so it
should be pretty good quality so looking
up close those fuses a different fist
actually it's holding up really well
because I normally pull back my things
right here my foundation kind of rubs
off a little bit and it's actually not
really rubbed off with a lot on that
side I feel like the difference is so
minimal I mean both sides looks pretty
dang similar right now so we're going to
switch out a bunch of product here and
then head back home and start editing
okay so it's now almost exactly 11 p.m.
so everything has been on for 11 hours I
am so tired right now like it's too
bright literally been working all day
just finished so I am very excited to
get into bed right now but let's talk
about how everything is looking I feel
like I look really oily right now and I
don't usually look miss oil with this
this oil this oily with this culmination
so I'm going to look up close and see if
they just pretty rubbed off of my shin
area because I was working like this
so my foundation is like totally rubbed
off around my lip over here but I don't
think that has anything to do with the
primer at all so you feel like this side
of my forehead maybe is a tiny tiny bit
less oily you really can't tell unless
you're like an inch away from my face my
pores look very shiny and oily on both
sides right now so as far as a primary
don't see a noticeable difference
between wearing it and not wearing it at
least with this foundation that I tried
but I do really like the concept of this
I like this black and then the highlight
held up really well totally held up on
both sides of my face
