alright so today we're going to be
testing out a product that has gone
viral on Instagram this is the duracell
face shield patch you guys have probably
all seen the video of the girl like
peeling off her face on Instagram this
is supposed to be kind of like a shield
between your skin and your foundation
and kind of serve as like a second skin
you're supposed to be able to put this
on acne spots to kind of smooth out the
texture we've got a lot to work with and
supposedly help keep your skin clean
since the product actually isn't
touching it or seeping into it on the
actual bottle it also says Darcelle can
help reduce the amount of casual sebum
produced by your skin and refresh tired
skin so I do get oily throughout the day
of combination skin I think I found one
more thing in English one more claim
all-natural centella Asiata class maybe
extract takes care of sensitive skin
trouble by creating a transparent shield
on skin preventing makeup products to
directly touch the skin and protect and
then when you're ready to take your
makeup off you can actually peel it off
which is very exciting so this thing
retails for around $26 on eBay or Amazon
and so it's pretty pricey and you only
get 0.33 fluid ounce as a product it's a
Korean beauty product that's it it's by
the brand farmer maker if you're excited
for this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up did I even say this foundation
Friday I don't think I did foundation
Friday is the new first impression video
every single Friday on my channel
someone having to do with foundation
here we are help my foundation for ID
videos our link down below and a
playlist in the description box along
with everything else on the face I am so
excited so I think I'm going to give
this a little shake no idea what kind of
consistency this has but just in case
it's liquidy doesn't sound liquidy at
all so I have no face makeup on right
now as no product on my skin I just wash
my face so it is clean so as far as I
can tell you're not really supposed to
put this as like an all-over primer I
could almost see that like peeling off
like a face mask if you connected all of
it you know I'm saying I think I'm going
to try this a few different ways just to
fully test it I'm going to use it kind
of as a spot treatment on my acne up
here I just want to see what it does on
the center of my forehead since I have a
lot of texture there and then maybe on
one cheek I'll do like a bigger patch
test let me clip that my bangs here so
I'm going to test it on this acne spot
right here first and I'm starting out
with a very tiny amount
no idea how far this is going to go very
sticky you're supposed to let it dry for
at least a minute what time is there
right now right now it's 9:40 in the
morning exactly if you rub it together
it's literally like peeling and balling
off of my finger come do the center of
my forehead what is this it's not sick
and it's not overly sticky it just has
like a kind of like a creamier gel that
makes sense I don't know if I'm putting
enough on right now don't know said I'm
going to try a bigger patch on my cheek
I don't want to bring it down to my chin
because I feel like that will peel off
right there if you give it any kind of
edge I'm gonna try and use a little bit
more just to make sure I'm actually
getting enough no it's pretty thick yeah
might as well put it over my pores see
how that does I put it like all around
here and it's looking pretty shiny I
think I'm going to put it under my eyes
to see if it fills in my lines at all
and just see how concealer applies over
top and by the way between applications
you kind of have to like get all the
product off of your finger because it
does start to peel which is a little bit
concerning on my cheek it feels a little
tight if you're someone who makes a lot
of facial expressions I'm wondering how
this doesn't peel off I can't really
feel it a whole lot on the center of my
forehead but I definitely feel it down
here it feels like really tight kind of
feels like I was saran wrap on the taste
whoa that dried really fast under my
eyes over my acne I don't feel it but
when it hits the light certain way I can
see the edges Center my face is
definitely fully dry feels smooth it's
not tacky or anything so say it takes
about a minute to a minute and a half to
dry should I put more on maybe I'll try
some on my chin as well right I just
hope them getting a thick enough layer I
don't want it to be super thick because
and I feel like it will just peel off so
I'm putting it over my acne down here if
you rub too much in a certain spot it
will start to ball so kind of just lay
it on and let it do its thing okay so
well my chin is drying I'm going to mix
the covergirl clean my BB cream in 510
with Urban Decay all nighter in 0.5 this
will help to lighten up this one since
it's too dark and add some coverage whoa
okay under my eye feels really tight I
can totally see that one and to apply my
foundation I'm going to use a makeup
sponge because in the video they used a
cushion foundation I just want to kind
of replicate the pushing motion instead
of like
swirling with a brush or anything okay
let's do this now chin is totally dry
well I think I mix that a little bit
light looks okay definitely mix that too
light so I'm going to add some more of
the covergirl whoa dude
you can totally see it kind of peeling
from far away in the mirror I can't see
it but when I get really up close you
can see my skin peeling I'm going to get
really up close and turned on lights
afterwards so you guys can see
everything in detail but let's try this
side so this side I do not have product
on my cheek I do have it under my eye
can't imagine oh okay it's crumbling off
down here what the heck are not like
dragging my sponge either I'm just
pouncing it like I normally would oh it
looks bad on my chin it looks super
keikis thick it's like clinging to the
edges of the product and then it's just
completely peeling off down here I
obviously haven't put on under eye
concealer yet but so far it looks good
underneath my eyes my face is looking
light right now Nora I'm just needs a
darker bronzer and powder okay let's see
how this does on the center of my
forehead I totally forgot that I already
had my brows on I always do my eye
makeup after my face makeup so it's also
peeling off on the center of my forehead
it looks fine on my acne spot right here
I wouldn't say it's making it look any
less texture than any of the other acne
on my forehead if anything actually it
looks a little bit more textured because
the product is slightly clinging around
it my face is like peeling off on the
center of my forehead mmm interesting
whoa my chin looks so gnarly I think I
want to put on my under eye concealer
and set that and then before I put on a
face powder I think I'm going to show
you guys what it looks like a natural
lighting so you can really see what I'm
talking about and then we'll see what it
looks like after I apply face powder if
there's any difference so I'm use my BH
Cosmetics Studio Pro concealer which
I've been obsessed with when I'm lazy I
just use the same sponge to blend it out
it's not all going with my morphe 238 so
far I think this side under my eyes
looks a tiny bit better it looks a
little bit smoother we're going to go in
and set my under eyes with my Physicians
Formula powder like usual with the
powder on it doesn't look significantly
better I still think this I looks a
little bit more smooth under
my ice I'm gonna go grab my other camera
get in front of natural lighting and
show you guys what my face looks like
and then we're going to apply powder all
right so I'm inside the window right now
I'm gonna zoom you guys in holy see
I just noticed this okay we're going to
come back to the other house or just
okay my battery dies literally right as
I start talking you guys this is an
utter disaster take a look at my chin
what the actual heck is happening here
so it has totally bunched up it's
peeling off I mean look at it
this is a joke I don't think it's
sitting badly on this side it just
actually looks more texture to me than
this side of my face this side looks
much smoother in this side it's just
kind of like bunching up more as far as
the under eye concealer I don't know I
mean I think they're looking pretty much
the same there so increasing on both
sides of my eyes they're just dry right
now the center of my face I'm hoping
this will pick up on camera because I'm
headless really up close in the mirror
wrong way
there's definitely appealing on the
center right here so I hope you guys can
see that it's very dry I never really
looked dry right here I do have texture
but it doesn't look dry especially when
I raise my eyebrows check that out
totally peeling right here so on the
acne spot I don't really notice a
difference there is no way in hell I
would walk outside like this let alone
outside of my apartment door guess I'll
still try and powder my face on camera
just so you can see if it affects
everywhere else at all this is obviously
a fatal down here so I'm going to go
back to the other camera alright so
might as well apply powder while we're
here this is the pur cosmetics 4 in 1
pressed mineral makeup very exciting
sparkly case so I'm just going to
lightly apply powder like a normally
would obviously the chin is a lost cause
so and I'm going to go there I'm so
tempted to feel this thing off right now
so with the powder I still think this
side looks better it's just kind of like
anything you add on here as a bit more
texture center of my forehead
everyone say looks any worse with the
powder it just still looks bad
definitely peeling off I can definitely
see where it's starting to lift now oh
we're going to so tempted to top me so I
was planning on doing a full day wear
test with this thing I don't even think
I'm going to do the rest of my makeup
right now because this is obviously a
complete disaster
genocide on the rest
I think I did either little to nothing
or made me look more dry and feely I
think the only area where actually I'm
liking how it looks is underneath my
eyes it does feel very smooth I can feel
the edge though like when I rub my
finger over it I can feel where the
edges coming I'm wondering if it would
peel off the more you talk and move your
eyes throughout the day honestly I don't
really see the point with doing a wear
test with this one because I'm just
going to call it like it is I think this
is a total fail
and ridiculous even on my acne spot
where it's not looking horrible like not
peeling up I don't think it's smoothed
out any at all and I would not recommend
putting this on your face so I'm going
to give this product thumbs-down okay
are we going to peel this off and it
doesn't even guys in for this on my face
it actually feels exactly like this one
peel off face mask I have yeah this I
definitely still feels tighter here we
go we're going to peel this bad boy off
okay can you focus this is a crucial
moment there we go okay this is actually
a little bit more revolting than
satisfying there we go yeah that was not
as fun as I thought there's actually
still foundation right there which is
kind of interesting like it didn't even
totally protect my skin it's just
totally flaky down here I don't think
there's anything I can really grab I'm
gonna try and find an edge over here
there we go
it's disgusting I'm just like kind of
out of words right now this is
falling all over my carpet oh there we
go oh my god this is so bizarre I think
I'm at kind of the edges with where I
can peel it off do the under eye check
that out dude I can't even get this off
it feels like it's like glued on I think
I'm just going to have to wash off this
under-eye because I can't really get
another edge and I don't want to keep
like rubbing and pulling at my eye Wow
have I ever looked better I don't think
so okay I have remnants of this crap
everywhere I think we're going to call
this a wrap I'm going to go wash off my
face because I think I peeled off as
much as I can this product I do not
think is worth $26 I wouldn't even pay a
dollar for this at Dollar Tree anything
I think
there's more texture and more clumping
more caking which is not something you
want under your foundations but if you
