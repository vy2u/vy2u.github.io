camera look wild so I just finished
filming my wish makeup so I'm pretty
sure that video will be up before this I
think it's going up on Monday this will
be a bonus video on Tuesdays that's what
this situation is check out that video
link down below but I figured I'd start
off the vlog here I think I'm gonna be
vlogging the next few days probably put
it into one vlog just in a vlog in mood
and I have some things I want to show
you guys I got a ton of clothes and
just some random things so vlogging it
up if you guys like vlogs don't forget
to give this video a thumbs up while
you're watching I need to desperately
clean my makeup brushes so I think
that's what I'm gonna do right now is
waiting til I was done filming this
video so I could clean all the ones I
use on a daily basis I'm filming again
in the morning so I definitely need to
get these cleaned it's been way too long
anyone know how long's been literally my
desk was entirely clean before I started
filming let's get all these brushes
washed shall we I've got my brush
cleaning station set up here's a bunch
of brushes I have to wash add all these
to the pile all I use to wash my brushes
is this dr. brenner soap you can get it
at usually Marshalls Ross TJ Maxx it's
like 5 or 6 bucks it is amazing at
cleaning brushes if I have one that
really has the makeup like caked in
there what is the person above me doing
they're like literally doing gymnastics
up there I'll use this thing this was by
AOA got it on shot miss a and it was a
dollar so let's get to cleaning shall we
you always want to go down because watch
it like this the water will get up into
the bristles and it can just break down
easier brushes having ly and that whole
thing takes me for this amount of
brushes probably like 25 minutes ish
it's letting them soak in the soap and
doing that a couple times really helps
way faster than just staying there under
the water for forever some of them are
stained like the bristles are stained
but they're clean the white is just
stained that's all I do super quick easy
good evening
so I was actually planning on vlogging
this entire day but had one of those one
of those days bad health day and I
started vlogging this morning at like 7
a.m. it is 7:20 a.m. I am up I love
waking up when it's still dark outside
so pretty
my neck is pretty bad right now and my
head does not feel great so I'm gonna
ice pack it yes and then everything just
went downhill from there but I started
feeling better a couple hours ago so I
actually had plans with Rach to come
over and we're gonna cook dinner that's
what's happening she's coming over here
in a few minutes I've just been trying
to catch up on work I just edited a
video by the way not my hot pack in my
down jacket right now it's like two
degrees in my apartment looking fabulous
right now I had on actually just a
little bit of the cosmetics illumination
powder that I usually like to use for
setting my face but actually just kind
of like even down my redness it's like
all rubbed off the excess at the
chiropractor but but it looked really
nice for just like masking the redness a
little bit and given a glow it's been
really fun to see how products change
for me now like certain products I could
not use in certain ways are working so
much better now and vice versa that'd be
a really fun video actually my mind and
my body are like both not working today
sorry it should be here any minute
actually should probably be here in like
a half hour cuz she's always late but
I'm super excited because we're gonna be
cooking a fresh meal from hellofresh
their today's sponsor of this portion of
the vlog so thank you to them for
collaborating with me on this video by
the way my walking journey is still
going pretty good I'm trying to just
walk be generally healthier eat
healthier so far since I've been back
it's only been about six days 7 days but
so far so good
I know TJ Maxx man right just making
whiskey and a doughnut mug we're classy
I just wanted just to try and zoom in on
guys can only go on like all right so
rich and I decided on the gorgeous
greens faribault super quick as they
give you these instructions and
everything on the back with pictures
whichever you like thanks cooking for
two thousand times easier sounds like
the prep time and everything to the one
we're doing is a twenty minutes prep and
total forty minutes so they're pretty
quick so we're
get to choppin this looks very healthy I
got the veggie bowl by the way there's a
few different bowls you can get I can't
cook me so here we are
we did some mincing having reach chop
some onions over here we've got a spare
guy chocolate
we definitely learned a bunch of
presents
yeah that way it's just have been on
after 16 you know okay it's um we're
gonna do layers I can take a couple of
jokes but I'm not having so excited
smell good and I feel like this is
something I would normally not cook
because I just want no house I think
it's good to get you out of your comfort
zone you know try new things always good
mm-hmm probably a little crispier than
it was intended to be hmm I really like
the lemon Amon arts would I like the
texture mm-hmm Oh with the zucchini on
it's really good get about this again
yeah it's really good we are not Martha
Stewart and it turned out actually
pretty pretty damn good I feel like I
need to try the ones that have the one
pot recipes because like I would
actually feel good bye yeah I don't like
dirty one fight yeah less they are my
life they just like tangles they're just
like doing whatever the heck they want

for being I feel like you are like
leadership and I was sous chef I think
it was like a split we're both sous
chefs there's no master chef in the
kitchen all right so it's the next day I
am actually heating up my leftovers
right now for a late lunch it's like
3:45 today has been crazy I woke up
super early worked out which is totally
consumed in computer work stuff until
like 2 o'clock I was planning on filming
at like 10:00 and just got totally
sucked in so I just filmed I'm pretty
sure this blog will be going up actually
before the video yeah it will be
but I want to tell you guys what it is
but I'm testing out four different kind
of weird products that video and facial
will be coming next week these lot don't
stop what smells so bomb
got me some leftovers so after I eat
this I wanted to show you guys all the
clothes I talked about I think I said
something at the beginning the video I
ordered a ton of super cheap
clothes I want to go through and show
you guys actually camped out and slept
on my hardwood floor last night because
when I was gone and like sleeping on
super hard hostel beds and stuff I woke
up so much better with my neck and back
and stuff so I wanted to try sleeping on
something like firmer so I literally
like camped out on the floor here and I
woke up this morning feeling good very
well could just be because of all the
chiropractic and stuff I did yesterday I
painted my nails
literally three times this morning
because I kept messing them up but I
finally settled on this colors what's on
my nails right now formula X
unmistakable feel like it's a little too
springy still in winter mode over here
but this thing is amazeballs
this is the formula X delete oh it's
like a makeup remover that you just
stick your fingers in this foam thing I
kid you not it takes off your nail
polish in about 5 to 10 seconds
completely you just kind of like move
your fingers around in the foam and it
completely removes everything highly
recommend you don't use any cotton pads
or anything how's it already getting
dark it's not even four o'clock yet got
my coconut Lacroix Lacroix
Lacroix someone said it's Lacroix
Graham's a little enjoy I need to get a
scrapbook I still need to go through all
the letters from you guys that project
Beauty sure so I showed this in and past
vlog but if you guys have any good
scrapbook recommendations or links or
something leave them down below but my
cousin for the holidays got me the five
minute journal which I want to start
using I love this idea take action and
make magic happen
it's kind of cool they give you like
daily prompts and stuff alright let's do
this giant freaking haul so I ordered
all this myself
they froze myself like I said I was
planning on doing kind of like a how
many outfits can I make with X amount of
money video let me know if you guys
would still want to see that that's kind
of where I was going with this so it
actually have some like full 1 outfits
I'm just gonna do this really quick
because there's so much stuff in here
it's a little ridiculous I'm gonna start
off with this jacket so all this stuff
was from romwe which I'm pretty sure is
like merged with chien because some of
the stuff has she and packaging on here
and they're both like the cheap China
Facebook ad kind of sites I'm gonna pull
up this order on my computer so we can
see how much everything is I haven't
gone through all this yeah I just opened
up a few things I took photos with Sarah
Sarah wolf on Instagram I took photos
with her a couple days ago so a few of
the things I wore in those photos you
guys will be seeing those coming on
Instagram so the retail price of all
this was
dollars 49 which you know they go over
and then like price it down I'm pretty
sure so I've spent 357 but I got eight
ton about fits in here and some really
cute stuff so my show you guys so this
jacket was 43 99 I feel like that's not
that good of a deal I thought this one
was a little bit cheaper but this was
one of the winners I'm just gonna put
this over my sweater a few Instagram
photos coming in this jacket and I love
the detailing here and then on the
sleeves its coat you guys can sit on
Instagram too but this was 20 bucks I
got it for and it's really cute it
definitely feels cheap like it feels
pretty thin but it looks really cute on
and I wore it with like this tan hat it
was this I wore this one too in photos
this is just like a baggy kind of
babydoll top I think that's what those
are called those $12.99 they're
definitely a couple pairs of pants I
tried on that don't fit I got these like
ripped jeans these ones don't fit so I
need to return those this doesn't fit
right
but it's really cute this is a skirt
same kind of print as a jacket it's like
a long over the knee thing but it's too
big and like baggy on me so I'm gonna
return that what is this oh this is a
dress oh that's cute ooh that's really
cute cute neckline and then it kind of
flows out who I feel like I'm gonna like
this this is only $8.99 this purse
actually came like broken it doesn't
fully close so that's going back this I
love the color definitely does not look
good on my body this is like an overall
dress kind of thing it has these pockets
down here it just did not look
flattering on my body shape at all
okay these jeans actually look so good
they make your butt look amazing I'll
link these ones down below they're short
enough and tight enough at the bottom
which I always struggle with like the
ankle is always too big and they're too
long because I'm pretty sure these are
really cute I'm really happy about these
the only thing the only thing is that
the zipper and button are backwards
maybe that's a new fashion trend that
I'm not aware of but it just feels kind
of awkward putting them on because it's
literally opposite and these are only
$14.99 keep in those you have a bunch of
random accessory stuff I'm not gonna
show
like tights this is what I'm talking
about to have like Sheehan on some of
this stuff this feels like a bag cause
it's high okay here's the day it's
supposed to like tie around I'm gonna be
returning this one that looks like a
total bag on come in like five thousand
plastic bags I don't know why I ordered
this I don't want or need an orange
purse I think I thought it was a
different color this jacket is so
excited about it's actually so soft
comfy feeling it's kind of hideous but I
also am really into this whole like
fuzzy blanket jacket kind of trend going
on right now where's the other arm like
I can add this to my floor bedding you
know this would be it
oh yeah so comfy and it has a hood loved
the color of this that was 3299 just a
little bit pricey have a feeling this is
gonna look like a bag it has that same
kind of material but I'll try this one
on that looks cute feels pretty cheap
but looks cute I love the color and it
has nice pockets down here I had all
these outfits in my head when I was
ordering these and now I can't remember
but this is cute it's like kind of a
crop top thing and then it ties around
another big high-waisted jeans person
but with like a high-waisted black skirt
or something and leather jacket that
could be cute that was $5.99 more tights
why did you get my federal things
another camel colored jack
oh this was the actual jacket this looks
totally different than online so the
online image looks like it's a camel
color and it looks like a like a blazer
type of material forget like a wool or
something this is definitely like a
cardigan oh I can already tell this
materials gotta bother beats like a that
material that means cringed what is this
oh this is another crop top thing but I
liked it because it's long-sleeve oh
this is cute yeah they had the little
eye ring things on here like the rings
they put on the back of your phone I
think that was like the dollar or
something oh this is a cute little thing
I thought for spring and summer you can
wear this over and you tank tops or
anything if I wanted to it's lightweight
it has a little tie or you can wear this
as a swimsuit cover-up it has this cute
like lace sleeve $6.99 I also got a
really cute rose top that I wore and
- gram photo I don't know if it'll be a
fit actually it's like white with red
roses on it you're wondering where that
was from on Instagram it's from here and
it was $5.99 this I think is what I was
planning on wearing with the black and
white plaid skirt it's like a no hem
turtleneck way like this pretty color
too
I can always wear crop tops to for
videos because you only see like here up
ooh this is cute
another crop top I think I was thinking
it could be paired with one of those
skirts it's cute it's like a high Mac
you guys will be seeing this I'm sure in
a video got a couple of the random
things I'm not gonna show you guys has
already like put them away
looking at my order Oh a half Shea is
great this is cute BRB my battery is
about to die so super quick this is the
skirt it looks super cute on fits
perfectly I think I got a size medium in
this one and it fits great feels like
really nice like thick suede laces down
really cute and then last thing actually
got a double a second one of this
swimsuit I get so many questions about
this whenever I post on Instagram or
something wearing it
it's from romwe I think it's like 15
bucks or something like that maybe even
less than that and it's super flattering
the way it's cut has this line right
here it just makes you look good in all
the right places and I ordered a second
one in cases one like dies on me that's
how obsessed I am with it like I got
some good stuff I'm gonna attempt to
return those few things I just got to go
in knowing like it's not the best
quality but they do have some cute stuff
on there you really look through it and
sometimes you can find some winners now
I need to put all of this away I'm gonna
try and figure out this background
situation because here's the deal with
the new lens I tried like moving that
shelf over whatever long story short I
have to sit in a weird way so that it
covers the door handle or else that's
annoying cuz that shows in the
background and I obviously can't like
move the door over so basically I need
to be sitting in the middle right there
so what I'm going to try and do right
now I think is actually move this onto
the door I'm thinking of just taking out
the greenery stuff and like taping it
onto the back of the door because you'll
only see part of the green hanging down
anyways look at my most recent videos
and you'll see what I'm talking about
but this is like behind my head and you
can't really see it and then there's a
big white space over here so I
definitely need something in this corner
that I can like
hang on the door this is heavy-duty
enough but we'll find out they're trying
to see in this viewfinder if you ever
need to hang leaves duct tape does work
okay that's a little better
well yeah now we don't have an empty
white space okay it is Saturday I'm in a
rush right now I'm running late but we
are about to go on a hot tub boat I'm so
stoked I woke up way late to ruin a
swimsuit don't even know what I'm
wearing right now put on a little
foundation we're gonna all make
breakfast together so I'm headed over to
my friends house and then we're gonna go
in this hot tub boat and I brought my
waterproof camera like the GoPro kind of
thing so hopefully I can get some cool
footage but a boat with the hot tub on
it if that wasn't a self explainatory
so today probably take up my skirt
before I wash my face today didn't quite
go as planned we did breakfast got all
ready and we were literally about to
head out to the hot tub boat thing and I
checked my email and they had to cancel
because the winds in Seattle today were
too insane it was super windy so
probably not the most ideal time to be
out on the lake in a hot tub so we have
to reschedule it but let me know down
below if you guys want me to vlog it
when we go back I always forget when I
bobby pins on my head we have to find a
time that works for everyone again so
I'll probably be a couple weeks but then
we were in the hot tub mood so we ended
up finding a community pool instead and
going to that tub there was actually
really fun even though we were sitting
in like a two-foot kiddie pool then we
went got some lunch I just hung out as a
couple different friends for like happy
hour slash dinner thing and now it came
back and I just finished editing this
video that you guys are seeing right now
now I'm getting ready for bed I actually
did major closet cleaning
I'm taking my fresh Seabury oil I have a
cold dry skin skin care routine so link
that down below but it basically goes
through all this
oh whoops forgot I was wearing eye
makeup usually went with the eyelash
extensions even they're like totally off
I should actually just put the oil on
them now to get them to fall off because
there's only like
hanging on there mmm Oh cleaning my
closet I guess I have a bag of stuff
that I'm gonna donate I got rid of a lot
of his stuff because any time I shop
like get a bunch of new clothes I try
and go through and get rid of stuff yeah
I'm just gonna use the oil on my eyes
today it's like four loads of laundry
still laundry that they're done for my
truck cleaned up my filming room and
everything but while I was doing all
that I found this documentary on Netflix
Club banking on Bitcoin if you're
remotely interested in Bitcoin or if you
know nothing about it and you just want
to learn more about it super interesting
documentary banking on Bitcoin let me
know what you think of it now I go in
with my serve a hydrating cleanser my
baby love of my life obsessed with this
face wash and then just for my first
thing I going with the salt water spray
and I take my Mario Badescu aloe toner a
little bit that
I have to rub it down my neck just to
make sure to get any of the concealer
and stuff off so now I go in with
moisturizer using a survey night
renewing cream I used a decent amount I
liked really cook this on I also bring
this all the way down my neck before I
go in with my oil I let that sit in for
a few minutes I try and do like 10 but
realistically it's probably like do do
what you can do so while they wait for
that I usually change them to PJs or
brush my teeth or something don't forget
to floss dad I know you're watching all
right now that's been a few minutes I'm
going to take my ordinary Rosa Boyle I
use I feel like quite a bit of this
probably four drops try to just press
this into my skin rather than rubbing
because I read through that's how oil
absorbs the best and I can mention the
skincare video you want to put oil on
top of your moisturizer not the other
way around and then I've also been
putting a little bit of this down my
neck just for some moisture and maybe
help with some anti-aging or something
my Holy Grail aqua for advanced therapy
the healing ointment this is the best
lip product ever for super dry lips boom
so here's my skin post skincare products
so I'm gonna wrap up this vlog here
because I'm just gonna tidy up the desk
in the Beauty room I did everything else
except the dust so I'm gonna do that
