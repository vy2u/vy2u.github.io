get yourself a remote I feel like one of
those women who wears sunglasses in the
airport can't quite tell if they're
famous or just hungover
all right whoa we're about to throw back
today
old-school YouTube style who's been
watching YouTube beauty kind of related
videos for this long that you remember
when what's in my bag videos were like
the thing the cool thing to do now I
feel like they're kind of the opposite
of that but here we are when you guys
are seeing this I'm actually out of the
country so I asked you guys on snapchat
what you wanted to see since I'm pre
recording right now and a few of you
guys actually said you want to see
what's in my bag video so that's why
we're doing this I really still enjoy
watching his videos I find them super
interesting it's kind of like when
you're in line at the grocery store and
you're like checking out what the other
person is buying if you're excited for
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up but if you're new here you can
join the bay radio family and subscribe
I upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time alright so the only
criteria I have when I look for a bag is
that it has to be black if it's not
black I won't actually wear it on a
daily basis and I can't have those
straps that you know the ones that just
like jab into your armpit I just needed
to be comfy and black and I'm good I'm
not really into designer stuff if I like
something that's designer I'll get it
but because I like it like I like the
look of it not just for the brand name I
just find myself getting more
satisfaction from finding like a really
good $10 purse than I do in designer 1
but the purse that I carry on a daily
basis and have for the last at least
probably two years actually I think it's
been a couple years is this bag right
here it's kind of just like a slouchy
bag that has these two long shoulder
straps so it just sits really nicely on
my body something that I find really
hard when shopping for bags and this is
also probably why I'm not that into bags
is because of how short I am and
everything a lot of bags just look a
giant on my frame so it's kind of hard
for me to find a bag that's gonna hold
enough stuff and that can fit my laptop
but that isn't gonna just take over my
whole body so this bag I actually got
from papaya I don't know if you guys
have papaya by you we used to have one
in Seattle and they went out of business
but I got it there before they went out
of business and this bag I think was
like 15 bucks 20 bucks and I carry some
weight in here like I carry this when
I'm traveling and I'll put my laptop in
it and I am shocked that this is still
in one piece I'm just kind of like
waiting one day for this to just break
on me and have all my go everywhere
so this is the bag that we're going to
be going through
today but then I have kind of my nicer
bag for if I'm gonna be like going to
something fancier or an event or
something I'll usually bring this bag
this is by Henri Bendel and I love the
look of this bag oh this thing it's be
clean probably whoops prepared for this
video by the way I didn't clean out any
of my stuff so I have no idea what we're
gonna find in here this bag I love it
has this white bubble material they make
a bigger version of this and then this
is the I think it's called the mini
jetsetter this is super cool because you
have these short handles here and then
you have a long strap I actually change
the strap I think I got this one on eBay
or Amazon I'll link everything I can
down below but the cool thing about this
is that you can actually convert it into
a backpack so if you're traveling or
something it's just awesome I love the
gold hardware they have tons of
different colors and everything of this
bag but I'm really happy that I picked
up because I feel like I've gotten my
use out of it and I just love the way
that this looks let's dig in shall we
so this has a magnetic closure alright
so first thing I'm just reaching in I
have a rx bar these taste so bad but
apparently they're healthy for you
I get really low blood sugar so I always
keep a bar some kind of food in my purse
because if I'm out and I need to eat
something three egg whites 14 peanuts 2
dates and no BS I ordered like the
variety pack of these after I saw an
Instagram sponsored post they sounded
good they just don't taste like good but
they have 12 grams of protein I also
wanted to film this now because in my
time I'm packing so I really need to
clean this out anyways cuz I haven't
done this for a while I have bliss tried
in blue body lotion I think I got this
out of hotel in Portland mmm it smells
really good comment down below and let
me know if you're someone who takes the
hotel samples or do you leave them
smithing coal lip gloss so I don't bring
makeup to touch up throughout the day
with me like any kind of face products
or brushes or anything I usually only
have lip products in my bag this color
is really pretty it's called now kiss
now kiss smithing colt's packaging is so
beautiful they make nail polishes and
some makeup products now this is a
really pretty mom nude kind of color
that's supposed to be in a bag but so
next up is my wallet Kate Spade salsa
needs to be cleaned I actually got this
at the outlets in San Diego they haven't
Speight outlet and when I was there it
was like 50% off everything and then an
additional like 10% off or something so
I got this for a really good deal I love
anything black and gold this just has
your classic card slots and then there's
like a couple other slots honestly it's
not the easiest wallet to get stuff out
of oh this is definitely expired your ad
coupon have some Macy's money I have a
Top Pot doughnut frequent flyer card
they always go there for coffee they
have really good eisah lattes there if
you're in Seattle never usually keep
cash but I actually have cash on me
right now for some reason I don't block
all this up I have my I pledge card this
is what you get when you're on accutane
you have to show the pharmacist this
when you pick up your prescription each
month forever 21 store credit because
they have the worst online return policy
ever
I literally have one too okay there's
like three more in here that are all
stuck have a little bag in here says
make up babes tacos they're forever
I have no idea where I got this in here
I have
Cetaphil moisturizing cream because I am
a friggin desert right now this is what
I use on my hands mostly because of the
heck Zimmy and dryness and everything
and also have a lip balm in here this is
the Jack Black SPF 25 shea butter and
vitamin E I don't use this a whole lot
because I usually just coat my lips in
aquaphor before I go out the lip
products I try to keep in here but
pretty sure they're all at the bottom of
my purse this is great it's like
cleaning and filming a video all at the
same time I see some trash Raisa tripped
in the straw and a thin ponytail this is
definitely not mine because these do not
work in my hair I have a USB no idea
what's on this these are really cool so
I like to keep I phone camera accessory
things in my purse because you never
know when you're gonna need to take an
Instagram photo you know I'm saying
these are cool they're like clip-on
lenses this one is fisheye this one is
just super wide angle so those are cool
it just kind of gives your photos a
different look and they're fun for
traveling and stuff a ballpoint pen
another ballpoint pen this is a business
card from the piercing place Laughing
Buddha in Seattle and Capitol Hill it's
awesome if you need to get piercing
place and they do I'm just like throwing
this stuff everywhere we have bobby pin
never actually find those when you need
them and watch I'll probably find like
30 have some gum this was actually from
my China trip and this is so good this
gum is
hence like I always warn people before I
give them peace of this I'm not kidding
it is intense but this is amazing if I
ever go back to China I'm getting some
more I keep my vlog camera in a fuzzy
sock because honestly fuzzy socks are so
much better than actual cases because
they don't take up a lot of room but
then your camera doesn't get scratched
so the vlog camera uses the canon g7x
it's awesome I've tried different Sony
cameras I much prefer the canon g7x this
is also the camera that I use for
foundation check-ins when I'm a natural
light and everything so I'll link this
down below but this is a great vlog
camera but we'll slide him back in there
and then I just kind of like wrap the
sock around here there you go case pair
of sunglasses in here this is a Warby
Parker case because it was the only big
enough one to fit these sunglasses
because these are these are intense but
these were from Amazon they're kind of
like saline dupes feel very la in these
but they're really comfy and I just love
the look of these okay we have a bunch
of trash I see bag tag KJ max receipt
another t.j.maxx paper in here receipt
from northern quest casino this boat can
trip business Oh
improv ticket I love improv I've gotten
really into it the past couple months I
could never do improv like that is my
worst nightmare I hate being in front of
people I hate anything to do with acting
but I really enjoy watching it I'm that
person who gets nervous just sitting in
the crowd hey say calling me but it's
really fun highly recommend jet stadium
brough Macy's return receipt oh I
ordered three winter down jackets was
planning on keeping one of them and
actually returned all three none of them
fit right we have a lipstick MAC
lipstick this is in the shade Boston
friend weight would but some boss of
buzzin or boss it's like this light navy
color a mac lipglass in here this is in
the shade under the sheets oh this one's
really pretty like a light pink pearly
shade a York Peppermint wrapper we have
my favorite Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer and this I just like
keeping in case I need to cover
something up or if my foundation like
rubs off after a chiropractor
appointment or something I can just you
know another pen cuz apparently you need
ten thousand pens in your purse this is
really cool this is a I phone remote
it's a remote to take photos of yourself
so a lot of my Instagram photos if I'm
not with someone I'll just put my phone
on I have like a bendy tribe
I don't think it's a no it's not in here
right now but I have a bendy tripod I
use that you can like wrap around a pole
or like a rail or something and then you
just connect it to bluetooth and then
you can take the photo if you don't have
an Instagram husband
get yourself a remote and I'm pretty
sure this is like under 10 bucks just
make sure you turn it off because I've
ran out of so many batteries they
accidentally keep it on all of those
kind of things started in here I don't
know how they ended up everywhere except
there okay an airport oh this is the
Starbucks at the airport you see the
four receipt
this was the tart clay foundation this
was from a while ago okay have ton of
coins down here another bobby pin these
are not even US coins this is from China
another bobby Jen PowerBar wrapper this
is also I could never have a really nice
purse like how do people keep them so
clean okay so this is kind of wild
actually kept this in my purse since I
got this which was when I was 16 and
living in Israel it's just a little
keychain but the keychain thing broke
off it just says like Hebrew on one side
you know those things that you feel like
are just good luck so you keep them feel
like no matter what purse I have I'm
always gonna have to keep this in there
what is this oh this is a super glue lid
I don't know where the super glue is I
usually do have super glue in my purse
though because it's super handy another
bobby pin and this is my pharmacy this
is where I keep all my pills this
another Kate Spade coin first thing
that's technically supposed to be like a
card coin purse fold the pills advil
naproxen ibuprofen mister goodies
sumatriptan memory card I keep this one
in here for the blog camera in case I'm
out and I run out of storage or
something some more bobby pins I feel
two more right so besides some cleaning
that needs to happen I think that's
everything right that is everything this
is what the person's like when it's
empty I like that it has this flat
bottom but it still is slouchy enough
that it doesn't go like out too far from
my body and again it just sits really
nice and I feel like the leather from
the outside like you can't really tell
it's a super maybe on this friggin
high-def camera and studio lighting you
can tell but in real life it looks like
nice leather and it's lasted in a while
so I wish they still made this back if I
can find it online I'll link it down
below let me know if you guys have found
a bag like this anywhere cuz
I need to be prepared for when this baby
breaks but that is everything I really
don't know how people keep their bags
clean my apartment by the way is nothing
like my bag I keep my apartment really
organized and clean my bag I think is
just where like everything goes I hope
