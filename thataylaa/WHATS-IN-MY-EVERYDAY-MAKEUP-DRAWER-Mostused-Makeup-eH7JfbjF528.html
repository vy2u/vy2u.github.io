booster wow this is a little excessive
alright so I've been packing my life
away packing up this whole filming room
makeup collection everything for the
move and as I was packing everything up
I left out a couple bins of makeup which
are my everyday makeup and then products
and I'm still trying and still want to
play with I figured it might be fun to
show you guys what my everyday makeup
bin consists of so here it is a little
excessive we got a lot in here to go
through but these are basically the
products that when I'm not filming and I
just want to quickly throw on a face of
makeup I'll just grab this bin put it on
my desk and just reach from here and go
and with these products so some of the
products like eyeshadows and
highlighters and stuff obviously I
switch out just depending on what I'm
feeling at the moment but if you're
excited for this video don't forget to
give it a thumbs up okay where are you
going voice if you're new here you can
join the burrito family and subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time let's get into what is
in this bin alright so foundation
primers and setting sprays I never put
in this bin because they just would not
fit I just have them on my desk right
here in foundation I literally switch up
every single day setting spray slash
primer is always this one or my Revlon
pore reducing primer which book just sit
on my desk I'm not gonna go in any order
here I'm just gonna pull out products
and attempt not to make this video an
hour-long all the makeup on my face
right now by the way is from these
products I'm just gonna start grabbing
so my bottom lash mascara is always wet
and wild making links I love this
mascara for the mom lashes has a really
tiny comb I've used this every day for
literally I don't even know now 6 years
probably I've gone through so many of
these it's drugstore it's a couple bucks
if you have issues with your mascara
transferring down to your concealer try
this one you can get the waterproof
version too this one is the waterproof
version the only all-over face powder
I've been keeping in here is the Sephora
micro smooth powder and the shade light
I did a whole video on my favorite face
setting powders but this one is just my
go-to on a daily basis just to set my
cheek area so I can blend bronzer and
stuff on top and I just don't find that
I really need any other powder for this
this one does the job we have a
Physicians Formula butter bronzer this
one's in the shade bronzer I have a
whole other two bits of my most used
products that are like blushes brought
there's highlighters but those are all
packed up so these are the things that I
like purposely kept out I like this
shades so much better than the actual
lightest shade that one looks super
orange on me but this
really pretty and you can always tone
down a bronzer too if you have fair skin
using a face powder so just lightly dust
over it and it just gives it kind of
more of an ashy tone and tones down any
of those orangie tones so if you do have
any bronzer that you feel like it's too
orange you just you can try that out
blush in here I have CH a summer love
you guys are gonna have seen most of
these products 50,000 times at this
point but this is my everyday makeup in
this is one of my favorite blushes of
all time if you like a glowy pink blush
look no further my eyelash glue which I
don't know why I feel like I've never
talked about this but this has been my
go-to eyelash glue probably for the past
few months and this is the kiss strip
lash adhesive in clear with a low and
this one I find irritates my eyes the
least my eyes are super sensitive lashes
lash glue and it has been a struggle to
find a lash glue that I can actually
keep my lashes on for more than a couple
hours and this one I wouldn't say is
like comfortable on my eyes I still get
some burning and stuff but it's
definitely the best out of the lash
glues I've tried and it's latex fur you
can get it from the drugstore you just
have to let it dry down a lot before you
stick on your lashes so wait a solid
like literally 45 seconds to a minute
before you actually stick your lashes on
or else they're gonna slide around
obviously a physician's format eye
booster I think I have like three of
these in here yeah here's another one
this has been my go-to liquid eyeliner
now for years I have the shades ultra
black if you're gonna try this out don't
get black get ultra black I love it it
makes the easiest wing possible if
you're a winged beginner if you have
struggles with your wings this just
gives you a really smooth line it's hard
to mess up the only thing is it's not
super super waterproof so if you do have
like a teary outer corner this one will
kind of rub off but what you can do is
just shape it with this and then put
something like the Kat Von D liner which
is right here as well go in if you put
the Kat Von D liner or something that's
a little bit more waterproof just right
where you're tearing up then it'll help
it kind of smear I haven't had to do
that in a while but when I was on
accutane there was a phase at the end
where my eyes were getting super super
watery so I did have to do that just to
make it a little bit more waterproof
this is the Sigma eyeshadow based primer
some of the stuff in here I don't reach
for a whole lot and I'm kind of like
decluttering as I go through but I'll
tell you which ones but this is one of
those products that is in here because I
think I wanted to try it out it's
basically like a cream base in pencil
form I like this but I still reach for
my Mac Paint Pot more so I should
probably just
de-clutter this one and put that in a
different bin here's my back Paint Pot
this isn't a shade of soft ochre Wow
what's going on with my voice today I'm
like halfway done with this one I've
used this thing for years soft ochre and
paint really are my go-to shades soft
ochre is lighter and a little bit more
yellow
I wish Mac came out with a base that was
neutral in tone and a little bit lighter
I don't know why they haven't ever come
out with like a white Paint Pot I feel
like that would be kind of a basic thing
but these are the best it's worth the
money alas you forever I keep
repurchasing those even though it takes
me like years to go through one
literally this is the elf eyebrow kit in
the shade light I've been using this
shade for contour a lot recently I've
been using this almost every day I love
this as a contour shade it's really nice
if you have fair skin made sure you're
pressed powder and then two of my
physician formulas powders which both
have hit pan on this one is almost a
goner lately I haven't been using this
shade this is the correcting powder I've
just been using the shade translucent
light mixed in with the major pressed
powder and this has been the best eye
combo for me lately I don't get major
creasing it just looks very smooth under
there and this one is awesome for
brightening the under eyes next up
mascaras so I have two of the Too Faced
better than sex in here don't know why I
don't know why these are both open but I
just oh this one says my name on it
that's exciting and don't think I ever
noticed that until right now
yes I've been my go-to mascaras for
years I love Too Faced better than sex
on its own but I also love layering it
with this I'll go in with this first and
then go in with this one this is the
Catrice glam and doll I don't like the
waterproof version these are waterproof
it rains in Seattle this combo I've
never had my mascara run if I'm you know
having a good cry sesh or watching a
good movie or something I've never had
my mascara run when I wear these so they
are waterproof even though they're
technically not the Too Faced buy them
sex waterproof version sucks do not get
that one it's totally different this is
when those mascaras that is either super
hit or miss for people which I feel like
as most mascaras I don't find this to be
comparable whatsoever to the L'Oreal
lash paradise I think they're completely
different formulas and everything so
this one for me is worth the money
XO Beauty Lucent radiant glow highlight
powder in here I love loosen and I also
love Aurora yeah that's what it's called
I'm actually wearing this one right now
on my cheeks and I also like to use this
as
I'm like a powder on my forehead just to
highlight so I just put it on the high
points right here this is one of those
beautiful powders that you can build up
to have an intense highlight or you can
just use it to be more of a natural glow
XL Beauty highlight powders are gorgeous
if you're someone who likes a very
subtle glow which is what I usually
reach for on an everyday basis which is
why it's in here we have Laura Mercier
flawless fusion concealer love this
concealer for preventing creasing if you
mix this in with another concealer just
to add that coverage or if you just like
more medium coverage concealers this was
great
I did a whole video on a concealer
roundup where I was kind of reviewing
eight different concealers so if you
want to know my full thoughts on this
concealer you can check out that video
but my go-to concealers lately have been
flower beauty light illusion full
coverage concealer mixed in with the
k'kaw concealer in the shade 1 this
combo for me has been I think the best
concealer combo I have found yet
this one dries down super quick super
matte so I love these two together
because this one almost sets this one
and there's something magical about the
combo of these two is my perfect shade
wearing them right now I've been wearing
them in almost every video brow product
Maybelline tattoo studio in deep brown
dark brown deep Brown again I've talked
about this so many times but it's all my
brows right now we're at every single
day lasts amazing this is one of those
ones that I'm going to declutter I'm not
gonna put this back in here but this is
the Lancome the base nude 0 3 I got this
off a glam bot I thought it might be a
good alternative to like the Mac Paint
Pot and it's fine I just feel like it's
a little bit too creamy maybe I just
need to let it like dry out a little bit
thing I like about the Mac Paint Pot is
that it never creases because it's not
creamy it like sets down almost we have
a frente Beauty highlight this is in
kilowatt girl-next-door and Chic freak I
love this shade right here I've been
really into it even though it looks like
it would be too kind of dark pink salmon
in the pan when it's actually on your
face it is a lot lighter and it just
gives this really pretty kind of like
champagne salmon reflect to it this I
didn't know was in here and this is on
the very bottom haven't used this in a
long time this is the benefit gimme brow
in the shade medium deep this one is
great for adding like fiber kind of
hairs to your brows it really does
somehow fill them in this is my go-to
brow product for a while I feel like I
just found other ones I like a bit
better now
have a ridiculous amount of eyeliners in
here because this is my problem
I don't up and then instead of
sharpening it I just reach for a new
eyeliner even though it's not like my
favorite eyeliner I just use it because
it's sharp so that's kind of the
situation with the essence gel eye
pencil this one is kind of growing on me
it's what I've been using on my
waterline lately because it's the only
sharp one but my all-time favorite
waterline eyeliner is the LA girl glide
gel liner this one is bomb it's a couple
bucks works amazing super black stays on
Kat Von D tattoo liner and then a wet
and wild proline felt tip eyeliner I
actually really like this one I don't
know why I don't reach for this more the
wet and wild one we have a focal or gel
eyebrow gel pomade there's word in ash
Brown this was from the wish app video
haven't been reaching for pomades lately
I've just been using the Maybelline one
but I was using this for a while before
I discovered this one I think this I
haven't used for so long I don't know
Isis in here this is the Urban Decay
Naked skin
weightless concealer this used to be my
favorite concealer at one point and I
still really like it but for some reason
now it creases more on me than it used
to it's almost like a little bit too
creamy I should try mixing this with a
k'kaw that might be a good combo I'm
actually gonna do that I'm gonna keep
this in here we have the Jakob pearl
Luminizer one of my favorite
highlighters of all time I've talked
about this a ton too but I like mixing
this in with loose face powders to give
my face an overall glow just a tiny bit
or as a face highlight it just super
effortlessly kind of melts into your
skin and is so frickin pretty if you
like a pinkish white highlight this is
super affordable you can get on Ulta and
it's bomb.com a lot of the blushes I
just go back into that bin for but this
is a jus a duo this is the adore I'm
wearing this one on my face right now
but the formula of these blush duos are
so beautiful they're one of the most
easy to work with blendable blush
formulas I've ever found I just like it
cuz it can literally go with any look so
no matter what I'm doing that day this
one is just easy to work with and I can
use it so to get the kind of brow
strokes right in the front that I
usually do I always go in with the Make
Up For Ever brow liner in 40 you have a
cheaper option that works and you do a
similar thing let me know what it is
down below it's mostly the color for me
that's hard to find
but I just love drawing on the front
because I feel like it just gives you
that illusion
having like really fluffy brows in the
front another eyeliner pencil Catrice
gel liner it cosmetics superhero liner
this actually reminds me almost exactly
of the Physicians Formula
eye booster I would say this is a pretty
close dupe the formula the brush
applicator how smooth that goes on this
is super similar so if you like that it
cosmetics one try this one in ultra
black you might be able to save a few
bucks mu a lip gloss and baby pink this
is one of my most reach for glasses on
an everyday basis it gives you that
super pretty nude pink kind of look I
dropped in a few drops of peppermint
essential oil in here to give it a
better scent because it did smell super
chemically and now it just smells
amazing like peppermint this I feel like
if I only could choose like three
bronzers to use for the rest of my life
this would definitely be one of the
three this is the Kevin and Quan
celestial tropical nights bronzing veil
the thing I love about this is that it
has this gradient here so if you want a
contour this one is beautiful as a
contour if your around my skintone but
you can also go in with this middle
shade as more of a bronzer or just mix
all three it does have a subtle kind of
glow to it you don't notice it as much
when it's on your face or I don't I
don't think it looks like super shimmery
on the face but it's definitely not a
matte bronzer couple more water line
eyeliners this one's by L'Oreal it's
just in white and this one I just
started using mostly because I just
needed a good I've been on the hunt I
need a good white and nude water line
eyeliner because this one I'm also like
on the fence about it's a color pop
honey dude it does the job but again
these two I'm just like trying out but
not sure you have another Physicians for
my booster wow this is a little
excessive
so eyeshadow palettes I kind of keep
some of them in here but also I have
this whole other bin of products that
I'm still trying out and that's mostly
where I keep the eyeshadow palettes but
I do have a few in here that are ones
that just recently I've been trying out
so I put in here but this is the lorac
pro 2 this is the second one yeah lorac
pro 2 palette I have such mixed feelings
on this so far because I love the shades
in here it's more of like a cool tone
palette and typically I love the formula
of BlueRock eyeshadows because they're
pigmented they're soft they're super
easy to work with but there's something
about these dark shades that I get the
most intense not even initial fallout
it's like they're out
the day it just like falls onto my face
so I've tried it a few different times
on I think in a couple of foundation
Friday or 15 days of foundation videos I
wore this palette and that happened so I
don't know if I just need to try it with
a different primer or what but I love
the tones in here so I'm like trying so
hard to make this work and then this one
is what's on my eyes today so you say
Anastacio softly on palette again I've
been trying this out and so far I really
like if you were like scarred by the
whole subculture situation like I was
this is totally different this is like
back to the good old Anastacio Modern
Renaissance kind of formula so I went in
with that brown shade fairy and then
just some of the matte shades in here
they do have repeats in here this I'm
wearing on my lips right now it's the
L'Oreal color riche again I have a bin
that I usually go for that are like my
most used nude lip products and that's
packed up so these are the ones that
were just kind of left over that are in
here that I still want to use this is a
L'Oreal pencil in the shade 112
mastermind
Matt Matt Sturm and this is a beautiful
nude but a little bit peachy but also
super wearable where you can like tone
it down with a lighter nude that's a
great lip liner I'm also wearing it with
wet and wild cat suit nudie patootie
also on my go to nudes and then on top
of that we have a three lip combo day
today this is one of my favorite glosses
the form of these is by L'Oreal is
unreal why is there no oh here we go
nude ballet 6:01 this is one of the most
comfortable buttery lip glosses if you
haven't tried these by L'Oreal these are
bomb I want to try more shades I have a
couple other ones but this is like my
go-to one it's like a peachy kind of
nude shade put it on it doesn't feel
super sticky and uncomfortable you can
layer it on pretty much any nude lip and
it works this is a newer eyeshadow
palette that I've been trying this is
the Jay essential Jet Set palette and
the shades in here are just again easy
for me to create kind of an everyday
look with because I do like these kind
of tones for everyday a little bit more
cool tone if I want to deepen it up I
can go in with this shade right here and
then this shade is just like a nice
neutral lid shades pad I have a lot of
brow products in here that I haven't
used in forever so this is the Cobra by
benefit in the shade 5 Foundation inches
are the worst benefit precisely my brow
pencil in the shade 4 has been my go-to
brow pencil for so long this one I love
the formula of it has a little bit of
grip to it oh this is almost actually
out the
micro brow pencil this is in this shade
this is called ultra precise brow pencil
just kidding this is in the shade
neutral brown I don't love the shade of
this but the formula is great so if you
can find a shade that matches you in
this pencil for a few bucks this is balm
super comparable to this one it's almost
like a little bit finer of a tip so if
you like a really thin kind of pencil
you'll like this one we're coming down
to the last two things here so the BH
Cosmetics Studio Pro total coverage
concealer this is one of my favorite
concealers I haven't reached for this in
a really long time concealers are one of
those things for me that I feel like my
under eyes start to get used to a combo
and then it looks totally crappy so I
have to like switch it up and then come
back to it so I feel like this will be
in the rotation sometime soon hopefully
not because I love the combo I have
right now but if it starts looking a
little creepy and weird
I might switch back to this but this is
a few bucks on BH Cosmetics website and
the last thing I have in here is another
eye liner Wow how many eyeliners do I
have in here like 5000 this is the old
abudiate type liner i think i tried this
in the full face of uLTA makeup pretty
sure I want to like this so bad because
this has literally the smallest let me
show you close this has the smallest
freaking tip let me give you some
comparison actually so here it is
annexed to the Physicians Formula one
which already has a pretty fine tip but
look at how freakin tiny this thing is I
think just because it has that felt tip
I do get a lot of drag with this one
which is unfortunate I wish someone came
out with a brush tip this small but that
just glided a little bit easier because
I do get that like staggered kind of not
a smooth line when I try and use this
that's everything in my everyday makeup
drawer but I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did you can give it a thumbs up
I appreciate it it helps me out and let
me know what your kind of go to everyday
products are down below I love you guys
thanks for watching see you my next
