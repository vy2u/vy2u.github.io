excessive who's surprised
all right so I just got back from
Sasquatch Music Festival
last night I'm about a thousand percent
dead right now don't ask me why I'm
drinking tea instead of coffee
definitely not helping the situation so
as I started to unpack my suitcase last
night I figured I would do it what's in
my travel makeup bag since I don't think
I've ever done that maybe like five
years ago
I like watching these videos because not
only is it interesting to me to see what
other people pack it's kind of like when
you look at the person behind you in
line at the grocery store to see what
they're buying but also a lot of these
products are kind of my everyday go-to
makeup or at least the things I've been
reaching for recently I've been gone the
entire month of May I think I've been in
Seattle for about three nights maybe
four nights I was out of the country for
a couple weeks I have a vlog on my China
trip I'm also gonna be having the Taiwan
vlog coming I'm still editing it and
then I was in Portland with Mallory and
then just this past week and I was in
sasquatch so for this whole month I've
been basically living out of this one
bag I'm not totally sure if you can buy
this makeup bag they sent this NPR a
couple years ago
and I just realized it still has the
plastic thing on here if I'm not using
this bag I'm using the bag that I posted
on Instagram I think a couple times
they've definitely shown it on snapchat
have like a hanging hair over here okay
I've definitely shown it on snapchat but
I just got out Walgreens and it's just
like a clear zip up bag that's really
great for holding makeup because you can
see everything that's what I brought on
the New York trip last year I think I
showed that in the vlogs but what I look
for in travel bags is basically ones
that are more compact you can just lay
it on top of everything in your suitcase
it's not going to take up a whole lot of
room so even though this one is
obviously pretty large I like that it's
more narrow it zips up and if a guy than
just makeup it also holds my toiletries
too so I just have everything in one
place
so let's get in Syst have not organized
this clean this anything this is after a
month of traveling so it's going to be a
little messy we're just going to have to
live with it so when you open this up it
has this section right here which is
clear this is where I keep all of my
toiletry things I'm not going to be
going through here because it's just
face wash toothpaste razors hair stuff
this side is where magic happens this is
where all my makeup is kept so my makeup
bags actually prefer not a lot of
zippers and sections and things to stick
places I just like it all in one place
so I can kind of see everything and dig
through it so that's exactly what this
makeup bag is as you can see it's kind
of
show that's just what I like to work
with usually when I get somewhere I'll
put all my makeup brushes outside either
on the counter or in like a cup or
something and have kind of my
foundations laid out on the counter or
something but for the most part I just
like to keep everything in here so I'm
just going to dig in actually thinks
we're going to do brushes first brushes
I just try and go as minimal as possible
I just have one brush for one thing
these are kind of my necessary brushes
the FIR foundation I brought my ELF
brush is technically not a foundation
brush but I love it from foundation it
works awesome it'll be linked down below
along with everything else I'm talking
about and then my other tool for
applying foundation I brought was this
morphe sponge which I feel like I've
raved about in past few videos I love
this my morphe G 38 for concealer holy
grail brush and then an elf brush to set
my under eye powder to what to powder my
under eyes there we go I actually have
to contour brushes in here I threw this
one in here for sasquatch because it's
really compact and tiny anyways I tested
this in the Amazon makeup video I just
did and I used it today all of the
makeup on my face right now is all in
this bag just so you guys can see what
it looks like wet and wild contour brush
just if this one didn't totally blend it
morphe y5 is what I use for blush it's
perlis or for less for less cb4 is my
all-over powder brush lately highlight
Sigma fo3
and I actually only bring three
eyeshadow brushes I feel like you can
pretty much create any look with these
three brushes versus the morphe 27 this
is just a basic blending brush second is
the more feet are thirty-ninth
like a crease kind of brush and then
Sedona lace 904 I love this for blending
out my lower lash line I bring a bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candle lid to mix my
foundation off and just wipe it clean
with a makeup remover wipe afterwards so
foundation is where I get a little
excessive she's surprised keep in mind
when I was traveling in China as testing
out a bunch of the white foundation
mixers so if I was just traveling on my
own and I didn't do YouTube and I wasn't
trying out a bunch of products I would
just bring like one or two foundations
and probably a lot less makeup since I'm
constantly testing out different
products this is a lot of makeup to
bring on a trip I'm aware with that
being said I have different foundations
in here for different purposes
after a few mixers in here since I'm
still trying this out in the white mixer
video by the way is coming next week I
believe on Wednesday so it's passing in
a sasquatch my most reach for combo was
the covergirl vitalist on
station in 710 they actually do have a
Seminole five shade I haven't been able
to find it yet if I mix this with the
Lancome teint Idole ultra 24-hour makeup
and zero nine zero this combo was
amazing it gave me full coverage
beautiful finish I don't like the
Lancome one on its own it's way too
matte and gives me like weird textures
but mixed with this it was a beautiful
combination it lasted amazing and the
heat it was like 90 degrees super hot
super sweaty we were outside in the Sun
like all day this combo worked really
well for me there
I also brought the Laura Geller cover
lock foundation just because this one is
totally foolproof for me the only thing
with this is that it's not long-lasting
so I mostly would use this one if I just
am going out like at night this one I
like mixing to add coverage and just
smoothness I love this foundation and
then this one is another mixing one for
me that I always bring when I'm
traveling just a covergirl clean matte
BB cream and five times don't like this
on its own not enough coverage for me
and it's way too dark but for mixing
this thing keeps you so freakin matte
and it just has a beautiful finish if
you get really oily especially in the
heat this is awesome too mixed in with
different products so primer I brought
my highlight my can I say this Heil
amide there we go I've been saying hi
mal I'd definitely hilum I'd 12-hour
visible oil blocker primer this is by
DCM I believe it's how you say their
name they're the same brand that makes
the ordinary foundation which I ordered
three weeks ago I've got so many
requests from you guys to do that in a
foundation Friday video I've ordered
that weeks ago I had to email their
customer service and basically they're
back ordered and like out of stock until
June so as soon as I get that foundation
I'll be reviewing it but it's probably
gonna be a while but this I freaking
love I actually feel like this helps
control my oil throughout the day if you
have oily skin try this thing out
brought two concealers which actually
now I brought three I brought three
concealers which is definitely excessive
but I have different cues for each one
so Tarte shape tape never does me wrong
had to bring this I also brought the BH
Studio Pro concealer this is the new
total coverage concealer I brought this
because I just recently discovered this
and I've been really liking it but if it
didn't work out for whatever reason I
wanted to back up which is why I brought
chart shape tape but this is awesome
super affordable great coverage
moisturizing until it sets then it gives
you that kind of effect that Tarte shape
tape does and then this thing is like my
holy grail product now when I'm not
wearing makeup I would say for probably
about 15 days half this month I didn't
wear any makeup between my micro bladed
brows and lash extensions I just wasn't
really feeling makeup I just wanted to
get out and go live and not spend an
hour doing makeup every morning when I
was traveling so it's just been really
nice to be able to use this just on my
acne it's the same exact color as my
skin tone for me so it just blends
really well all I do is spot conceal
with this and then blend it out with the
morphe G 38 brush it just makes my acne
and my skin covered enough to go outside
but I don't have to wear any foundation
and it's just nice to be able to touch
my face and be in the Sun and be
sweating and not worrying about like
foundation sliding all over the place
brought a few mixers in here since like
I said I've been testing them out next
Pro Foundation mixer in white the body
shop lightening drops and then my Manic
Panic dreamtone Oh found another brush
and another concealer this is what I
used to carve out my brows this is the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
illumination in the shade light I hate
this for underneath my eyes it is so
freakin thick but because it's super
thick and full coverage it works awesome
for carving out your eyebrows I use this
concealer brush kind of thing to carve
it out brow products I've been using
every day for the past few months I feel
like has been the benefit precisely my
brow pencil in the shade for Wis benefit
gimme brow I either use this or the Ulta
brow gel in dark or might be deep the
darker shade so eye shadow I feels what
I do a pretty good job of not taking too
much for to sasquatch with soap &amp;amp;
Glory so I wanted to have like my
full-on eyes shadow and be able to do
full face and makeup and stuff but if I
wasn't I would have literally just used
my bronzer or contour shade as eye
shadow but because I was doing makeup
and we're doing some filming and stuff
there I just brought two eyes shadow
palettes these are the little pellets by
morphe I don't think they make these
anymore which I'm really bummed about
because these things freaking rock not
only are they great for traveling
because they're the perfect size and
they're super compact the shadows in
here are awesome I just bring these too
because you have pretty much all the
warm tone shades you need in there and
then this palette you get all your cool
toned smoky shades
this is mama drama and this is copper
popper I really hope you bring these
back morphe that would be great I think
those are the only eyeshadows I brought
I brought this Bastilla
liquid glitter this is the Magnificent
metals and diamond dust
this thing is so versatile it changes
or to whatever I shadow you have
underneath it I feel like this is
perfect for traveling if you want a
little pop if you're going to be going
out you want some glitter doesn't have
fallout if you use it as your last step
don't be blended eyeshadows after this
use this as your last last step and
it'll stay on has super minimal fallout
for glitter I brought two condors lash
bronzer shades just because they're both
tiny I don't know probably didn't need
this one but whatever this one is what
I'm wearing right now in my cheeks this
is the freedom Pro contour kit in the
shade medium the shade I love and I also
really love this Sigma this is
technically a blush or awesome as like a
bronzer contour if you have more
fair-skinned this is the mellow powder
blush I love using this on my cheeks and
also in my crease it's what I have on
right now in my crease for highlighter I
brought the jcat you glow girl in Bella
Rose you guys know I'm obsessed with
this thing not only is this a stunning
highlight if you really want that pop
but it's awesome for your inner corner
as well when I'm traveling I always try
and bring things that can be
multi-purpose just so you have to pack
less products and this one you can use
this eyeshadow I have it on my inner
corner right now I brought my ELF
illuminating palette which is what I
have one right now because I wanted
something that it could wear just more
natural kind of toned down if I had a
really intense eye going or if I just
wasn't feeling like the you glow girl
kind of highlight this shade is what I
use I've majorly hit pan on this you can
also use these shades of eyeshadow
stargazer press powder of course to set
my under eyes then I only brought one
powder which is the Maybelline mapmaker
powder I really like this I actually
feel like this keeps me super matte I
think this is kind of comparable to the
Rimmel stay matte powder this I got in
London so I'm not sure if you can get it
in the u.s. I think I found this on eBay
before I'll link it down below if I can
find it anywhere online so I have the
shade 10 classic ivory it's light enough
which is rare for powder and it has a
really pretty soft matte finish the
finish of this kinda reminds me of the
Maybelline better skin powder as you can
see the lighter shade is a better skin
is much darker than this one Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot is what I use to prime
my eyes this has just always been my
go-to primer but if you want it to be
good and not pack that you could just
use your concealer
don't know why I even brought this
because I can't wear mascara on my upper
lashes with the lash extensions this is
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
it's my Holy Grail mascara this is what
I use on my bottom lashes Wet n Wild
mega links setting sprays these are not
my favorite I just brought them because
they were the only travel sized little
spray things I had this is the
Scandinavia setting spray this one is
total
like I like Scandinavia it's just not my
absolute favorite setting spray and then
this is the Mehran barrier spray
holy cease this stuff is so intense
I think this is the most chemical
smelling thing I've ever put on my face
you really can't breathe for good 30
seconds after you spray this one of you
guys recommended this for oil for just
like long-lasting makeup and I do feel
like it really keeps your makeup on I
would not use this on an everyday basis
probably just want to hold off for like
special events where you really need
your makeup stay on if you are not
sensitive to scents this is no joke you
guys almost like toxic status the way it
smells Physicians Formula I booster for
my liquid liner
the only blush I brought is Tarte doll
face just because I feel like this is
super versatile it's just like a baby
pink shade that goes pretty much
anything wearing it right now hair clip
to face melted matte and cool girl which
is what's on my lips right now I just
love this one for traveling because can
dress it up as like a night lipstick or
I feel like it's not too intense for the
daytime if you just want like a deeper
nude this is one of those lipsticks that
looks totally different on everyone if
you have a similar skin tones of mine is
obviously more of a deep nude but the
Too Faced melted matte liquid lipstick
formula is one of my favorites another
favorite look of lipstick formulas be
hue they're the brand that I
collaborated to make 1548 but this is
the shade pretty penny it's just a
beautiful kind of brick oranjee red I
love this for summer it looks really
pretty with like a gold kind of smoky
ice the formula these are just killer
these two our must-haves for me this is
a Sephora liquid lip in the shade 32 oh
I definitely also brought my wet and
wild cat suit but I think that's in my
purse but I had the cat suit in nudie
patooty also also can code out is the
MUA lip gloss and baby pink then I
brought Pierre obey or wear this in the
Amazon makeup video but this is
definitely darker than this flora and
the wet and wild cats ooh this is what I
wear if you want something like
in-between it's a little bit pinky or
peachy err have some bobby pins
straggling down here but that is
everything my makeup bag is now unpacked
now I just need to put this away so
