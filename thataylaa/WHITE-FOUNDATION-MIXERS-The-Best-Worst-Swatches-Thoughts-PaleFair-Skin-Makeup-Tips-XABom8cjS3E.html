right now who cannot talk today so I
don't film in the afternoon ever more
coffee
all right so today we have the very
long-awaited white mixer video we're
going to be talking all about white
foundation mixers I think I've been
saying I'm going to do this video for
like a year we're here so I've actually
been testing out these white mixers for
the last about a month and a half since
foundation know since 15 days the
foundation ended because I want to
actually tell you what I like and don't
like about each one and give my full
sauce on them rather than just showing
you that they exist this is going to be
kind of a more in-depth video not just
about the actual white mixers but about
how they mix the foundations and
different types and just things that are
helpful to know so I have a whole two
pages of notes here did a shift on the
research for this video so I hope some
of this stuff helps you guys out if
you're excited for this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and if
you're new here you can join the BAE
Rito family and subscribe I upload
Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. Pacific
time so if you're new to the mixer world
there are basically different foundation
mixers that you can use to lighten
darken or just alter the color of your
foundation whether it's adding more
yellow or more red or in my case usually
white so if you're fair-skinned is this
can be a lifesaver because you can
basically mix in a white product to help
lighten your foundation even if you
don't have fair skin you can use these
products to help kind of bring your
summer shade of foundation into winter
if you need to lighten it and you don't
want to go out and purchase a new shade
you can use it to lighten our adjust
your foundation you'll see the
foundation dark nurse to darken your
winter shade for summer if you are
someone who gets tan that is not me but
people get tan in this world so I think
something super important that we need
to start out with is just the basics so
there are three main types of foundation
oil-based water-based in silicone base
so oil and water we all know don't mix
science so if you have a water-based
foundation you're going to want to pair
that with probably a water-based or
silicone based mixer and primer same
goes for oil based foundations there's
not a whole lot of oil based foundations
out there anymore
typically you find foundations that are
silicone based and then there are a few
water-based foundations so what that
means is it is probably ideal to try and
find a mixer that is the same base as
your kind of go-to foundation or
whatever you're using that day just so
it mixes the best it's not going to have
any separation so I went through the
ingredients on each foundation mixer to
try and figure out which kind of base it
is but if you need to figure out what
kind of base your foundation is it's
fair
simple it can be a little bit tricky and
overwhelming at first but after I did
Suntory ting I think I found an easiest
way to figure it out this is just what
I've learned from my research if I am
wrong at all definitely feel free to
correct me down below or help each other
out the way that you can tell if it's a
silicon-based foundation is basically if
it has any significant amount of words
with cone or sill o in it so a lot of
the times if you look at the ingredients
of a foundation water or aqua will be
first on the list that doesn't mean that
it's necessarily a water-based
foundation water is typically used to
give the foundation that liquidy
consistency so even though ingredients
are listed from greatest to leave so
foundation might have the most amount of
water it doesn't mean it's a water-based
foundation 100% of the time you see
glycerin in there that's likely a
water-based foundation but a foundation
can also have glycerin and silicone
ingredients in there
so here's an example of a water-based
foundation that has aqua listed as the
first ingredient and also has glycerin
in here and there's not a whole lot of
silicone ingredients in here if any I
didn't see any so in this video I'm
doing swatches of each mixer and kind of
showing you how they mix with the
foundation to keep it consistent I
wanted to stick with the same foundation
as the Milani conceal and protect
two-in-one foundation this is in their
new lightest shade 0/0 this is
definitely not light which is why I'm
using it to test with the mixers it is
silicone based and has pretty high
coverage and is fairly opaque so it's
just good to test with different mixers
so when I did these swatches I tried to
use the same amount of mixer with the
foundation just so we can compare them
all so I think the question I get asked
the most about foundation mixers is
what's the best one that's not going to
alter the formula of my foundation and I
feel like if you think about it anything
that you mix in with something is likely
going to alter the formula because
you're adding something to it just like
any foundation these mixers also have
different finishes they're going to have
different coverage a bit I feel like
there's definitely different mixers that
are going to perform best with different
foundations but I do have a couple
standout ones that I think are pretty
good across the board blush a minute
talking about the actual mixers what I
like about each one the price points
swatches all of that jazz I could really
go for maple doughnut right now the
first to watch I'm going to show you in
all of them is going to be about 1 to 1
ratio foundation to mixer and then the
last watch is going to be just the
foundation mixer on as
just so you can see the coverage and
kind of get an idea if it's more sheer
what the finish looks like all right so
this first one I want to start out with
because I've talked about this on my
channel for years this was kind of what
I used before any other foundation mixer
I think this was kind of my go-to one
for years in last few years there
definitely been way more foundation
mixers coming out it's actually a thing
now so they're definitely a ton more
options now but I wanted to start with
this one since I've talked about it for
the longest and I do have kind of new
sauce on it actually so this is the
Manic Panic dreamtone foundation this
one you can get for about nine bucks on
Amazon I went to Twitter to ask you guys
which base you think this is because I
could not figure it out says that it's
oil free but there is two hobo oil in
here there is no silicone so according
to you guys on Twitter you can get
safest to say that this is a water-based
mixer so this years ago I loved it had a
great consistency it mixed well with the
majority of my foundations I'm 99% sure
they've recently or at least in the last
six months changed the formula this
because this is now very liquidy it was
never like this before this is pretty
liquidy I mean it drips down now which
it never used to do is kind of like a
thicker cream formula before I don't
know if the new ones I just got were
kind of duds or what but I actually had
a few guys on Twitter say the exact same
thing so this one I'm not super into
anymore I definitely preferred how it
used to be
things I don't like about this new
formula is that it's runny I don't feel
like I get quite as good of coverage
with this new formula the other one I
would say is high medium coverage this
one I would say on its own is closer to
high low coverage or even low medium
coverage that's all right low medium
coverage yes if you have the old formula
great do I think it's worth it to buy
the new formula of this probably not I
think there are ones that I like better
on here so it's next one is the LA girl
Pro coverage HD illuminating foundation
so I actually have a whole foundation
line and then they added this white
mixer to it I did a whole video on this
so this retails for between about eight
and nine dollars it is cruelty free on
their website they say that this formula
is full coverage to me looking at the
ingredients on this one I would say it's
a silicone base this one I feel mixes
beautifully doesn't have any kind of
weird separation it gives a really
pretty luminous finish has pretty decent
coverage my only downside to this one is
that I'm pretty sure breaks me out
is a bummer because I feel like this
would kind of be my go-to mixer if it
didn't this next one is the NYX Pro
foundation mixer in white they do have a
darker shade for darkening your
foundation in this this retails for
about 10 bucks it is cruelty free and as
far as the base I'm pretty sure it's the
same kind of situation as this one I
think it's a hybrid water silicone
possibly just silicone this one mixes
well I just feel like it's not the most
opaque so shear out my foundation quite
a bit I don't get nearly as good of
coverage as I do with this one but I do
feel like it has more of a neutral kind
of finish to it I would say this is a
satin finish whereas this one is
definitely more luminous don't hate it
don't love it for me I rather use
something that I have to use a little
bit less of and that gives me more
opaque color next is a stargazer white
foundation you can get this off of
Amazon if you ordered the under eye
setting posit that I use you probably
got it with this because it comes in
kind of like a pack thing for like 10
bucks on Amazon cruelty free this one
looking at the ingredients was really
hard for me to figure out what kind of
base it is it's definitely not oil-based
but I can't figure out if it's water a
silicon-based downside to this is that
it's a little bit messy doesn't have a
pump doesn't have a squeeze tube just
gives you a little spatula thing and I
clearly have foundation up there I think
the only foundation that I've actually
preferred this mixer with is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer there's something about
these two together that just worked
really well but I feel like almost every
other foundation I've tried to mix this
with I don't like it it makes it a
little weird it's almost like it's not
chunky but there's definitely some
chunks going on in there you get a
little bit of separation until you fully
blend it so is this one worth getting I
would say only if this is your like Holy
Grail foundation and you're pretty much
only going to be using these two
together next up is the body shop shade
adjusting drops I actually have a whole
video on this when it first came out I
did a review on it these retail for 20
bucks the body shop is cruelty free I
think these work really well at
lightening your foundation and mixing in
with products the only thing is that I
feel like the dropper is kind of
redundant to me when a product comes in
a dropper you should only have to use a
dropper - I actually end up using the
same amount of this product as something
like this just to get the same kind of
lightening so I feel like I would just
go through this super fast if I was
frequently using this that's a big
downside and then there's obviously the
price tag so I just feel like for 20
bucks you'd probably go through this
pretty
fast I would say the finish of this one
is closest to a satin finish next up is
the face Atelier I always want to say
our Tilley a it's actually called ultra
foundation Pro I have a little sample
cup here because you can get the samples
for $1 and the full-size bottle retails
for $36 so if you're trying this out
definitely want to get a sample Cup
first I did a whole foundation Friday
video on the actual foundation and the
mixers a bunch of different color mixers
this kind of a professional brand it is
vegan and cruelty free and it's silicone
based so overall this one reminds me
almost exactly of the LA girl Pro mixer
the way that it blends out the opacity
of it just the whole feel of this and
everything reminds me almost exactly of
this except the price is obviously very
different like I haven't given this one
enough of a shot to know if this breaks
me out or not so if it doesn't that
would be great because I would
definitely choose this one over this one
if my skin liked it better something
that breaks me out might be totally fine
on you but if you're someone who has
sensitive acne prone skin just keep that
in mind this next one is the only
oil-based mixer that I have here this is
a makeup forever chromatic mix I
actually have water-based and oil based
formulas of this which I did not know I
actually got this off of glambot so I
didn't really have a choice between
oil-based or water-based I just white
mixer and bought it but now knowing that
I would definitely go with water-based
over oil-based especially if you have
acne prone skin this one I just do not
get a whole lot of use out of because
it's oil-based it's not super opaque
either
I can't imagine the water one being
super different with its coverage or
anything so as far as the coverage and
the opacity this one is kind of a thumbs
down for me when I added in a decent
amount of this it didn't lighten that
well and you only get less than half an
ounce of product in here because of that
this one I'm not that into and mega
fiber is also not cruelty free they do
sell in China so this one is actually
pretty great this is the makeup designer
ehg err liquid makeup this was intended
to be like airbrush makeup I got this at
IMATS and the lady said that I could use
it as a mixer as well like without the
whole airbrush system which is why I
picked it up this one retails for $18 in
its silicone base this thing packs a
punch as far as the drop mixers you
definitely have to use less products
than both of these drop ones to body
shop and a makeup forever I feel like
this is how drop mixers should be you
literally just
a drop or two pretty opaque I've tried
this one out with about four different
foundations every time it's mixed well
they can't find a whole lot of
information on this brand so I'm not
sure if the brand as a whole is cruelty
free but I did find a blog post saying
that they're Pro line of makeup is
cruelty free slash up as far as mixers
ideas a few other things I want to show
you but Blast two mixer I use this as a
mixer is the Misha signature complexion
coordinating BB cream so this is
interesting it's basically a white BB
cream it comes out looking like vanilla
bean like it has a little specks of
black in there almost when you blend it
out you can't see the specs at all it
doesn't actually adjust your skin tone I
kind of got this thinking see they're
going to be like a shade adjusting
product where it goes on white and then
adjust your skin tone or it's just going
to be a white mixer and it really is
just like a white BB cream but things I
like about this it mixes great it's
creamy it's pretty pigmented as far as
coverage I still think it's less than
this one I would say this is more like
medium I also like that this one has SPF
in it it has SPF 43 which is a random
number Misha is not a cruelty-free brand
at a retails for $34 on Misha's website
I think you can find it cheaper on
Amazon that's where I got it what I
gathered is that I'm pretty sure this
one is water-based it has 30% Lotus
water in it it's what I'm actually
wearing right now mixed with the Milani
foundation it took me two layers of this
combination to get full coverage but I
definitely love the finish that this
adds it gives you kind of a luminous BB
cream creamy kind of finish so didn't
swatch these ones but I wanted to just
kind of mention them as an option is it
mixing in white concealer you can also
use concealers to mix in with your
foundations for me I find that it gives
me a little bit too much texture since
my skin is already textured and I have
acne typically mixing in concealer
doesn't work the best for me I'd rather
just use a foundation mixer but Kat Von
D makes a white concealer I also have
the LA girl Pro HD concealer I did a
video actually comparing these two
products and this one I actually haven't
tried it I believe I got this on shot
misses by the knobby brand I think this
was a dollar as far as white stick
foundations I'm still in the hunt so let
me know if you have found a good white
stick foundation I know Mac makes one
but this is the Marilyn cream blend
stick foundation I do not recommend this
this thing I do not like it all kinda
reminds me of greasy Halloween makeup
almost I tried mixing this in with my
makeup rubber stick foundation the jelly
stick foundation it just doesn't look
great
not recommend this I'd hold off until
you find a better white stick foundation
or even just mix in a little bit of a
liquid mixer those are all the products
that I wanted to talk about this is
definitely not every foundation mixer in
the world
I know Illamasqua makes one I haven't
picked that one up because I do have
their skin based foundation I believe
it's called and I don't like it reminds
me of the Kat Von D lock-it foundation
it's super thick gave me a ton of
texture so I didn't want to purchase the
white mixer but I think out of all the
mixes I talked about I have four that I
would kind of recommend over the others
for a drugstore option I think I would
say the LA girl Pro coverage I think
overall this one is the best and then
the other three I would recommend is the
face of Tilley a the makeup designer II
and ameesha so I think I hit on
everything that I wanted to tell you
guys I hope I didn't forget anything
just went through a ton of
information you have any questions let
me know down below in the comments we
can help each other out I hope you guys
