little makeup adventure and go to Whole
Foods I want to get a bunch of the
makeup to try out in this video for you
guys I thought I would kind of vlog the
shopping experience today is actually
Easter Sunday so it's either gonna be
totally packed or totally empty right
now I'm hoping for the latter or closed
might be closed I don't think I've ever
even looked in that section at Whole
Foods so if you're excited for this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up if you're new here you can join the
BAE Rito family and subscribe upload
every Monday Wednesday Friday 6 p.m.
Pacific time let's go do some whole food
shopping
oh yeah
you need a ladder blonde she's 24
[Laughter]
Zuzu that's very natural
it's a highlighting
cutter as you like that's lucky that one
both sites
wait you should be worried about gluten
on your face
oh wow
you'd go broke if you're shopping here
for your makeup really though
that's rough
disobey time
whoo yeah I think so could not tell you
about full tons of fun times
where you can use cheese okay
in price cheese
a little bag much better yeah all right
so it's a couple days later I have my
bag of Whole Foods beauty products here
it's a 3:30 right now it has been a day
let me tell you we're gonna crack a
Corona right now don't do monetize me a
tube nothing quite says I don't belong
in Whole Foods like a Canon Corona
don't let this small bag fool you so
we're gonna be trying out eight items I
did not pick up a full face of makeup
because that would have been the price
of a new car
my total 170 dollars and 35 cents
so my Whole Foods was pretty picked
through as you guys saw in the footage
but skincare was stocked up they had a
shit ton of skincare so I picked up two
things from the skincare I'll see a cure
incredibly clear sheet mass it has BH a
white willow and cucumber nothing this
stood out to me about this is that it
has DHA in it just beta hydroxy acid I
don't think I've ever tried a sheet mask
that had a che or PHA so I'm super
excited try this I think we're gonna try
this out at the end of the night because
this is not something that you'd want to
wash off afterwards but this sheet mask
was $4.99 but the product we're gonna
start out with is the Alba Botanica
even advanced daily cream so when I had
acne before accutane and by the way
you're not supposed to use be a chaise
or a chaise when you're on accutane but
I really have a few days left at this
point and I've already been starting to
kind of do that but when I had acne one
of my favorite face washes was by Elba
so I was kind of drawn to this cream and
then I smelled the tester in store and
it smells so good it almost smells like
a salon conditioner to me it's cruelty
free it says no parabens and 100%
vegetarian ingredients it doesn't say
it's fragrance free and it definitely
definitely smells like there's fragrance
in it so that's kind of a downside
because fragrance can irritate your skin
so in bold on this box it says where's
well under makeup which is why I wanted
to try sout before putting on my
foundation marine complex fortifies the
skin reduces the appearance of
blotchiness help still sleepy skin
become fresh even and bright in just two
weeks by dipping my finger in it doesn't
feel like a super thick cream
I'm curious how my skin is gonna react
to this scent though the fragrance feels
super smooth and almost like feels kind
of like buttery soft it was actually a
little bit like the Murad hydrodynamic
ooh this feels good
Wow it's making my skin feel hella soft
so I have dry skin I'm gonna still spray
my Too Faced setting spray underneath
just to prep my skin like I always do
since I'm gonna be trying a foundation
too obviously it's 3:30 p.m. which I'll
explain how so we're not gonna do like a
10 hour wear test like I do in
foundation Fridays but I'm still gonna
keep this on as long as possible tonight
by the way I'm wearing a turtleneck
today in spring because I realized I'm
really excited for spring weather but I
still have like 20 sweaters and
turtlenecks I wanted to wear not
prepared so turtleneck in April okay so
this bad boy this foundation was $32.99
this is the mineral fusion minerals on a
mission flawless full coverage
age-defying makeup does it's
hypoallergenic and paraben free medium
to full coverage it says up here I have
the lightest shade neutral one I believe
there was also a cool one there might
have been a warm one to this brand
mineral fusion out of all the brands
they're seeing the priciest some of
their blushes were like 30 bucks
everything was very pricey which I don't
know why I was thinking makeup at Whole
Foods would be like a little bit more
reasonably priced than everything else
that Whole Foods but I wasn't thinking
it was gonna be this pricey so I'm gonna
shake some of us out on oh okay this is
thick the way this is coming out or not
coming out reminds me of Mac Studio Fix
for how thick this is we definitely need
a pump here mineral fusion there we go
I'm gonna start out with my sponge on
one side of my face and then a brush on
the other side weird when I dip my
sponge in it actually now feels pretty
thin I have tried a few like mineral
makeup lines in the past and I have not
found a foundation that I like actually
did a whole video testing out Etsy
makeup from different sellers with a
sponge this is definitely light coverage
look at my neck though the shade is
pretty good definitely feels a lot more
thin than I was expecting trying to get
it out of the bottle hopefully we'll get
a little better coverage with a brush
looking pretty mad like a satin matte
finish right now let's try brush I've
now used up that amount that I first put
out I just got like a mound whoops
that's the problem with these bottles I
can't control how much comes out wow
this is looking hella streaky with the
brush super streaky hmm I don't know in
what world this is supposed to be full
coverage got a little bit better
coverage with the brush you can see oh
yeah it totally covered my redness
better on this side I would say this
side looks like medium coverage with the
brush and then this side definitely
looks like light coverage my forehead is
looking a little rough so kind of
building this up with a sponge on my
forehead so streaky this is like streak
City over here why doesn't my forehead
look so much more yellow than the rest
of my face I do feel like that just
built up a lot Wow I have like three
different shades going on and three
different levels of coverage so I'm
gonna try and build this side up this is
turning very very yellow so what
happened this morning I was planning on
filming this video first thing in the
morning I'm gonna build up this side a
little bit more now my disk space got
totally full so I went to do what I
usually do and delete all my backups on
Final Cut Pro does they automatically
save and take up a shit ton of disk
space and deleted the most recent backup
and the rest of the backups and my
entire Final Cut library so I deleted
three projects that I was working on
thank God I still had all the footage on
my memory cards so I just have to
re-edit them spend all this money on
software trying to recover everything
and it didn't work cool just lost like
25 hours of work looks super textured
and just kind of cake you up there
and a bit to make up B it looks okay you
can still see scarring and freckles
coming through I definitely would not
call this full coverage is nowhere near
full coverage built up with two layers I
got it to medium coverage but I would
more say this is buildable light to
medium coverage I am NOT into how this
is sitting on my skin I'm just setting
my under eyes with a mix of my normal
Physicians Formula powder and then the
brake
powder by kqw Wow my face what the heck
dude I swear it's still yeah it's
definitely still oxidizing good thing
I'm wearing a turtleneck powder it looks
really nice on top though I think I'm
gonna set my whole face make everything
even from far away from me it looks
really nice with the powder on I'm not
sure how it looks for you guys but when
I look really up-close it just looks
very makeup II it actually looks like
how Mac Studio Fix looks on my skin it
looks pretty heavy
so first off on this foundation not
really likin anything about this one at
this point I don't like how it streaks
and kind of moves around it's definitely
not the coverage that it says it is and
it just looks pretty heavy on my skin
keep in mind I did do two layers because
I wanted to get the coverage that it
said it was but even on that first layer
it just wasn't sitting the best on my
skin so this one isn't one of the eight
products that I purchased at Whole Foods
but they sell this at Whole Foods so I
wanted to mention it because this is a
setting spray you can use this it's
technically the facial spray but you can
use it underneath or over your makeup -
it's just rose water and glycerin
and I really like this is from Amazon
the only thing is that my spritzer is
totally like messed up so I'm going to
use this to kind of hopefully settle the
powder and the liquid foundation a
little bit together again this isn't a
foundation review not like isolated in
the foundation here we're just trying
out some wholefoods makeup kind of just
have to take a shower in it hoping this
adds a little bit of life back into my
skin right now okay that definitely
helped I might even add a little bit
more give me all the glycerin today that
made my skin looks so much better has a
little bit of a glow to it and it did
just kind of melt those together picked
up a blush and a highlight but bronzer I
also was trying to find and the only
bronzers I saw were things that looked
like face powders but were called
bronzers they were so light that it
would have been like a face powder even
on my skin tones I don't know if they
just mislabeled them and they were
supposed to be face powders but they
definitely were not bronzer shades I'm
just going in with a little bit of my
bronzer right now this one's by Laura
Geller this is sunrise fair need to try
that row spray more over makeup because
that just gave me such a pretty glow so
I'm excited to try this blush it's by
the mineral fusion brand the same brand
that did the foundation and it's in the
shade pale luxuriously
Minerals offer a natural flush of color
to brighten the complexion and create a
youthful healthy glow so the shaded
store looked pretty light as a shade
looks really pretty so let's go and I'm
just first gonna lightly tap because I
don't know how pigmented this is gonna
be so this blush was $24.99 oh it's
pretty though okay I would totally use
that blush again I think that's a super
pretty shade it looks like you have a
little bit of color to your cheeks but
it doesn't look like you're wearing a
crap ton of blush I like how this one
has a tiny bit of luminosity too but
it's not quite as glowy as like the
ciatÃ© summer love blush which is one of
my favorites of glow to blushes but this
one definitely isn't as glowy has that
one but you can see in the light it does
have like a sheen to it how much product
do you get in this so for $25 you get
0.1 ounces of product so let's compare
some blushes in this laura geller blush
that looks like it's about the same size
you get 0.17 in NARS free so you get
0.16 and then in Physicians Formula
butter blush you get 0.26 wow that's a
lot so this has the least amount of
product and it is $25 in this packaging
also this feels like Dollar Tree
packaging nothing against Dollar Tree
makeup there's been some good finds
there but it definitely feels pretty
cheap for a highlight this looked like
something that was right up my alley
when I was watching things in Whole
Foods this is the Zuzu luxe mosaic
illuminator when I was playing around
with this it looked like a very natural
kind of subtle highlight which I really
like that especially for just kind of
everyday makeup oh this looks a lot
darker than I remember it
what's going on okay that looked a lot
lighter in stores is this the wrong
shade it says light we'll see how this
is on my face it might be one that looks
totally different in the pan than it
does on the skin their logo to me looks
like it should be like a soap brand I'm
gonna go with my favorite highlight
brush this is a sigma fo3 and just do
whoa that was hella powdery I just
swirled it in there and a lot came up oh
this is definitely dark just created
like a dark stripe on my skin okay so
I'm gonna kind of blend this down as
like a blush topper maybe
since that's definitely too dark as a
highlight
it almost looks darker than it did even
on my finger swatch yeah you can see
like the line right there so I'm gonna
have to blend another highlight over
that so instead I'm gonna use this as a
blush Stoppers so I'm switched back to
this brush and just kind of I don't know
if I like this it's not really blending
out it's kind of just like staying there
this for sure it looks more like a
bronzer it doesn't say bronzer anywhere
it says illuminator and this is the
lightest shade so definitely wouldn't
call this an illuminator so whenever I'm
doing my makeup and something like this
happens I'll just take my same powder
brush without product on it first and
just try and blend it out and this
usually works and then if not I'll go in
with a little bit of face powder on the
brush but this seems to be yeah that's
helping cuz whatever leftover powder it
just kind of like tones everything down
and blends it together
that's definitely helping I'm gonna go
back in with the blush though because
that just took away some of the blush
now yeah this blush was really pretty so
for a highly I'm just gonna take NARS
free Sol blush I actually like using
this as a highlight too with this brush
and it just gives you a really pretty
natural pinky kind of glow nothing too
intense just more subtle so I do have an
eye shadow to test out so I'm gonna prep
my eyes using my Mac Paint Pot they had
a couple different brands that were
carrying eyeshadow and as I was watching
them with my fingers the ones I've felt
the softest and that looked really
pretty and pigmented we're at the
Gabriel brand just as Gabriel again this
looks like it could be a surf brand
what's going on here so this eyeshadow
is in the shade chocolate brown and it
felt so buttery when I was feeling it in
the store it has this nice little wave
design but this one I shadow was $14.99
this is like up there with this is more
expensive the Mac so I'm actually gonna
go in with the illuminator shade and I'm
just gonna dip into one of the darker
shades in here and just blend this into
the crease to start out with kind of
create a little transition shade here I
think what I'm gonna do with that dark
brown as an all-over lid color and kind
of try and blend it up and kind of smoke
it out because I do have a liquid
liner to tryout - this is totally
working as a transition shade I'm first
going to take this on my finger because
that's usually what I do I kind of pack
it on the lid and I'll go in and blend
it up feels really soft and that has
some nice pigment to it it looks like so
I'm just gonna press this on ooh that's
a pretty chocolate has a little bit of
red in there we're just gonna blend that
out this is blending out really nicely
especially for a deep brown shade so now
I'm gonna go with the blush and I'm
gonna use this to warm up the crease a
little bit that looks pretty as eye
shadow it's kind of planning on using
the face highlighter as an inner corner
highlight too but since that one didn't
work out as like a light highlighting
shade I'm just gonna actually go in with
like a matte highlighting shade I'm just
gonna take that same brightening powder
that I used underneath my eyes and just
pop this right on the inner corner to
brighten it without it being like
shimmery so far I like the brown shadow
I think it works totally fine blended
out easily it's pigmented it's soft
would I pay 15 bucks for a single
eyeshadow when I feel like you can get a
lot of colors like this in other
palettes for way cheaper personally
probably not but if this was a brand or
something that you wanted to support
then I could see wish they had like a
full and eye shadow palette there that
would be cool so let's go in with this
zouzou black pearl liquid liner this
eyeliner is $15.99 that's not bad at all
it says this waterproof and it says this
vegan gluten-free and cruelty free I'm
not sure what the requirements are to
get into Whole Foods as a beauty product
as a brand I couldn't find any
information online I tried to look it up
I'm assuming it has to be cruelty free
probably paraben free I'm not sure what
the green Beauty requirements are there
if you know or you find resource or
something leave it down below in the
comments so we can all check it out
okay has like a stiff kind of pointed
applicator looking up close my skin
texture is insane right now mmm this
shade is black pearl they didn't have a
black black one looks to me like this
kind of a satin black which I actually
don't mind sometimes it can make your
eye pop almost looks like a shimmery
gray which is kind of cool
we're doing an intense wing today
apparently yeah this definitely has
almost like a little bit of glitter or
something in it alright that was
actually pretty easy to make the wing I
don't mind the brush at all I like that
it's a little bit stiffer it does feel
like it's not dry yet so I don't want
this to transfer up to my lid it almost
looks like an eyeliner after you've worn
it for like 10 hours just the shade of
it it definitely looks faded and I'll
let's go back in with this brown shade
and I'm gonna take it on a flat edged
brush and just push this right against
my lower lash line I'm just gonna pop on
my usual mascaras
um so my mic died I have no idea where
it stopped recording I feel like the
universe is just telling me to go eat a
burrito and go to bed I knew this was a
good idea so the last makeup product I
picked up was the zuzu luxe lip gloss
this is in the shade liquid bliss then
get out of here almost looks like a
mocha kind of rose gold so I'm excited
for this I want to see how pigmented it
is first so I'm gonna put it on without
any kind of lipstick on this was 1829
again this feels like a really cheap
packaging definitely not fragranced it
doesn't have a good scent to it at all
my lips are pretty chapped right now
from academia definitely pretty sheer
but I feel like I can build this up a
little bit I'm getting a little bit more
color oh oh I just tasted it does not
taste good you can actually smell the
scent on your lips ooh I think this is
one that I would mix in a little bit of
essential oil into it feels very
comfortable it doesn't feel sticky at
all it feels super thin I feel like my
lips are almost like absorbing this yeah
doesn't this look like it's already less
metallic Italy been on for a couple
minutes and I feel like where'd it go so
so far my top two is the elbe daily
cream and then the blush the mineral
fusion blush again
I feel like $24.99 for this is pretty
pricey but it is really pretty and it
blended out beautifully and I like how
just natural and glowy of a blush it is
I would definitely use this again and
this cream I'm excited to try - I'm
gonna look more into the ingredients on
this I usually check cos DNA and then a
couple other things and just make sure
that the ingredients shouldn't irritate
my skin but like I said elba is a brand
that I've had good experiences with in
the past I really liked their acne scrub
so that's my thoughts at this point on
those seven things again we'll do that
face mask at the end of the night so
I'll see you guys then I think I'm gonna
get Chipotle okay so it's 10 o'clock
right now and my face makeup is looking
rough it just came out here to get the
mirror and I feel like you can actually
see a pretty good right here whoa
I just worked out I just joined Jillian
Michaels back on the Jillian Michaels
train I just did level one tonight so I
was like slightly break
sweat you know nothing major it looks so
freakin bad everywhere
totally rubbed off and certain parts of
my face
major Creason right here right here
totally rubbed off around my nose ring I
wasn't really like touching it or
anything right there so I don't know how
that happened
rubbed off down here and just good and
then my forehead holy shit see is what
is happening there though so bad future
creasing right here it just like
literally looks like you could dig a
fork into my forehead right now I'm
assuming that's where there was a little
drip of sweat coming down when I was
working out but even the areas where
like sweat did not touch look so bad so
now I'm gonna shower wash my face and
everything real good and then we're
gonna try out the sheet mask all right
so just showered let's try out this mask
I noticed that it on here does say four
combo toilet skin and I heard dry skin
but I'm just gonna moisturize really
well afterwards I'm a little bit
concerned how is she mask with DHA in it
isn't gonna like drip into your eyes wow
this is sealed deadly tore it from the
outside oh whoa it's like this black
felt it looks really thick black mass is
set for 15 minutes peeling this guard
massage into skin no need to rinse so
sheet masks are only my thing if they
don't move not gonna lie this is a
little bit scary with the DHA the eye
holes are not that big bro oh my gosh
was a smell like it smells like the
inside of a pumpkin
okay so I drove my blender first this is
driven everywhere but it smells like
pumpkin Oh guys definitely like in my
eyeball can't open my eyes
this isn't a very big one usually they
like go right here I'm gonna make it
smoothie the
but I'm gonna leave on for 15 minutes
and I'll be right back
it's kind of stinging have I ever looks
better than I do right now okay so it's
been 15 minutes now my skin is a little
bit Bernie but that's pretty normal with
any kind of har BHA especially like the
first time you do it not to the point
where my face feels like it's on fire
but it's definitely like a little bit
burning it tingly or something so let's
take this off and it says to just rub
rub it all in oh that smells it smells
pretty horrible my face is very glowy so
this is giving me a nice glow but
starting to sink into my skin
and we'll let this sink in for a second
I did make a smoothie Cheers green
smoothie so the tingling is still
definitely going on oh no feel like
something's happening so I'm gonna after
you guys in the description box what I
think of this when I wake up obviously
this isn't something that I can use more
than once cuz it's a one time sheet mask
and the lip gloss by the way literally
looks like I had nothing on my lips in
about ten minutes after having you know
those are my thoughts on some healthy to
be products if you guys enjoyed this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up I mean I'm down below if there are
any other products I should check out
there whether it's makeup skincare
whatever I'm going to call it a night I
