fashion clothing video I think I found
donut a new home back here what do you
guys think he needs his own chair over
here actually have like a bed down here
because sometimes I sleep in this room
full of their story so I did some winter
shopping and shopping for work clothes
and just things that I can wear on both
the weekend and to work I realized like
ninety percent of the clothes I have I
don't actually wear I literally wear
gray white or black every single day so
I don't know why I try and buy colors it
just doesn't work out so I went shopping
if you live in Seattle I went to the
downtown area I never remember what that
mole is actually called they were having
some crazy sales going on i also used my
shop uhler app which i mentioned and how
to save your money video link it over
here but basically shop uhler has been
like my favorite thing these days it's
basically an app that pulls up all the
weekly ads and coupons and sales going
on into one place I really success with
it literally before I go shopping or
every Sunday I look at the weekly sales
a lot of the times he'll just pull up
their app in a store there will be an
instant coupon so why not alright so I'm
going to start with my winter coat I
needed a good jacket that I could wear
in rain and when it's freezing and that
was still semi cute I was looking on
shop uhler and they had a sixty percent
off outerwear deal going on at
Abercrombie of all places I'll nigga
shot to Abercrombie since literally
eighth grade they do have some cute
stuff and they're starting to like
remove the moose from their logo which
is great no one wants to wear a moose
anymore alright so I found this jacket
actually online and I decided to order
Eckstein always return it if it doesn't
fit it is just a zip up down jacket with
a hood which is a plus it fits literally
perfectly I really like how there's a
white zipper because it looks kind of
like the american apparel sweatshirts if
you know i'm talking about it doesn't
have the exact style on the tag right
now is all i get down below if you guys
want
check it out this is in an extra small
this just fits perfectly if you are my
size and you like your jackets a little
bigger I would definitely recommend
getting a small this one fits super snug
and I don't think I could wear like
another jacket under it it's not that
big so keep that in mind it's super warm
its water resistant I think it was
originally like 170 and I got it for a
hundred dollar sixty percent off if
that's correct math so then I went to
old navy because they were having forty
percent off the entire store they have
really great sweaters so I just picked
up a couple tags are off because I have
washed these first is this the first is
this red and white I don't even know
what you call this kind of print it's
just super comfy and it doesn't feel
like one of those itchy materials is
actually like the perfect amount of warm
and not itchy and comfortable they had
this in a couple other colors and I kind
of want to go back and get them because
this is perfect it's also long enough
where if you're wearing leggings it'll
cover your butt which is always nice or
I think so i think with the discount
this was like seventeen dollars yeah
there's what i got from old navy is this
gray and white one it's also super long
this one is a little bit more thick and
warm than the previous sweater this will
be perfect for work and for winter
actually wear this to work the other day
with like a gold statement necklace and
it looked really cute or I think so so
normally I would never go to Banana
Republic because it's just a little bit
out of my price range but I was on
ocular they had a what was it it was
either like a sixty percent off
clearance thing or some huge deal with
clearance so I figured I might as well
check it out you never know what you're
gonna find actually ended up finding
some insane deals and some really cute
clothes for work so the first is this
black and white this is like a sheer
shirt I definitely have to wear a cami
under this as you can see it's just
short sleeve and it has this folded over
thing right here and then it has a nice
gold button in the back this was
originally I want to say like
forty-eight dollars and I ended up
getting it for 15 or 16 that's the first
one then I got this shirt which I
figured I could wear to work this is a
just short sleeve shirt like lacy but
baggy black shirt and I really like it
because his sleeves are long enough and
they're kind of tight but then over like
the rest of the shirt is actually baggy
and I feel like I've never had a shirt
that kind of fits like this but it
somehow works I also really like it
because it's completely lined so I don't
have to wear a cami at all this wasn't
in the clearance section but it was on
sale I think I ended up getting this for
around twenty four dollars and it was
originally like 60 or something crazy
like that last thing I got from banana
republic is this shirt obviously not
really for work I could wear this for
work with like a sweater over it but you
actually think i will because it is
pretty high not going to show the boobs
and i feel like with a sweater it would
work but this is just a black and white
tank top and it crosses over in the back
which i thought was really cute i think
this is around 20 ish dollars on
clearance it's a super nice material and
it is lined on the inside again so i
don't have to wear a cami I don't even
buy shirts like this if I have to wear
cam and red because I feel like it just
looks weird with like straps and a cami
and then your bra strap you know I'm
saying so lastly I ordered some stuff
from whoa there's my address amiclubwear
I still know if you say Amy or am I
whatever it is I'll link it down below
the thing I like about them is that they
have sweaters and stuff but it all fits
really cute somehow it's like the
perfect amount a baggy but it still
gives you like a figure somewhat anyways
let me just show you what I got so the
first sweater I picked out is this red
checkered thing this is super long so I
can't even show you all of it it
actually is the perfect length if you're
short but you still want like a long-ish
sweater usually those like drown me and
I look like I'm wearing a legit
nightgown this one actually fits really
cute and the sleeves are tight the rest
of it is like open and baggy I thought
this would be really cute for winter
with like a black tank top and either
jeans or leggings and boots I've gotta
say this smells kind of funky I
definitely need to wash this thing
another sweater I'm in the sweater mood
it's whether whether you guys black and
white aztec print thing I think that's
what this is called right I really like
this because it's kind of like a
high-low sweater if you guys can see
that it looks like the perfect length in
the front and back it's a little bit on
the scratchy side not like unbearable
scratch
but this is super nice and thick and
warm so I'm excited to wear this thing
right so this was one of those pieces
online that could have gone either
really good or really bad I got this
little thing which actually is adorable
and fits perfectly so it has this like
weird design there's some flowers going
on not really sure what the pattern is
but it's black white tan and gray and
then it has this like pho color thing
going all the way down I don't even know
what you call this but just one those
like slouchy sweaters are like the
contrast between the pattern and then
the fake leather and it actually looks
really cute on and fits like perfectly
this was my favorite thing that I got
from this site also all this stuff was
super reasonable they were having a
forty percent off or fifty percent off
sitewide coupon if you go on their site
just wait until there's a coupon on
there because they pretty much do it
either every week or every other week
the last thing I got which isn't winter
appropriate at all and I'm not really
sure why I got this I think it was like
eight dollars on clearance and I figured
why not shopping addict so it's this
like dress thing interesting collar it
kind of reminds me of like the Spice
Girls or something I thought this would
be really cute for in the summer and I
just like the dark blue and then neon
pink I'm like all about the neons in the
summer I don't know I just couldn't pass
this up and i think the floral pattern
and everything is just adorable alright
so that was everything that I picked up
on that shopping trip and accumulating
another little pile in the corner of my
room so let me know down below if you
