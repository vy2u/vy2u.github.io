all right so a few days ago I talked all
about my favorite the best makeup of
2017 today in honor of foundation Friday
we're going to be talking about my least
favorite foundation launches of 2017 so
for those of you who might be new here I
do foundation Friday every single Friday
on my channel I also do a series called
15 days of foundation which is where I
try out a new foundation for 15 days
I do it every few months so I went
through those playlists and then also my
shadow and schmooze playlist and between
those things I reviewed about 85
foundations this year don't even try and
do the math there because you might cry
I will cry at least it's a write-off so
out of those 85 ish foundations that I
tried out these are the ones that really
stuck out to me that are just pure
these are not all the shitty foundations
I tried out this year these are just the
ones that also launched in 2017 so these
are newer releases with the exception of
one which I'll tell you about so for
about 80% of the year with the exception
of the past couple months since I've
been on accutane I had cystic acne and
combination skin and I would get oily
throughout the day so that's where I'm
coming from as far as my skin type and
everything like I always try to
reiterate these are just my experiences
with these foundations you might love
these you might also hate these everyone
has different opinions on different
products doesn't mean you're wrong and
I'm right doesn't mean I'm wrong and
you're right it's just the world we all
different opinions but that being said
these are products that I personally
despise so I'm gonna go through each of
them tell you why I didn't like him but
I do have dedicated reviews on each one
of these foundations so I'll link them
all down below but if you're excited and
you enjoy this video while you're
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you're new here you can
join the baby doe family and subscribe I
upload every Monday Wednesday Friday 6
p.m. Pacific time here we go so these
are no order at all we're just jumping
in so the first foundation is the NYX
total control drop foundation I don't
even over start first off awesome shade
range with this it comes in 24 shades
that's amazing the thing that really
rubs me the wrong way with this is that
typically with drop foundations they are
pigment drops in way they're more
concentrated so you have to use less
product because they're in a freakin
dropper for example the cover FX custom
cover drops it says that you only need 4
drops to get full coverage with this go
watch that review
but four drops literally did nothing I
think I ended up using about twenty five
drops or something for my whole face I
don't think the end result of this one
looks particularly bad I've seen it look
really great on some people I think what
bothers me is I just don't think this
should be in a dropper I don't think it
should be marketed as like a drop
foundation I think if they just put this
in a bottle with a normal pump and did
one fluid ounce of product there's only
0.43 food once's products in here and
it's 14 bucks that's pretty expensive if
this was a full food ounce that would be
around 28 bucks which would be basically
a high-end foundation so if they just
put this in a standard bottle with a
pump and called it like a matte serum
foundation since it has that thin
consistency and I think would be totally
fine the claims just didn't meet the
reality here to me since the coverage
wasn't there I didn't particularly like
the finish of it and I didn't
particularly like how it sat on my skin
I wouldn't use this as a mixing product
between the marketing and the packaging
and everything with this they just kind
of missed it all right so this next one
oh my gosh I thought Anastacio
subculture was the most polarizing
product of the year I think this one
might be close to it this is the fenty
beauty foundation so in that review
video I go in-depth about why this
didn't work out for me what I think of
it and that was the more recent videos
during my last 15 days of foundation
series so I'm not gonna go too in depth
about this one but this was one of the
worst looking foundations not just of
the year but that I've ever put on my
skin again great shade range I applaud
them there I know the deepest shade goes
really deep and the lightest shade does
go very very light I think I'm about the
third up one in this because I got the
second up and it was still too light
this dries so fast clings to everything
looks extremely dry on my skin is patchy
just pretty much everything you don't
want in a foundation for me now whenever
I see videos like on Instagram using
this it looks good on people's skin and
I've met people like at events recently
that are wearing this foundation and it
looks great on their skin so a lot of
people in the comments on that video are
saying that they love this foundation
and a lot of people were also saying
that they really don't like this
foundation so just looks it looks so bad
on my skin
this next foundation was also tested
during the last 15 News Foundation if
you guys saw the best and worst video of
that series you know that it was kind of
a total fail we had a few winners but
there were definitely more rejects than
raves that month but this is a Sephora
make no mistake foundation and concealer
stick this stick foundation is so
friggin hard to blend out it's literally
a workout it's like you're putting a
Elmer's glue stick on your face and then
trying to blend it out it just kind of
like stays right where you put it I just
don't want to have to work that much to
blend out a stick foundation the make up
for every stick foundation is beautiful
blend out so effortlessly just like
glides and it looks beautiful not only
is this super hard to blend out but on
my skin it looks dry it looks patchy it
clings again and the weird thing with
this one is that it looks super dry when
it's first on my face but then by the
end of the night I was a total
greaseball super super oily and those
kind of products are a little bit
trickier to work with because one I'm
not someone who likes to touch up my
makeup throughout the day it's just not
my thing I don't carry makeup really and
my person actually filming uh what's in
my bag video after this which is kind of
ironic but I'm not someone who likes to
really fuss with my makeup throughout
the day I just like to put it on in the
morning and have it stayed throughout
the day and there are definitely
products that work well for that and
stayed throughout the day on me so it
just doesn't make sense to have to mess
around with something that doesn't and
then this thing is 20 bucks so it's like
for 20 bucks not worth it at all in my
opinion okay I'm gonna go in with this
one next because I'm just I'm too
excited to talk about this one cuz I
have so many feelings about this this is
the one that didn't actually launch in
2017 but the reason I want to mention
this one is because it pretty much did
in the u.s. like it launched a couple
years ago but this was the year that it
really got a ton of hype around it and
people are kind of discovering it for
the first time I hadn't heard about it
at all before this year and I know a lot
of people haven't either before the
BuzzFeed video came out and this was the
Lancome Lancome the tint tlit on
particular a watch the video this
morning custom foundation this friggin
thing this $80.00 piece of plastic $80
so i rewatched this whole video this
morning and
just got refueled up you know I've been
pissed all day about it I did a really
in-depth like twenty-something minute
long review on this where I showed you
guys the machines that was used I walked
through the whole process going into the
Nordstrom counter basically machine
makes your custom shade and formula you
customize the coverage you can customize
everything under sounds whatever for me
eighty dollars for foundations already
it's gotta be friggin amazing but it
would be a semi worth it to me if it got
your exact shade like if the technology
had actually worked the technology aside
the formulas horrible but we'll talk
about that in a second if the technology
worked and actually got my shade right
then maybe like if you never had to mix
the foundation you had the perfect
formula and the perfect coverage and
everything for what you wanted then
maybe that would be worth it but the
machine was a couple shades off couldn't
get the shade right the formula was bad
very bad looked dry patchy I wish they
would just rework this a little bit
because I think it could be really great
but there are just some things that
needed to be changed they really need to
have good lighting at their little booth
things if they're gonna be doing this
because one the customer needs to be
able to see if it actually matches their
neck so that they can correctly adjust
it like we were trying to look under
these yellow lights at the makeup
counter the other thing that really just
rubs me the wrong way with this whole
thing is that they have your complexion
ID in the system which means they have
your custom shade in their computer so
you could call up and say you need a
refill of your foundation and if you
want to refill
it's another eighty dollars they send
you a whole new bottle you can't reuse
this packaging which I understand for
sanitary reasons and whatever but if
you're paying for the technology you
should not have to pay $80 again when
they're literally just scoring out the
foundation they don't have to really do
anything on their end there's nothing
new happening
$80 again for a second bottle is
ridiculous in my opinion so I think this
could have been a really great idea I'm
bummed it wasn't I do want to still try
the match Co and the bareMinerals one so
let me know down below if you guys still
want to see videos on the match Co one
just everything about this like
packaging feels hella cheap the box was
the best part of the whole experience
honestly okay so next up this one
actually just relaunched recently and I
have a video on it have the yarn alize
this is a maybelline superstay
Ridge Foundation I absolutely loved the
old version of the super state
foundation this was one of my favorite
foundations I used this for years
beautiful has a satin really flattering
finish full coverage still this one
looks nothing like it they went way
downhill with the for me on this one in
my opinion this one made my skin look so
crusty and just bizarre like things that
I rarely have happened with foundations
like getting some weird weird things
going on on my nose on top of my nose
just kind of looking weird and heavy
patchy in certain areas just really off
happen with this foundation some of you
guys in the comments were wondering if
those just because my skin was getting
drier when I tried this so I did try
this one again with my dry skin and this
one still looks beautiful on my skin
right now I wish they just launched this
as a different foundation because it is
entirely different than the original
formula which they just kept this and
expanded the shades I don't know why
they just continue this one in the first
place because what's us saying about
killing the good thing or something
I don't know my things now it's gonna
bother me nope not come in Maybelline
you should relaunch this formula as a
different foundation that would be great
so this one was actually posted recently
but it was filmed before accutane so
still when I had oily skin this is the
AP DD long wear liquid pigment if you
watch that video I don't really feel
like I have to explain myself for this
one I actually had to wash off my face
and redo this by mixing it in with
something I should probably talk about
what this is they're supposed to be
liquid pigments again this kind of blew
up on Instagram this brand and then
allure talked about it and all the stuff
so it kind of went viral this year
mostly because of their shade range but
anyway I first tried applying these on
their own I then took them off and try
to playing it mix in with the dermablend
smooth liquid camo which is a very
forgiving foundation and even mix it in
with that it still looked horrible super
heavy cakey it says it's buildable but
it dries to a powder finish so it's
definitely not buildable it dries very
quickly too the coverage really isn't
there for being a liquid pigment it's
also very pricey for the amount of
product that you get in here if I was
them I would kind of just go back to the
drawing board with this one and try and
reformulate it because I love that they
have a great shade range but the
formulas
all right so the last worst launch of
the year for my skin a lot of people
love this one is the LA Colors truly
matte long wearing high pigment
foundation pants the same situation
actually as a maybelline superstay one
for me it just made my skin look so dry
so patchy do we see a theme here by the
end of the day my bronze are in stuff
started getting patchy this just overall
does not sit well my skin at all in the
comments you guys were saying that some
of you found this at Dollar Tree and
Dollar General so if you've been wanting
to try this this might be at your local
store and you can try it for only a
dollar instead of it was six dollars but
I think I ended up paying like just as
much and shipping or something
do you love again that they actually
have a light porcelain shade now because
this one was pretty fair and previously
la colors foundations have been orange
the lightest shades like definitely
nowhere near an actual light shade it's
nice that they have fair shade now
appreciate that so those are my top
worst foundation launches of 2017 I
always get asked what I do with
foundations that I don't like and I
actually have a whole bin I usually keep
all them it's very rare that I return
the foundation just because for videos
and everything it's useful for example a
video like this a lot of times it's
useful just a swatch I mention or
whatever I think there's about thirty in
there with the tag on the outside that
says don't like so let me know if you
guys would want me to like go through
that bin or something I don't know but
that is that if you absolutely love any
of these foundations don't be offended
it's all good it's just makeup just
foundation worst problems in the world
so if you enjoyed this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up it helps
me out and I appreciate it also just
realize and tell you guys what's on my
face the bronze I'm using is the Ashley
radiance by Catrice blush I use ciate in
too deep really pretty it's kind of like
purpley matte shades on my eyes are from
the morphe 15n palette and then the
shimmery shade on my lid which I'm in
love with is from the Tarte
foil finger paints palette that I talked
about in the new at Sephora video that
shade right there makeup revolution
goddess of love I'm in love with goddess
of love lashes are huda beauty Jade
number 13 and my lips are the new
Physicians Formula liquid lipstick
formula in very healthy I love you guys
thanks for watching see you my next
video bye bye the end of the day my by
the end of it by the end of it oh my god
this is a good tree
