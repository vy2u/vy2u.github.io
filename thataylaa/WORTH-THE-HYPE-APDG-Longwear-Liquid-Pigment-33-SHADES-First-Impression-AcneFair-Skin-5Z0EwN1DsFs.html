alright so today it is foundation Friday
this is why I try out a new foundation
every single Friday on my channel today
we're talking about a product that kind
of blew up on Instagram because of this
photo they have an amazing shade range
or just kind of what made it blow up so
this is the AP DG long-wear liquid
pigment you can buy these in three
different sizes this is the kind of
sample size which is 0.33 fluid ounces
and this retails for $18 which I feel
like is pretty pricey for only 0.33
ounces of product especially when the
next size up the full ounce is $24 on
the website says this is a long wear
liquid pigment with built in color
correctors primer and HD photo finish
ingredients all in one long wear liquid
pigment provides buildable medium
coverage that dries to a soft matte
photo finish look that's silky to the
touch
water sebum sweat and transfer resistant
you can technically use these on your
lips as well which I thought was pretty
cool as like a liquid lipstick I'm
assuming it's vegan fragrance free oil
free paraben free and cruelty free this
pigment comes in thirty-three shades I
have the two lightest shades which are
CC 0 0 and CC 0 1 I'm gonna insert
swatches right here of these two shades
compared to some of the other
foundations I own all right so swatch
time right here is the AP DG long word
liquid pigment in the lightest shade
they make CC 0 0 next over is the same
thing in CC 0 1 so it's quite a bit of a
difference between these two shades but
it kind of makes sense because this one
is pretty much like a white mixer
technically you could use it to lighten
the shade this one is still pretty dark
though for being a zero one shade x over
is the cover FX custom cover drops in
n10 dermablend flawless creator drops in
n0 Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation and
0.5 pur cosmetics paradol and porcelain
derma called 2:08 and milk makeup blur
liquid foundation and fair and I'm
filming this it's actually October 3rd
because these videos are pre recorded
since I'm currently on accutane when you
guys are seeing this so as of right now
when I'm filming this I don't see the
shade C c00 listed on their website
anymore it doesn't even have the actual
page saying sold out it's just not
listed there so I tweeted them asking
what was up with that if it's
discontinued or what's going on and they
said CC 0 0 is not discontinued and it
should be coming back up so hopefully by
the time this video goes up the shades
CC 0 0 is still on there I have my
emails at the order confirmation
shipping everything right here and
something I will say is that it took a
very long time to get here I ordered
this on August 6th I was planning on
including this in 15 days of foundation
and it didn't ship until September 18th
so it took over a month to even ship I
know that there are new small brand and
they got a ton of press and everything
about this so that's probably why but
just be aware that if you're gonna order
this it might take a long time to
actually get to you so this is an
interesting one in this video you'll
actually see me apply this a couple
different ways but here we go if you're
excited for foundation Friday don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you want to see what I think of the AP
DG long-wear liquid pigment so you're in
the right place just keep watching okay
I haven't done my hair yet so it's kind
of a hot mess right now right now it is
a 9:45
October 3rd when I'm filming this so
I've already washed moisturize and I
primed half of my face again using the
Laura Mercier foundation primer this is
the prime side right here it says that
there's a primer built into it but
because I'm assuming some people will
wear a primer and I usually do - I'm
gonna try it with the primer on half my
face I half my face I'm gonna apply it
with a brush on the other half of the
sponge just to see which one I like
better so I haven't done the swatches
for these yet but there is quite a big
shade jump between zero zero and zero
one which could be nice because this
could be more of like a mixing product
wait is this white okay this is
expecting so there's like a lipstick
applicator so this looks pretty white I
do think there's a little bit of like
cream color in there it's not pure white
but this is definitely more of like a
mixing foundation at least for me on my
skin tone so 0/1 definitely looks a bit
dark for me so I'm gonna end up mixing
these two shades so much I'm mixing
about half half there's a tiny bit less
of the white right now so our supposed
to be like pigments so I'm assuming you
need less than you would a normal
foundation
I hope let's try this shade out the zero
one shade is pretty yellow toned a
little
oranjee actually so let's start out with
the brush on this side this is the elf
ultimate blending brush feels pretty
stiff drives down pretty quick once you
put it on your face it's really matte
for some reason I was thinking it was
gonna be more dewy it also says that it
dries down a bit darker on your skin I
already used up that amount on the back
of my palette but I'm mixing some more
it says medium buildable coverage I
would say I'm using definitely a decent
amount like quite a bit of product and
I'm barely getting medium coverage feel
like you would go through this pretty
quickly and it is very liquidy a sponge
time hopefully the shade will match the
other side to get medium coverage you
really have to use a lot of products
like I already used up again that amount
that I put out but usually that amount
would cover definitely half my face
maybe a little bit more it also says
this is buildable so I do want to try
and build this up I think I'm getting
about the same coverage brush and sponge
site I'm gonna try and build this up
with a sponge kind of do like a thin
second layer mostly on my acne to see if
we can build it my lash extensions are
falling out I'm pre filming these but
you guys are gonna be seeing them over a
span of like two months so don't worry
my lashes have not been falling out for
two months by the way on their website
it does say when you do a second layer
let it dry first the first layer and
then go in for the second and my skin is
totally dry it sets down very fast
transferring transferring a tiny bit but
not bad at all what is happening over
here definitely doesn't look that great
it's doing some weird stuff so it looks
very patchy I don't know if the colors
showing up on camera I don't think it is
cuz I can't see it in the viewfinder it
looks super weird and patchy right here
it's like lighter right here and then I
have some weird patchiness like almost
where it didn't blend together ooh that
does not look good
I think the not prime side does look
better with this one especially on my
forehead I notice it on this side it
seems to be like kicking up a little bit
around my eyebrow and it just looks a
bit heavier over here it doesn't look
good yeah I'm gonna get really
okay so hopefully you guys can see this
I can't really see the viewfinder right
now around here and then let's see if
you can see the eyebrow I think you can
right here what is happening wait come
back and focus it also looks a little
weird up here it just looks like very
textured clinging weird you definitely
don't need to powder your face like it
totally sets down almost to a powder
finish which is why it's kind of
confusing that it's buildable because
since it does set down to a powder it's
almost like putting a liquid on top of a
powder at that point but it says that
it's buildable I'm definitely not liking
this right now I do have plans today so
hopefully this wears better throughout
the day
oh god my upper lip looks really bad not
good so we're gonna call the check in
time 10 o'clock I'm gonna do the rest of
my makeup and I'll be right back okay I
just want to show you guys this while
I'm in the process because hikes right
now is one word to describe all this so
I wasn't planning on setting my face
because like I said it's a total powder
finish but the more I was looking at my
face it was so uneven and like weird
coloring it's just like certain areas
are super dark so I thought maybe I
should try a powder to even it all out
so I put just on this half of my face
right now as a powder it's a large LR
balance um Brighton powder one of my
favorites and I don't even think it's
showing up on camera I hope it is my
preface by saying this powder usually
even smooth can kind of fix a lot of
foundations and just make it look more
flattering on the skin in certain areas
it is just like so weird I don't think
it's even showing up on camera in real
life you can see a line right here where
the powder is and where it's like a
little bit lighter I mean look at this
this almost reminds me what happened
with the soap and blurring foundation
but again even with the Lord Geller
powder so I could put a liquid on top of
here it did the same thing it just looks
very bad do you guys just saw what it
looked like in natural lighting on the
blog camera I would not wear this again
I probably would not go out of the house
like this I mean it's not even showing
up on camera you guys it looks it looks
very bad to the point where I think even
if you weren't into makeup you would
notice that my skin looks like
so I was kind of going back and forth on
what to do with this so I think what I'm
gonna do is take all this off and
actually try this shade as a mixing
shade so I'm going should I'm mixing it
in with another foundation since off the
bat I would not recommend wearing this
alone I definitely wouldn't wear it a
second time alone just so we can do a
full day wear test and this isn't just
like a total fail hopefully I can find a
way to make this work so I'm gonna take
all this off and I will be back for
round two okay is it clean faced I don't
think it's ever felt so good to wash my
face my eyelashes now look extra janky
so yay so I don't have primer on because
I do think the not prime side looked
better so I'm not trying to think of a
foundation to mix this with I wanted
something that was darker because this
is obviously gonna lighten it and that
actually had more coverage than this so
normally when i text mixing products
I'll try it with the covergirl clean
matte BB that with this I can tell would
just be a total disaster so much I'm
mixing it with the dermablend smooth
liquid camo I have a whole other video
on this I love this foundation I just
wish the shade worked for me this is the
lightest shade linen I also have cream
they're both way too dark and very very
yellow so let's try mixing these see
what happened can just hope that this
works better as a mixer it almost like
instantly mattifies it you can even see
on the palette it like it looks thicker
so let's try a sponge first on this side
just switch it up hopefully this works
it dries so fast so the smooth liquid
camo is very dewy moisturizing this a
hundred percent is making it look super
matte mixed in it definitely looks much
better than it did on its own it still
doesn't look good I think I'm just gonna
sponge it with this because I know I
like the sponge better getting better
coverage for sure mixing it in with the
dermablend it still looks pretty heavy
even with a sponge and mixing it in with
like a super dewy foundation that
dermablend one makes your skin super
smooth it feels really lightweight it
just looks like makeup ewwww I can see
it on my face I'm gonna see if I can
build this up just on a tiny area down
here so if it's a disaster it's okay I
don't think this is buildable I think it
totally cakes up and gets a weird
texture when you try and build it
I would not build this I think this is
like a one layer kind of thing
I don't know I still don't think I would
use this even as a mixer because I don't
think it makes my skin look good at all
dry skin I could just see this clinging
to every little thing if you have any
kind of texture acne I don't know even
on the areas where I don't like it just
doesn't look that great but I think my
face is definitely more wearable right
now so I'm gonna do the full wear test
hopefully when I put on my under-eye
concealer now it won't get all weird
blending out I'm gonna just do like a
very tiny amount of concealer and just
keep it right underneath my eyes and not
like pulling it down or anything just to
try and avoid that so right now what
time is it 10:30 so that's when we're
calling the new check-in time not gonna
powder my face with this since it has
kind of a similar effect I do think it
would just get weird with powder on top
of it again I'm applied the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back okay so
it's now 1107 my thoughts are exactly
the same so on the rest of my face I
used the Kevin and Quan tropical nights
use this shade as a contour I have on
the CYO bronzing rocks as like a blush
and then the CYO bronze and highlighting
palette this is such a beautiful
highlighter there it is I did a whole
kind of first impressions video thing on
CYO so I'll put that in the eye over
here my eyes are like a total random mix
of bronzers and contours and whatever
lips L'Oreal tongue-tied my favorite and
the CYO lip gloss in the shade your best
side second time again is 10:30 the next
check and I do will probably be in the
car because I'm gonna be out I'll see
you guys in a few hours in natural
lighting okay so it's actually 7:30
right now checking in in the middle of
the day was kind of a fail it's like the
theme this whole video I was basically
non-stop all day and when I was in a
place where I could film it was in a
parking garage and it was way too dark
and you won't have been able to see
anything so it's been on for nine hours
at this point and my face is actually
looked pretty good throughout the day
like it's definitely looked better
throughout the day the smooth liquid
camo holds up pretty great so I'm not
surprised there but I'm glad that the
other product didn't really break it
down majorly or anything so I'm gonna
zoom in but I would say after 9 hours it
looks pretty good for me I'm not getting
any major creasing or separation
obviously the center of my forehead
still doesn't look great because it
hasn't really stuck on there at the
whole day this is the AP DG
is I was gonna say ac/dc when I say apt
dude since the 8pd tree is kind of long
medium coverage and pretty heavy looking
on my skin I don't really see myself
mixing it in with a whole lot of
foundations if any just doesn't look
that great on my skin so doesn't really
make sense to you to mix it this kind of
writes me at this open glory I think I
said this earlier this open glory one
heck of a block foundation which I have
a whole video on which was also complete
fail but the way that this looked on my
skin on its own looked really similar to
that and I know some people really like
that foundation so maybe that might be a
good guide if you liked that foundation
you might like this one I mean
personally that one looked like
seeds on my skin so so did this one but
let me know what you guys think of this
foundation have you tried it this is a
smaller kind of indie brand so I don't
mean to totally on them or anything
like I always say this is just my
experience with the product you might
have a totally different one this is
just my opinion watch other videos do
your own research you might like it but
I am always going to be honest with you
guys about how something works for me
that is that if you guys enjoy this
video and you're excited for foundation
Fridays to continue don't forget to give
this a thumbs up it helps me out I love
you guys thanks for watching see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
