I haven't had a chance to like catch you
guys up but I've took some footage today
just not of me talking but we did
basically a lot of touristy things today
we saw the 9/11 memorial we went up to
the top of the one whatever it's called
thing then I got a migraine so we left

next coming months probably like two
months hopefully if everything goes as
planned so now all of the craziness with
that and beautycon and all that YouTube
stuff is over so hopefully the next few
days will be a little bit more relaxing
getting some work done right now I need
to get tomorrow's video ready to go up
this freakin cruelty free tutorial is
taking me so long to edit I think I've
been editing this for four hours now I
don't know why I had two hours of
footage it's just taking forever to go
through I have pre recorded everything
for New York but I didn't have time to
get everything edited so I'm still doing
everything while I'm here I'm gonna stop
talking because I feel like I've been
talking for like 15 minutes now but I
hope you guys are enjoying the vlog so
far if you are at any point don't forget
to thumbs it up because I've been
actually trying to vlog food has arrived
I got this salad I think this was called
the super food salad got some quinoa
avocados sweet potato kale tahini
dressing all the good stuff then I got a
green smoothie this is like their famous
smoothie apparently and then I got this
vegan peanut butter cookie B Chelsea
it is now the morning of Saturday
October 8th I got back from New York
last night super super late especially
with the jetlag it was like 4:00 a.m. my
time I'm trying to get this stupid
camera thing figured out my camera is
literally dead so I'm having to send it
back it's gonna take a week and a half
before it gets back here so kind of
stressing about how I'm gonna film these
upcoming videos
this camera I'm filming on the a 5100 is
fine it's just not the best for beauty
videos and I'll think it like totally
blurs everything and the colors are just
off like why does my wall look literally
blue right now
it is white I need to shower unpack do
my hair my hair has faded a ton the
extensions are holding the color better
because my hair is super like porous and
bleached and things so I'm just gonna
put the fancy full which is just like a
color wash over it since they only wash
my hair like once a week anyways then
I'm meeting Rach for lunch and I'm
honestly just so exhausted I'm having
the weirdest luck with like filming
stuff I went to edit one of the videos
on the plane that I pre-recorded that
was supposed to go up Monday in two days
and I totally lost half of the footage
so don't know what I'm doing with that I
don't know what video was gonna be going
up Monday that's fun technology so I'm
just gonna have like a get done day
and then hopefully relax Sunday but I
hope you guys like this video I hope I
had enough footage I haven't even looked
back at any of this yet so if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up so I
know love you guys thanks for watching
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
