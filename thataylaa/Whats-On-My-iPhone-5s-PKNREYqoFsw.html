what's on my iPhone tag I never really
got the point of these before and now
I'm like super into apps and I think
they're the funnest thing ever to watch
this is my iPhone it's the iPhone 5s or
C I don't know honestly some of the
stuff I'm saying might be wrong because
I'm not that into technology clearly I
don't know what kind of iPhone I have
but it's the new one and it's gold it is
so freakin beautiful I don't have a full
on like case on it and I do have this
gold bumper that I think I got off
Amazon or Ebay all the links will be
down below I hope my camera doesn't die
I haven't charged it let's cross our
fingers people okay so this is my
background it is a gingerbread man
trying to get in the holiday mood but it
really just makes me crave gingerbread
cookies slash all food in general okay
so this is my home page so my background
is obviously just white and gold dots
I'm like very OCD about matching my
background to my actual like phone or
whatever case I have on I don't know
it's weird um okay so let's start with
this page I have all of my basic clock
camera photos up here YouTube favorite
app ever literally lay in bed for hours
watching YouTube okay and notes music I
don't know if this is like a common
thing that is like common knowledge for
everyone that I just didn't know but
iTunes radio is freaking amazing you can
add stations that you like every morning
when I'm walking to school I listen to
the top 100 dance um I don't know they
they have annoying commercials okay
anyways it's like a cool radio thing you
can add different stations and if you're
bored of your own music then that's a
good way to go all these basic ones
Facebook Google Maps comes on your phone
Bank of America just my banking app not
going to show you that Twitter everyone
knows what Twitter is if you're not
following me on Twitter then you should
it's the same as my YouTube username
shout out to these people if you can
read that who ever liked my okay
email this is my
YouTube email so whenever I get
notifications from you guys that goes in
there
yahoo mail is my the teyla email the
best for business
you know emails okay viber I'm not going
to show you but viber is basically an
app where you can call people in other
countries for free so this is how I talk
to like my Jordanian family and friends
and ezreal and stuff viber it's a free
app um calculator I use this for my
business class because I'm too lazy to
actually bring in an actual calculator
then on my down bar or whatever you call
this thing down here I have my mail um
this is my like personal email and then
we have Google Chrome
I actually prefer group Google Chrome to
Safari I don't know why I feel like it's
faster I just like the way it looks
oh this stuff looks good Jacqueline Hill
was talking about this it's like the
beauty blender cleaner solid but she
used it to clean her brushes and I kind
of wanted to get that so I was looking
at that let me know if you've tried that
then I have phone down here next page
okay let's start off Starbucks people if
you go to Starbucks oh you got to have
the Starbucks app my card is clearly low
but it's really cool it shows you you
can load your card on here you can pay
with it so I don't even have to bring in
my wallet when I go to Starbucks it
tells you your rewards and how many like
stars you need to get a free drink I
like how my thumb is just like going in
circles woo I really know what home is
I've never checked my messages before
oh yeah sometimes there's like coupons
and stuff in here so that's cool you can
give an e gift apparently tells you the
stores it's cool
get the Starbucks app okay whatsapp
another messaging app like viber that
you can talk to people in other
countries love it actually it kind of
bothers me because what's up really
kills your battery let me know if anyone
else has that issue is kind of annoying
I always have to like do this thing and
like close it because it'll kill my
battery then I have bloggers if you have
a blog or follow a blog write a blog
whatever get the blogger app
and I have my two different blogs on
here one is one is a personal blog so
don't share it with you guys sorry and
then the other one is my the taillow
blog actually post like almost
everything I posted on my personal blog
I also post on my the Tayla blog I just
post I just like take out the locations
and personal names and all that kind of
stuff so if you go to my blog it's the
telecom it looks like this it looks
different on the computer like the fonts
and everything are different don't
really know what that is these are my
most recent blog posts got the $7 naked
palette um naked basic dupe how to ombre
dark hair DIY thrift store
transformation bla bla stuff from Israel
so go in there if you haven't already
okay snapchat
hell yeah people gotta have your
snapchat I don't want to click on it
because it tells people's last names but
I just got snapchat um literally like a
month ago and I'm addicted to Skype app
you know what Skype is cool then I have
a music folder and here I have Shazam
Shazam is that app that you can click it
and it will tell you so you say like
touch to Shazam it will listen to the
song and then it'll tell you you know
give me a nice ad and then it'll tell
you what song it is
you can look like this is the last one I
did um this was a light that never ends
or something I don't know
light that never comes Lincoln Park it
whatever it's cool because if you're
like loving a song and you don't know
what it's called you can just look it up
with Shazam then we had Pandora I think
everyone knows what pandora is a Trax I
actually prefer to Pandora it's
basically the same thing but there's
like different playlists and stuff you
can like have your saved playlist
history so then we have Google Translate
this saved my ass when I was in Jordan
with Arabic Hebrew literally this is
what I used I have been no good folder
these are just all the things that I
wish I could delete on my iPhone that I
can't like why do we have to have the
stocks app okay no like Game Center I
don't want what I don't understand why
we can't delete these just had to get
that out so then my utilities folder
this is also kind of just
that I don't really use emoji like I use
that but I don't want the app on my
desktop find my phone is really good if
you lose your iPhone you just register
and then you can like track it it
doesn't work if you're on airplane mode
though that happened to me in Israel my
phone got stolen and I couldn't track it
because it was on airplane mode but
Craigslist app is good if you just want
to post up really quick you can just go
and you can like either look at stuff or
post stuff okay blog lovin is really
cool I just found this this is an app
where it lets you like search popular
blogs or like I think you can add
certain blogs you can go to different
sections there's the beauty section and
just read like different people's blog
posts which is cool I like this because
I hate following them on the computer I
think it's a like I don't know I just
don't really know how to use it that's
why I hate it but this is cool because
it's just easy and if you're like you
know in class or something fifty shades
are read cute title anyways um probably
proof your makeup I don't know there's
stuff like cool little article street
interest
everyone loves Pinterest here's my
Pinterest I think everyone knows what
Pinterest is but that's exciting okay
this is my personal favorite folder this
is the pic editing folder I'm a pic
editing fanatic it doesn't look like I I
mean I don't have that many apps but I
use the one I use every single one of
these apps to edit a single photo I
usually start with pick stitch and this
one is good for making like the borders
and just getting like the general shape
that you want and I like this because if
you use a picture of Bentley for example
I like this because you can like do
hi-def which makes it just look better
you can just do simple things like
adjust the brightness contrast
saturation whatever and then there's
also different filters I don't like how
you can't address the levels of the
filters then you just apply it done and
then you save it so then usually after I
save the picture I will go in whoops I
will go in to pick effects pick effects
is another one of my favorites I use
this for literally every picture I feel
like it just got really dark in here
this is how I make my pictures lighter
with P FX 5 and then all usually like if
you follow my Instagram you know what
I'm talking about but then I'll usually
use like the light where are you wow
I usually will use the light Catterick
category and they have good little like
light effects this is that app where if
you're wondering what people use for the
little hearts it's this app love
this app okay moving on over
where's cool if you want to add text you
can type and then change the font to
whatever you want this is a good one if
you just need to add text to your
pictures pic beauty is cool kind of just
like blurs your imperfections if you
have like acne or something okay
seriously why did it just get super dark
in the background shopping shopping
folder I usually use these when I'm like
born in class and have nothing else to
do let's start with hot look out look
whatever everyone calls it something
different and this is basically like a
flash sale website and now they have an
app my favorite is obviously the beauty
section umm like Laura Laura Mercier
holiday sets buying that they just have
everything and they have super good
deals it's a flash sale so it's only
there for a day and then under here you
can see like the upcoming events I have
a link for hot look on my YouTube page
Lennie Bates this is my all-time
freaking favorite website Ebates is
great if you're an online shopper and
you spend way too much money online this
will help you save money basically you
type in a website and then it gives you
a certain percent cashback per website
you can see like the two times cash back
up here so which websites are not like
Target is 5% cash back and they really
do send you a check in the mail with
cashback
and also when you sign up if you spend
$25 at any of the websites you get a
free $10 gift card which is awesome I
think you can choose from like Target
and Macy's or something like that I
don't know
link for this is also under every video
on my youtube so it'll be in the YouTube
description box for this and I have the
Sephora app this is good so you don't
have to carry around your card you kind
of your Beauty Insider card in here you
can see mobile offers free shipping and
 exciting um Etsy this is another
one with favorite apps Etsy is so fun to
shop online if you have never been on it
before they have like handmade stuff and
vintage stuff super-cute jewelry
everything I actually have an Etsy store
this is the first time I'm announcing it
on the interweb I just made it a little
bit ago and I'm planning on putting
obviously a lot more stuff in it it's
called thrifty Taylor on Etsy up here if
you can see I'm really into like getting
vintage stuff and redoing it so I'm
going to be adding a lot more stuff to
here but this is what I have so far it's
a jewelry wall hanger that I made and if
you're interested you can go on my Etsy
shop and get it it's a thrift detail at
the link below in the downbar from my
Etsy shop if you want to see so and I
have Joann Fabric app they have a really
cool thing you can look at their weekly
add-on here so you can see what's on
sale and then also they just have a
coupon section which is really cool and
it tells you like what I like is a you
don't have to carry around 5000 coupons
that you forget to use and be it only
keeps the ones that are valid so I hate
when I like get to the store and I'll go
to use the coupon and it doesn't
actually work because it expired here
you won't have that issue then we have
Beauty lish I just discovered this and
holy crap it's amazing it's basically
like kind of like a combo of Instagram
and Pinterest I don't know but it's like
all beauty which is why I like it it's
really cool you can just look at all
like the makeup looks nails and
everything and see the pictures that
you've like previously liked and I like
this because when I'm getting ready for
work I need
like makeup inspiration sometimes so
I'll come on here and like do one of
these looks so that's helpful
then tinder okay we all do it don't even
try and say you don't do it everyone
goes on tinder if you don't know what
tinder is if you're over 18 I would
suggest using it actually one suggest
using it because it's extremely
addicting and yeah but it's basically
like I am gonna I don't know it's kind
of a dating app you basically just click
like like or no you can see five
pictures of the people basically if I
clicked like and this person had also
clipped like it's completely anonymous
but it will like match you together so
then once you have a match you can go
under your matches and see and now this
is what happens when you go on tinder
too much there is no one new around me
great my last two I don't have that many
apps I feel like like a lot of times
when I watch these there's like
thousands of app I don't know I just
like to keep it simple you know then I
have videos never use that vine I'm
pretty sure everyone knows the vine is
but it's like the 7 second videos or
whatever I don't know I never really
gone out I go on the website if I'm on
my computer oh I forgot Instagram this
is my other most used app I'm sure you
all know what Instagram is but if you
don't is the best app in the world um

not already
