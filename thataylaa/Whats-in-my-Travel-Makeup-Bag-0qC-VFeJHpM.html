Instagram which is the same as my
YouTube username and you guys wanted to
see a quick video before I head off for
vacation
finally how will loo yeah so
this is my travel bag like overnight
kind of bag I got it from forever 21 for
like 20 bucks I think and I love the
pattern and I love the gold like rings
on it and gold detailing I'm not gonna
show you what's in the bag because
there's just like clothes and stuff but
I am going to show you what's in my to
makeup bags holy this is heavy and
I'm not showing myself right now cuz I
look absolutely horrid I've been packing
all day and it's like 95 degrees and
you're so I guess I'll do this one first
since it's just easier they remove this
is my brush makeup bag and I got it from
court four or five four or five in our
zero dollar swap but she actually bought
this and okay this is a fail looks like
a centipede or something why am I so
normal okay so in this bag this is just
where I keep all of my brushes and my
Urban Decay all nighter spray which I
sprayed before and after my makeup I'm
not gonna go through every single brush
but I'll just show you some of them elf
kabuki brush 2 Sigma brushes that are
really dirty what's this thing called oh
my god totally blanking it Oh stippling
brush Sigma e-40 blending brush my
favorite brush on the planet Earth and
then just some random other brushes
don't think it's not entertaining so
that's what's in that little leopard guy
and I think she got this I don't know
Court comment below but I think she got
this at Target I think and then I have
my baby
I bet see evil Betsey Johnson bag and I
got this from Ross and it came with like
a baby sized one and these were both
16.99 like together and I am freaking
obsessed with it I love the skulls and
stuff and I like the like lightning bolt
zipper thing I don't know makes me feel
badass alright so in here I have all my
makeup and some random other stuff first
thing this is my jewelry and bringing
I'm only going to be gone for a week and
I'm kind of I'm gonna be doing like a
lot of Bodhi
things I'm really not gonna be like
dressing up that much so I just brought
a few pairs of forever21 earrings and
then my two bracelets that I love hoop
earrings there's a random like that
and then I have all of my makeup okay so
I'm only bringing a few pairs of lashes
just because if I want to film there
should just make you look like 50 times
better when you're filming Ardell 120s
the duo lash adhesive glue and then like
two eBay pairs which those ones are my
absolute favorite I'll put the link down
below so then all of my own on makeup
stuff just have sample packets of the
Sun Goddess and dark because I don't
want to bring like the whole bottle but
this is my absolute favorite self-tanner
ever doesn't make you look orange at all
I absolutely love it and I'm gonna be
having like a review thing on these
coming up soon you can use my username
for 10% off I'll put the code down below
the inside of this bag is really cool
I'll go anywhere with you that's nice
thanks Betsy right really there's like
25 of those anyways I'm getting
distracted okay so then I have my EOS
lip balm in sweet mint I'm just gonna go
really quickly through all these because
clearly there's a ton of okay I
guess I'll start here this is my mini Z
palette I usually have the huge
rectangle one but this one's really good
for traveling because you can just put
like your a few things that you really
want in it
I got this off eBay for like $11 I think
if I can open it with one hand and then
in here I just have my wet and wild
bronzer in Inglot eye shadow and then
like two random eyeshadows that this is
the highlight color I used under my brow
bone and then I just like those ones if
I want like a matte eye going on look at
this thing is so freakin cute this is my
all-time favorite liquid eyeliner it's
like two freaking dollars you guys at
the drugstore and it's amazing and I
don't know why my hand is shaking right
now
stop I don't know if my hand holding the
camera she can wear this hand shaking
this isn't waterproof though so I'm
bringing my maybelline ultra liner
because this is waterproof like I said
will be like in the lake and stuff I'm
trying to do this really quickly so
here's my three mascaras I'm bringing
this one is my all-time favorite this
one is a good four bottom lashes wet
where I'll make a plump and
and this one is what I put over the
voluminous and this is by Revlon I got
on clearance and I don't even think they
make it anymore which really sucks
because it's one of my favorite mascaras
ever concealer I'm bringing dermablend
cover cream upside down in rose beige
and I got this off all cosmetics
wholesale comm for like 15 bucks and
it's normally a 24 I think then lip
products I'm only bringing three I think
yeah three I have these two what are
these thank these were the maybelline
porcelains collection that were a
limited edition okay why is my hand like
seriously shaking this one is smooth
taupe and it's a nude color and then
porcelain pink and then the one lip
gloss I'm bringing is Revlon's color
burst lip gloss in Bellini it's like a
really pretty peachy nude color blushes
I'm bringing my all-time favorite elf
blush I think this was in my eye Matt's
makeup bag too and this is in peachy
keen I don't know if I said elf and
clearly I've hit pan this blush is
freaking and amazing it gives you like
the prettiest summery glow then we have
mates Sarah D no Sarah digit why does
that a J that that doesn't sound right
to me it's actually my day I need to
start saying it right so my taste Sarah
does you blush and I'm totally
butchering that name in geremy and it is
the prettiest like shimmery pink
lavender blush ever all right this is
seriously hard opening with one
hand that's the color it is so pretty
you can get this off their website I'll
put it below and then the last blush oh
just kidding then I'm bringing L'Oreal
True Match blush and innocent flush one
of my favorite blushes ever it's like a
really pretty peachy color and my
frickin neighbor highlighter and mary
lou manizer by the balm I can't open it
yeah can't open this one post a picture
on Instagram if you want to go look and
see what it looks like on okay so then
foundations I guess will do my favorite
foundation ever maybelline superstay
foundation and i have the color sand
beige and porcelain ivory whoa buddy
I'm bringing two because when I'm
wearing self-tanner I use that one and
when I
I either use that one or like mix the
two shades a new one that I've been
trying out that I actually really like
is the Neutrogena healthy skin and this
has an SPF 20 so I thought that'd be
good to bring this in the color classic
ivory the lightest shade they make cuz
I'm a pale yes I like putting over
the other two foundations I can't wear
this alone it's not enough coverage for
me but I really like the finish it goes
off it's kind of like an illuminating
foundation
I like dewy I guess and I'm bringing
obviously you guys know I'm obsessed
with the NYX jumbo pencil in milk just a
matte white jumbo pencil and then
cottage cheese it's a shiny white one
for it like good career inner tear-duct
then eyebrows I'm bringing my Maybelline
pencil defined a brow and medium brown
all right I really don't know why my
hand is shaking sorry this is the Milani
easy brow pencil and it's
water-resistant which I like and the
color is amazing I just started using
this and I really like it this is in the
shade dark brown whew my neck hurts from
looking down okay to set my foundation I
use the Maybelline fit me powder I'm in
the shade 110 porcelain I really love
this stuff obviously I love all this so
it's kind of unnecessary to say that
then for eyeshadows I'm bringing the
Naked 1 palette you guys all know what
this looks like but I'm gonna show you
anyways those are the color is just
super good everyday eyeshadows and you
can also like dress it up with the
darker shades but since those don't have
any like cool tones or anything like
that like smokey eyes and bringing the
mate makeup company or might a eyeshadow
quad and this is in fierce come on there
we go and it's basically a smoky eye
palette I have swatches on my Instagram
if you want to see they're super
pigmented it's just good if I go out or
whatever
oh I'm also bringing the Rimmel stay
matte powder because I get oily and that
helps control it and then the eye primer
I didn't realize how much my taste stuff
I had in here this is my all-time
favorite eye primer I totally replaces
my Mac's painterly paint-pot this stuff
is amazing and super creamy I would
definitely recommend this if you like
the Mac's painterly paint-pot but want
like a cheaper version
holy grail status right there then I
just have my covergirl stick concealer
in the shade neutralizer and I just use
this for under my brow bone to kind of
shape my eyebrows more and that is
everything feel like I powered through
that pretty well and I don't know why
I'm filming myself putting back in
because it's probably extremely
unentertaining but we're gonna do it
anyways whoa I just discovered that
there's little pockets in here I don't
know what the hell kind of thing would
fit in that maybe can fit like a
toothpick alright so that is everything
in my what's in my travel makeup bag if
