all right so today it is day 11 of 15
days of foundation this is where I'm
testing out a new foundation every
single day for 15 days new video goes up
every single day 6 p.m. Pacific time at
9 p.m. Eastern time if you've missed any
of days 1 through 10 those are all
linked down below in a playlist in the
description box along with everything
else you ever want to know in life so
today's product is the unique mineral
touch liquid foundation this is that
foundation that you've probably seen on
Facebook 5000 times where someone draws
a sharpie all over the face and covers
it up with this not putting Sharpie on
my face today thought about it if you
are on social media at all you've
probably seen this floating around or
been directly approached by one of the
presenters this is a direct sales
company and they sell primarily through
social media which means that there's
different representatives presenters are
called that sign up to be essentially a
salesperson for unique so they make a
commission off of every single sale kind
of like being an affiliate for a company
except these are a lot of people's
either side jobs or full-time jobs you
know obviously you're going to try and
sell as many as you can so their sales
approach has been critiqued by some
people but I think do you if you want to
be a presenter for something that you
believe in go for it as always I'm
brutally honest about products if I love
a product just tell you if I hate it
I'll also tell you just because of the
way that this product is sold I'm not
going to sugarcoat anything I'm going to
treat it just as any other foundation
that I would everyone has different
likes and dislikes and products so what
I'm saying is my opinion do your own
research watch different videos three
different reviews form your own opinions
I purchased this on my own bought this
with my own money at zero affiliation
with unique they are not sponsoring this
video I have no affiliation with any
unique presenter alright now that we
have that disclaimer up there let's jump
into the claims so I'm on uniques
website this retails for $39 you
actually only get point six eight fluid
ounces of product in here which is quite
a bit less than a standard liquid
foundation standard liquid fundation you
get about one fluid ounce of product so
this you're only getting point six eight
and it's pretty pricey thirty nine
dollars it comes in thirteen shades I
the lightest shade scarlet so let's read
about it says it's a smooth foundation
that goes on liquid and dries to a soft
powdery finish well optical diffusers
blur imperfect
and minimise wrinkles and pores no
touch-ups necessary each shade is also
available in corresponding blah blah
I liked it on here they explain all the
ingredients I don't think I've ever seen
that on a product page they actually
tell you what the ingredient is in why
they included it so that's kind of cool
I'm actually going to screenshot this
cause I feel like it is helpful so Shay
Scarlett says for very light skin with
neutral undertones the one up from that
is organza and it says for light skin
with pink undertones so I'm going to
show you guys watches right now scarlet
compared to some of the other
foundations I own alright swatch time so
right here is the unique foundation in
scarlet
next is Tarte rainforest of the sea and
fair neutral Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless 110 NARS sheer glow in Siberia
Urban Decay Naked skin in 0.5 and
L'Oreal True Match in w1 so now's the
other day why swatch against other
brands and the reason is for shade
comparison the lightest shades of
foundations are super different across
different brands so this is just a
comparison so you can see if you think
it'll work for you on their website I
don't see anything about what kind of
coverage this is supposed to be but I've
heard it's supposed to be sheared a
medium I don't actually see that on this
page so that is all the claims ons
product it has a glass bottle and a
little dropper thing right here which
you will see in the demo prior this
video if you're excited about 15 years
of foundation don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up only a few more days
left crazy if you're new here you can
join the baby toe family and subscribe
it'll notify you every single time I put
up a new video
I have tons a different foundation
playlist so if you want to see my
thoughts on the unique mineral touch
liquid foundation and how apply
somewheres throughout the day you're in
the right place just keep watching
alright so I've already washed
moisturize prime my face use my a and
table mesh matte primer like you do
every single day
I think the LA girl foundation that we
used yesterday actually broke me out by
a combination skin I usually get pretty
oily throughout the day on my t-zone
have a bunch of acne scarring and stuff
to cover up I'm going to shake this like
they say to do it says to apply it with
your fingers and then work it in with a
brush on their website but I've seen a
bunch of presenters putting it just
directly drops on to the brush it sounds
very liquidy so in the past all those
videos that you see they're typically
using a brush that looks something like
this a kabuki brush this one is by elf
and this looks way too flimsy to me
to really get me any kind of coverage or
anything so I'm not going to be using
this one they actually just released a
new brush this year that they say now is
the best for this foundation and it
looks like that bareMinerals brush has
like a little dip in the middle where
you drop the foundation into and then
you blend it out I have a few different
brushes I'm going to try here that have
different firmness and everything so
we'll just see which one works best the
first one I'm going to try is the morphe
g36 this is just a kabuki brush this is
the most firm of the three closest to
like the Sigma f80 it SEP it has a
little more bend to it
so I'm going to try this one out first
on this side of my face
I think I'm first going to try to just
put the drops directly on my foundation
brush which is what all the presenters
used to do if that doesn't work we'll go
ahead and just put it on my palate and
blend it onto my face I'm very curious
about this one okay so let's go ahead
and do one two I'm going to do folk' six
ish drops and let's go ahead whoa okay
that scent is extremely strong whoo I'm
not usually sensitive to scents but this
is like interesting blends out really
easily feels super lightweight kind of
like the Maybelline Dream liquid
foundation or the YSL fusion ink which I
use on both of those yeah Linda super
easily and quick this looks about light
coverage it covered up some of my
redness but there's still a ton of
freckles and scarring and everything
coming through so of this one layer with
this brush it looks like lake coverage
I'm just going to use two drops for my
forehead it almost feels like it feels a
little bit oilier than the way I sell
Fusion ink I'm not sure if that's going
to set but right now yeah it feels kind
of oily so on this side of my face I'm
going to try deciding between the morphe
- in the e one I think I'm going to try
this one so let's go in with the e one
and this time I'm going to put it
directly on the palette okay so this
brush just soaked up all of that I need
to know where that went
let's try that again I'm going to put
this one directly on the brush
one two three four five yeah I
definitely don't like a flimsier brush
kind of just disappearing into the brush
no go back to the g36
this isn't one of those foundations that
you can like stipple if you like you
really have to blend this in I usually
get the best coverage stippling my
foundations on but this one I think you
got a blend extremely light coverage and
it looks and feels a little bit oily it
might just be because it hasn't set into
a powder yet I'm going to see if this is
buildable I feel like the best way has
been putting it directly on this brush
hmm okay that did nothing okay this side
for the second layer I just put it on
the pallet and dipped my brush in and I
feel like we just got way better
coverage that way it looks like
straight-up grease I did shake mine
really well it feels like it's sliding
around on my face and I just want to
blend that in with my finger and it like
totally removes all that so I just put
quite a bit of product on my face and
the most I could get it to is about
medium this side looks like low medium
coverage to me there didn't cover any of
my freckles or anything I know how the
heck this covered marker because it
can't even cover a freckle right now it
is supposed to dry down to a powder
finish so we'll see but before this
totally sets into powder I'm going to do
my under eye concealer my finger just
like nicked this and if you touch it it
literally comes off okay so there is
weird stuff going on in my face it looks
like it's not really holding on at all
underneath my nose like what's going on
over here this is going to be really
hard for you guys to see it but
basically where I put the powder it
looks like two different layers right
here happen on this side - I hope you
can see this literally a line of the
powder and then the foundation so I
definitely think I am going to set the
rest of my face just so I don't have
this weird line going on it's been on
for about ten minutes now and it does
look like it's starting to get a little
bit less oily but my forehead still
looks pretty oily it does look like it
to find down here for sure I am going to
set this o because if I just touch my
finger to my face it literally totally
comes off when use my a cosmetic
celebration foundation illumination is
set so it definitely looks a lot better
now that I set my faith that in line
isn't as noticeable right now my
forehead doesn't look great it's kind of
emphasizing some dry parts in the center
of my face and I did moisturize and
everything like you normally do before
putting on foundation we're going to
call the check-in time 10:30 I'm going
to do the rest of my makeup and I'll be
right back alright so it is now 1053 the
rest of my makeup is on blush bronzer
highlight blend it out totally fine on
top something weird going on under my
eyes that my under eye concealer or
powder does not like this product
it's like clumping up really weird
underneath my eyes it might have been
putting the concealer on top of the
powder finish even that wasn't powder
finish yet my forehead doesn't look
great my forehead looks a little bit
scaly almost at this point doesn't look
horrible doesn't look great though on
the rest of my face use the Kat Von D
shade + light eye pellet on my eyes on
my cheeks all I used was Mac taupe blush
I had a little bit of blush left over on
my brush so I think it kind of added a
little bit to it and then the new la
girls strobe light strobing powder in
120 watt this is like a white highlight
frickin intense and then the bomb meet
Matt Hughes in the shade charming and
that is everything so next Jack and I do
will be in natural lighting
I will check back in in a few hours
alright so it's now 3:30 in the
afternoon so phoenicians been on for 5
hours the lighting right now it is like
dark outside I don't know what is going
on so lipstick is wearing off we can
ignore that I actually like it better
right now than when I first applied it I
think it's kind of like warming up to my
skin it looks really nice right now it
does look a little bit heavy in certain
areas like around here and my nose but
nothing horrible this side looks okay
the rest of my face looks good my
forehead looks better than when I first
applied it I think when you're just
looking at my face it looks normal and
then when I go back I don't know if you
can see this but like down here it looks
like I have like an orange line so I'm
going to go eat
it is 3:30 haven't you neaten yet and
I'm going to check back in at the end of
the night okay it is now 924 so the
Foundation's been on for 11 hours so I'm
looking pretty greasy my forehead looks
like it's separating a little bit it's
also very greasy pretty much everywhere
I normally get a little oily on my face
but especially for setting with the
powder this is pretty oily for me I do
think is oxidize a little bit throughout
the day my chest is definitely different
color than my face but it's not horrible
like it doesn't look orange or anything
I'm really wondering how these people
covered up sharpie that's like what I've
been thinking about this whole day I
have no idea because for the amount of
product I put on I probably ended up
putting on literally about at least 20
drops since I did two layers this on one
layer even on two layers is very low
coverage in my opinion for the amount of
product I had to use this thing is not
cheap
I think this would only make sense
getting if you have very dry skin and
you need light light coverage if you
want something similar to this like
similar feel an idea but that has a
little bit more coverage I would say go
with the Maybelline Dream liquid
foundation that's like under ten bucks
I'm pretty sure or the YSL one which is
obviously a high-end version of that but
the way I sell one does have a little
bit more coverage than both of those I
don't think this is horrible like
nothing looks totally out of the blue
bad it just doesn't really make sense
for me for the money I don't know even
if you do like light coverage I just
don't know if this one is worth it
keep in mind this is my personal opinion
like I said at the beginning do your own
research you might really love this but
just my two cents on it I'm not that
into this I can't really think of one
particular skin type or anything that I
would be like yes you need this in your
life I hope you guys enjoy this video if
you did make sure you give it a thumbs
up love you guys thanks for watching see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
