week's chatter and schmooze video I
asked you guys a bunch of questions that
I was going to include in a shout on
schmooze but now we're just doing a
separate Q&amp;amp;A video so it's just what
this is just going to be a chill Q&amp;amp;A
video I haven't done one of these in a
long time so here we go got my matcha
tea I'm currently addicted to grab a
snack grab some coffee this is probably
going to be a super long video I'm gonna
leave my shadow in shmooze playlist down
below and any other q and A's I've done
down below because I've gotten a lot of
repeat questions and I'm probably not
gonna feel like answered oh yeah cool
lipsticks wearing the color pop I love
sriracha ultra matte lip in mamacita and
I love the color of this but I never
usually get feathering with the ultra
matte lips but I definitely need you on
this one but I love the color so let's
just get into it I'm excited and by the
way I'm taking these from Facebook and
then there were a lot of tweets I'm
going to try and get to two but let's
just start with Facebook so there were a
lot of questions about dating
so Adrien Cooper says kind of random but
I've never really heard you mentioned
dating some serious what do you find
attractive in a potential partner
longest relationship sorry if that's too
much I'm just nosy IFL oh yeah I don't
really talk about my love life a whole
lot because this is the internet someone
else's do you only date in the Jewish
community I only ask because I find it
unbelievable that you haven't had a
boyfriend in so long
I definitely date but I haven't been in
a serious relationship in a while
even if I was I don't think I would
share it on social media for at least a
year probably there are just certain
parts of my life that I like to keep off
of the internet so don't tell you guys
every time I'm dating someone or you
know whatever but to answer Kaylee's
question no I don't only date in the
Jewish community I'm fine
dating anyone regardless of their
religion as long as we can align on
values and things that are important to
me
Adrienne's question what do you find
attractive in a potential partner I've
definitely talked about this in previous
chattering schmooze is but definitely
someone who is funny super smart
ambitious really outgoing I'm not super
outgoing and bubbly and things so I like
someone who is someone who likes to
travel someone actually tried to set me
up on snapchat the other day so thanks
for looking out you guys know any
potential men that fit this category
send them my way
Oh longest relationship my feel like
we're talking about relationships or
forever now our longest relationship was
three years Morgan Patricia says when
you move will you get a dog to my
apartment that I'm moving into you can
have dogs which I'm so excited for and
I'm pretty sure what I'm going to do is
foster dog in sign up to foster dogs
until they get adopted and a lot of the
times they're coming from kill shelters
a shelter that I've been looking into is
called gingers pet rescue in Seattle she
gets a lot of dogs from Taiwan so
probably not right when I move into my
apartment but sometime in the next year
I'm pretty sure I'm going to start to
foster dogs I'm super excited
veronique sorry from pronouncing your
name wrong says do you believe in girl
guy friendship I definitely believe in
girl guy friendship I've always been
someone who has had really close guy
friends a lot of my close friends in
high school were guys and I'm friends
with people that I used to be in
relationships with that's just the way
that I like to go about things I also
think some of the best relationships
start out as friendships so even if you
don't see potential in someone as the
boyfriend at that point you never know
Tiffani's Johansen says would you like
to have kids in the future I definitely
see myself having at least two kids
probably three not opposed to adopting
kids either Sara Green says what's the
worst date you've ever been on I would
say it was definitely a tinder date
right when I first moved to Seattle guy
wore sandals with socks that wasn't the
big issue it was just very very awkward
you know those people that just make you
more awkward that guy was one of those
people where like we should not have
been in the same room there's so much
awkward going on we went to like an art
festival together and he had to ask
specifics for like every single booth
just not my style Kailyn lien art says
places you plan to visit in the next
five years whoa that's a long time I
usually think in like two months
increments with traveling I'm pretty
spontaneous when it comes to traveling I
usually book things very last minute
just for whoever is there at the time or
whatever I'm feeling so I don't really
have a set list of places I want to
travel in the next five years but
definitely the next couple years I see
myself doing like a Spain Morocco North
Africa kind of trip I really want to go
to Lebanon Kailyn also asked will you
ever do your own makeup brand mmm
Magdalena Anna says when's the next time
you're doing another video with Papa
burrito so my parents are actually
coming to Seattle to help me move and my
dad actually called me this morning and
said just so you know I have free time
if you want to film another video so
he's all in let me know what you guys
would want to see down below we've
already done the dad tag we did dad buys
my makeup
that does my voiceovers let me know any
other videos you guys want to see with
him Brooke Renee says do you like to
read if so what's your favorite book and
author I do like to read it takes a
certain type of book to really get me
invested and into it but I love Colleen
Hoover Colleen Hoover is definitely my
favorite author right now coming out
with a new one in October but too late
is amazing November 9th I love Erin Rowe
says fear / phobias of yours to be
totally honest my biggest fear is
something happening at night when I'm by
myself
that's like my biggest fear so I
basically avoid putting myself in those
situations and I'm just extra cautious
which I feel like everyone should be
regardless but it is just horrible that
that's a conscious thought in a lot of
women's minds and Men but I feel like
not to the same degree
anyways such as got deep sharks I'm also
really great of sharks and snakes sharks
and snakes I don't with Vendela
Rose says would you ever put yourself on
The Bachelor since I know you like the
show I've joked about that before with
one of my friends but I don't know I I
can't see myself doing any kind of
reality TV show I actually went through
part of the casting process for one
reality show recently and I just changed
my mind like that's not my scene I like
being in control of editing but I can
appreciate it I love watching The
Bachelor man there's so many guide
questions okay Cheyenne Amara says not
that's a really pretty name by the way
not makeup related but have you ever
thought about living in a different
country for a period of time if so where
I always forget that a lot of people are
new and don't know my whole past few
years I lived in the Middle East in
Jordan for a year also lived in Israel
yeah I a hundred percent 111 a different
country for a period of time so
interesting because what I'm doing right
now is technically mobile like I could
do it in a different country the only
thing is with YouTube with new releases
drugstore makeup all that stuff I feel
like it would actually really affect my
content so I think it would be a little
bit tricky but I would definitely do it
for a few months maybe even have like a
month worth of videos pre-recorded and
then just film a couple months while in
there but if YouTube wasn't something
I'm doing I definitely feel like I
already would have been living a
different country at this point Martha
says what was your least favorite job I
feel like those always have some crazy
stories my Lisa a job was working in a
dental office I think some of the ladies
in the office watched my videos so I
love you guys the only part of that I
didn't like was the actual work I was
doing it was so monotonous it was so
boring they
literally converting physical dental
charts into online charts so it was like
ten steps over and over and over again
for thousands of patients I remember
vividly looking at the clock and
thinking like 45 minutes went by and it
literally be about eight minutes and
that is when I told myself I never want
to have a job where I look at the clock
like that when Lou says tell us about
your migraines I know you don't like to
talk about your health but it could help
the rest of us here who deal with
chronic pain the travel blogs you can
see that it takes his toll but she just
keeps on rolling when I work slash
travel I have to budget for the bad days
i 100% budget for the bad days that's
why I do things so far in advance and
have such a planned schedule I give
myself at least two days of leeway for
pretty much everything I do so that if I
am feeling crappy that day hopefully I
have two days to make it up and get it
done I can talk about it here there's
just too much information but I think I
eventually will make a video on it I
just want to have some kind of not here
but I want to have some kind of relief
so that I can share with you guys what
actually helped I want there to be a
positive spin on it
so that people can see the light at the
end of the tunnel so as soon as I find
that I'll let you guys know tell Z we'll
decide when you have a day that you feel
lazy AF how do you motivate yourself
being someone who I work at home I
definitely have to motivate myself I
don't think you can do those things if
you're not self-motivated but I
definitely still have lazy days and I
think for me I just kind of roll with it
like if I have the day where I
absolutely can't get in the zone
I don't feel motivated I'll either go
take a break for a couple hours I'm
literally not getting anything done and
just staring at the computer screen for
me it's like I could have just spent
that hour staring at the computer screen
and actually gone on a walk or gone on a
drive or whatever it is and just taking
that hour off and come back more
re-energized so I feel like just knowing
when to step away or I just drink coffee
and get reenergize that's usually my
go-to actually think for me my biggest
motivation sometimes putting on music I
work way faster and get way more into it
when I'm listening to like good pump up
music so if I am NOT in the zone and I'm
feeling super lazy just put on some
really good like for me Eminem gets me
going
sandesh says how long did it take you to
achieve the level of followers that you
have now literal I mean five years
however long I've been on YouTube now
the date that it says on YouTube when I
started my channel is totally off
because I created the channel before I
start
uploading something I've been actively
making videos for yeah five years
doesn't happen overnight folks police
done against has what extracurriculars
were you involved in in high school
slash college high school I did
gymnastics and tennis I did ASB
at some point when was it she also says
what's the best and worst YouTube
comments you've gone I have a folder of
really nasty YouTube comments that I'm
saving for a future video at some point
it is disturbing makes me really sad for
kids in middle school in high school
growing up with social media and
thinking that it's normal to say things
like this or read things like this but I
also have a folder for the good comments
so when I'm having a bad YouTube day I
like to read through some of the good
comments and just know that when you
guys leave those kind of comments it
definitely affects me in a good way
without those comments I think it would
be a lot harder to read the bad comments
so you just get to a certain point where
you you read comments every day for
years so you get to a point where it
doesn't affect you as much but the good
comments definitely stand out to me more
than the bad comments with bad comments
I usually just delete and move on dr.
Hernandez says what's your favorite TV
show I think shameless actually
shameless has moved up to the top of my
list this year
I love shameless I love sci-fi stuff
anything like Westworld sense8 I mean
the classics Prison Break Grey's Anatomy
Veronica Calado says how do you take
your coffee black Melissa says have you
been doing something different for your
skin it's looking very clear these days
I switch my face wash but honestly my
skin has not been clear the past couple
months my skin's actually been pretty
bad I know I have some huge breakouts
all over the lights blur everything so
so it's probably why my skin looks
clearer than it is but no big changes in
the skin department Oh someone actually
asked if I like snakes that's a big no
Tamra Jane Fox says any motivational
tips about starting on YouTube this is
one of my most asked questions like a
bowl time yeah you just have to start
you really do people make excuses for
5,000 reasons why they can't do
something literally all you need now
especially is an iPhone you don't even
need a camera a big window some natural
light and your voice that's all you need
most computers come with free editing
software whether it's Windows Movie
Maker iMovie don't need any kind of
fancy equipment you don't need any kind
of
as long as your videos are visually
appealing enough to watch meaning or not
in like a dark a seroma no one can see
your face or hear you and you're just
being yourself there are no reasons why
you can't at least try everyone feels
silly at the beginning because you're
literally talking to yourself almost
every single person on YouTube unless
you like came from Instagram and then
transferred your audience over to
YouTube every person has gone through
the phase where no one's watching your
videos you feel ridiculous you don't
want to tell people in real life because
you're embarrassed you don't know what
you're talking about you don't know what
you're doing you are the only thing
stopping you from making videos every
person has gone through that I think
that's honestly one of the coolest parts
about being a youtuber is that when you
meet other youtubers you know that
everyone has pushed through for years
and everyone's gone through that kind of
stuff and they just kept doing it which
is not an easy thing to do you
absolutely love doing it instead of
getting caught up on what other people
are doing or how many subscribers
so-and-so is that or whatever you're
doing it because you love doing it and
at the end of the day that's really what
you need to keep doing it for years
and it will probably take you years and
if you don't love doing it then this is
probably isn't the thing for you because
not typically something that you see
quick roast with moral of the story stop
making excuses why don't have time money
whatever it is and just do it because
pretty much no one had any of those
things when I started out on YouTube so
all those just came for Facebook so I
think in the next shadow inch moves I'll
pull some of the tweets that you guys
sent but I don't even know how long I
just talked for but I feel like it was a
long time so I'm going to cut this one
off here I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I show a lot more of my life on
snapchat that's where I post most often
so if you're not following me on
snapchat it's just the tail of snap not
the tail
that is not me and I'll hook that name
thank you I'm also on Instagram Facebook
Twitter because you guys enjoy this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
thank you all of you who sent in
questions I appreciate it I love you
guys thanks for watching
see you my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
