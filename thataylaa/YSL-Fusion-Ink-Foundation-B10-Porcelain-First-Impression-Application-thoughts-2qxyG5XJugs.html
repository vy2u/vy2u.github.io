the brand new YSL fusion ink foundation
this is supposed to be a super
lightweight but medium to full coverage
foundation this retails for $60 at
Sephora which is freaking pricey I mean
it looks classy I don't know if it's $60
worth of classy I'm obsessed with my
Maybelline Dream wonder liquid
foundation and this sounded pretty
similar to it so I wanted to see how
they compare I will link the video over
here where I talk about Maybelline Dream
wonder so looking at the YSL website is
supposed to wear for 24 hours which I
don't know why you would have your
foundation on for 24 hours this comes in
21 shades which is pretty incredible I'm
in the shade b10 porcelain and clearly
it is light enough I actually really
like the shade of this and I think the
lightest shade is lighter than the
Maybelline foundation so that's a plus
it says that is supposed to feel like a
feather and we're lightening very poetic
of ey so soft matte finish which I agree
with doesn't look very matte on my
forehead but the rest of my face looks
pretty mad it also has SPF 18 downside
of this foundation is that it doesn't
have a pump it does have this weird
applicator thing which is similar to the
Maybelline one I am NOT a fan of the
applicator at all feel like if you're
buying a $60 foundation it should
definitely have a pump Packaging is
obviously gorgeous so if you want to see
how this foundation applies and you want
to hear my thoughts on it just keep
watching
all right I literally just figured out
how to work the camera I've had for like
a year and a half I managed to change
the brightness hallelujah all right so
I've already primed my face with benefit
Porefessional where is it this is what I
use every single day I love this primer
I think I'm just going to keep this box
so I got the shade b10 obviously that's
the lightest shade this is so pretty
this is what the bottle looks like
there's this pull off gold cap card
unscrews not a huge fan of this
applicator you can either directly apply
it on your face which isn't very
sanitary because you're putting all of
your face bacteria back in the bottle
since I have super acne prone skin I
like to avoid that so I think I'm just
going to pour a little bit of this on
the back of my hand
I'm just using that dropper to apply it
to the back of my hand which is clean
says to apply with your fingers but I'm
not really down for that so I think
we're going to use a foundation brush I
use my Sigma f80 to apply the Maybelline
Dream wonder so I'm thinking this should
do the same
so I'm stippling it oh it smells so good
smells like a mixture of roses and
rubbing alcohol let's just go ahead
all right first thoughts it feels very
very similar to the Maybelline Dream
wonder going on feels like you're
literally not rubbing anything on your
face at all that did a pretty good job I
think this does have a little bit more
coverage than the Maybelline Dream
wonder still see a little bit of my acne
scarring and redness and stuff peeking
through which usually happens with
maybelline step 2 then I'm going to go
ahead and do a second layer afterwards
definitely feels like you're not
applying anything for your face and it
has a pretty much powder finish feels
like you're petting a baby's butt
heading home contouring firm
I'm gonna go ahead and do the rest of my
face and then we will do a second layer
and see how this covers
you
all right here's one layer of the
foundation I think the color is pretty
spot-on so far it looks pretty much
exactly like the Maybelline foundation
so I'm just going to go in with half the
amount that we use the first time and
see if this is buildable I don't know
how much of a difference that made I
think it covered a little bit more but
it looks pretty similar to the left side
of my face I am getting a little bit of
brushstrokes on my forehead so I'm going
to go ahead and use my finger and just
see if I can even that out without it
rubbing off here's two layers of the Y
self foundation I do think it gives a
little bit more coverage than Maybelline
not noticing any huge differences
between them right now to be honest so
far looking good I'm going to apply the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
alright so the rest of my makeup is on I
do like the way it looks I don't think
it looks as natural as a Maybelline
foundation I'm curious to see if it
would look different if I use my fingers
to apply it I do have a shadow news
video and look I'm wearing right now so
if you want to see how I did my eyes and
lips and face brush my face then you can
click right here and you can go watch
that video a little bit new window so I
will be checking back every few hours to
see how this foundation wears throughout
the day is now 12:30 p.m. I applied this
about an hour ago since I did just film
the other video so I'll check back
around probably 3 ish
all right so it is now 3:30 in the
afternoon this is a frickin workout
holding this camera foundation looks
good um little acne showing through
right here and it's not food or actually
yeah that guy is showing through it's
definitely some creasing around the
mouth area which I usually get with
thicker foundations but I didn't think
it would happen with this one I look a
little shiny but when you when I
actually touch my skin it's definitely
not oily there's a huge bug on our
window right now something that I forgot
to mention before when you touch your
face
this doesn't transfer at all which is
very rare for me so I really like that
it is one of those foundations where I
feel like I'm breaking out right now I
don't know what it is with certain
foundations I feel like I can feel my
skin not liking it you know what I mean
but as far as the looks of it goes it
looks good
so I will check back in a few hours my
arm is about to fall off right now
right so it is now 9:30 p.m. at night
I've been painting furniture for like
three hours
hence the white all over my hands I
think the foundation looks really great
my forehead does look a little bit shiny
once I rubbed my finger over the mouth
lines they disappeared feel like my acne
is kind of showing through a little bit
but nothing too horrible I think this
definitely looks better after nine hours
than the Maybelline Dream wonder
foundation but other than that I think
there are pretty much dupes for each
other except the Maybelline one is about
fifty five dollars cheaper honestly I
don't know if I'll be keeping this
foundation just because I feel like the
Maybelline one is so similar I don't
know if $60 is worth it to me however if
you don't mind the price tag I think it
is a great foundation looks great the
color hasn't oxidized at all which I
really like if you like first
impressions videos and this is helpful
for you be sure to give this a thumbs up
so I know my arm is shaking right now
holding this camera comment down below
