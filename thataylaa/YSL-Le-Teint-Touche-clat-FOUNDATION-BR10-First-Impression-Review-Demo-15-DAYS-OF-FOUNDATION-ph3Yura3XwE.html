of foundation where is time going pretty
much halfway through if you're new here
15 days of foundation is where we are
trying out a new foundation every single
day for 15 days if you missed any of the
previous six days you can watch them all
down below it's linked in a playlist but
today we are trying out a super hyped up
foundation this is the wild to ship lot
probably not saying that to ship La Push
o'clock radiance awakening foundation I
will be having a drugstore foundation
coming tomorrow so this is a little bit
out of your price point I feel yeah I
actually got this guy off of glambot
which is one of my favorite sites I've
mentioned it multiple times on my
channel I love to I bought you can
basically buy and sell pre-owned makeup
for super cheap what I do is sign up for
their email newsletters that way you get
notified first every time you sale goes
up getting those email alerts are the
way to go because then you know as soon
as there's like an 80 percent off sale
or 40 percent off whatever it is and you
can get some really freaking good deals
on there so if you're not someone who
likes spending a on makeup glambot
is where you can try some high-end stuff
or super cheap they have a ton of
limited edition makeup on there too
which is awesome if you're like one of
those people who collect that stuff
so here's thank you to glambot for
collaborating with me on this video and
supporting 15 days of foundation and my
channel they were cool enough to give
you guys that 30% off code so I'm gonna
listen and the description box down
below it's good for three days I think
72 hours yeah I love working with them
they're awesome oh we should probably
talk about the hair hair change I didn't
think this was going to happen during
this series but it did Grayling's is a
hair reveal right now I love it I'm
super happy with it this isn't the end
result I'm still going to silver so
basically going to be belly ojung it
slowly until I get it to that color
safely health healthily but I love it I
told her I wanted all the warm comes out
so I feel good I like the cool tones and
as some people aren't gonna like it but
it's my head's my hair okay let's get
into the foundation shall we
so I'm looking on YSL's website to read
some of the claims this foundation
retails for $58 you can get it on
Nordstrom Sephora the usual the first
line of the description of this as 8
hours of beauty sleep
and a drop send me up it doesn't
actually say a whole lot about what this
foundation is supposed to do says give
flawless coverage has ruscus extract
anti fatigue formula that energizes the
skin by stimulating micro circulation
and targeting dullness to instantly
improve skin brightness and luminosity
has a weightless feel it's not a whole
lot says it has eight hours of fresh
naturally radiant finish so this is
supposed to only last for eight hours
apparently which is interesting I've
never had a foundation actually say that
typically you only want to list that if
it has good lasting power but we'll see
it says that you're supposed to apply it
with their white brush I've not really
about that life I don't really like
purchasing the foundation brushes that
come with foundations like I said in a
previous video I think you should be
able to apply foundation with the tools
that you have and have it still look
good so it's pretty much all of the
claims on here it does come in 22 shades
which Rox
I have to show you to be are 10 B D 10
says warm porcelain and VR 10 is cool
porcelain I'm going to search some
swatch comparisons right now because you
guys seem to like that thank you thank
you for the feedback duly noted so I'll
show you some swatches you guys can see
how it compares to some of my other
foundations so right here's the YSL
foundation this is Marc Jacobs
remarkable in the shade 10 Maybelline
fit me 110 matte and poreless this is
the Tarte foundation rainforest of the
sea which we did on day three Mac and W
10 and this is Estee Lauder Double Wear
and one C one bonus points for
remembering all those if you guys like
this video and are excited about 15 days
of foundation make sure you give this
video a thumbs up there's a series with
your friends if you're loving it don't
forget to check out glambot down below
if you guys want to see how this
foundation applies and where's
throughout the day you're in the right
place just keep watching
6:49 in the morning right now usually
wash my face and stuff before I get
coffee but today it was a coffee first
kind of day my roommate is obviously
asleep right now some an attempt to be
semi quiet hopefully you guys can hear
me okay so I'm going to pry them half of
my face
today I'm using the Make Up For Ever
step one smoothing primer I'm gonna use
it on the right side of my face already
applied my it's just a don't moisturize
err and wash the face this stuff just
smells like spot to me so freaking
excited to try this this is just like
beautiful I love wise Elle's packaging
so this does have a pump so I'm just
going to pump a little bit on the back
when palette not sure how full coverage
this is so see looks kind of a little
bit run here than I was expecting then
we're going to use the brush yeah I'm
use a brush when I said my face and the
pure cosmetic sponge on the other side
of my face we're going to start by daven
some mom smells like YSL foundation the
smells exactly like their fusion ink
foundation and I do have a full review
on the fusion ink foundation it's like
an older one back me other apartment
days whoo I love this shade the same be
our 10th raid in the fusion ink and I
feel like something about it it's just
super flattering blending out super
easily and definitely has way better
coverage than I was expecting I really
like how it's applying with the brush
and I'm a dab some on the forehead this
is my first day applying makeup with
this hair so I'm super excited to see
how like lip colors and stuff work out
the warm hair I just like could not do I
know a lot of you guys like together
hair and thank you for all the comments
super nice but I just can't do it
literally no complaints how that applied
it applied it beautifully looks like a
nice satin finish not to doing it was
kind of expecting it to be doing here so
far I like the shade a lot and coverage
wise looks like I got high medium to
full with the brush so let's see how
much the sponge covers up on the side I
did use almost all that so I'm gonna
have to pump out
more is one of my favorites one just
going to have a flat edge and there's
something about it that's I like so that
blended us super quickly that probably
took about 15 seconds it looks really
nice coverage wise I do like the
coverage better on the brush side but if
you're not someone who needs totally
full coverage sponge definitely looks
nice which I do feel like especially in
my forehead that's sitting a little bit
better on the prime side actually I'm
gonna go in with about half a pump and
the brush and just add a little bit more
coverage to this end in case so that was
super quick easy to get the coverage I
like I love the finish
sitting totally fine on both sides but I
do feel like your leg this side a little
bit better looks pretty good on my
forehead I'm going to go over it with a
sponge a little bit just to make it look
flawless yeah that still sticky so it
doesn't stat super fast so I'm going to
show you guys a close-up and then apply
there are some eye makeup not sure if I
will be setting it with a powder it
doesn't fully set I'll probably just set
this area of my face with a powder just
I can blend my blush and bronzer and
everything on there do it
okay this happened like a year ago in
this apartment and we still can't figure
out what it is okay so here's a close-up
it just looks so smooth really like how
it's sitting on the skin forehead looks
good okay so it's now 735 the rest of my
makeup is on so my makeup pretty much
was almost all drugstore don't you love
it when all things on your face together
are less than your foundation I feel
like that's a trying new products is all
about knowing where to splurge and where
to save that could be video so super
quick on my lips is Maybelline gone
greige 760 with a little bit of this wet
mild lipgloss this is their new one in
Jack
yellow mode I wanted to tell you guys
about the blush and highlight because
I've been pretty much wearing this combo
in every single video during this series
and I'm obsessed with it this is a wet
and wild color I caught ombre blush in
in a purple haze love this it blends out
so beautifully and then this is my Holy
Grail Physicians Formula shimmer strip
except this is in a different shade then
I usually use this is in natural nude I
usually use warm nude I believe and
these shades if you have fair scandi
shades as a highlight or just like
stunning so as far as how everything
applied on top I didn't apply a setting
powder to the center of my face or
anything I only put a little bit of the
coverfx illuminating setting powder on
my cheek area so I could blend my cheek
products on it looks really nice I do
feel like it darkened a little bit so
I'm hoping it doesn't oxidize any more
throughout the day really like in the
finish and way it's sitting on my skin
no complaints right now I think it 734
or something whatever 730 Liz called
7:30 I have a phone meeting in a little
bit which is why I woke up so early to
do this and I'm just going to be working
so I'll check back in a few hours
look at that highlight alright there's
nothing to lean that camera on right now
but I wanted to do this check-in in
natural lighting just so you guys can
see how it looks there we go so it's now
12 24 so the Foundation's been on for
almost 5 hours so far so good I am
getting a little bit of creasing around
my nose area upper lip looks totally
good thrusts my face looks good enough
says I just use the same mask like 3
days in a row but I do feel like my skin
looks drier than usual which you're not
really used to like my forehead just
looks a little bit dry next time I wear
this I'm going to try it with a
moisturizing primer and just make sure
to moisturize really well before
applying this but so far I like it I
think it looks really nice I like the
shade of it I totally forgot that I have
an appointment today at 2:30 to get
my clip-in extensions cut in colored to
match this hair and going to a
difference lon I went to for this
because dye Braille doesn't cut and
color extensions ok had an interesting
second half of the day so it is now
7-eleven first we will talk about the
makeup then I will explain what happened
um okay so makeup 7:10 p.m. so it's been
on for woah 12 hours it's definitely
broken down around my nose area totally
wore off on my forehead
it looks pretty shiny we're off on my
chin area right here this my cheeks look
pretty good prime versus not prime side
looks pretty much the same this area
looks really good so this gives me hope
because this is where I said it
this foundation didn't claim to be long
wearing foundation actually at about the
eight hour mark is when I left to go to
the salon and it looked good then so I
do think that as far as the eight hour
claim it held up for eight hours I'm
definitely going to give this one
another go I'll update you guys on
snapchat in the last video the series
and we'll be rating all the foundations
one to fifteen and kind of giving you my
updated thoughts as I like try them in
between some of the days this one I will
definitely try another time with a
powder to set it I always update you
guys for some snapchat so the tale of
snaps you can follow me there never
claim to hold up for 12 hours so can't
really give it there looks pretty
good at the eight hour point and
probably should have filmed but it looks
pretty much exactly the same as the five
hour point Cara Lee say if I totally
loved it at this point I definitely feel
like the fact that it went on so easily
and blended out so easily does give me
hope that with the right primer and
powder I could like this not going to be
recommending this quite yet just because
I don't know how totally it's going to
work I definitely don't think it's a bad
product it went on beautifully yeah kind
of on the fence about it right now
we shall try try different ways onto the
hair drama of the day feel like I've
been in a freaking salon for like half
my life at this point so I'm going to be
doing a whole a hair update video on the
second half of this process but I post
on Instagram the salon I went to and
kind of my thoughts and she did amazing
she was incredible
she's the one who did this color and got
it super Ashley like I wanted she
doesn't cut in color extension so I had
to find someone else to do that part of
it brought in my Bombay extension told
her that I wanted them to match my hair
color obviously like that's the goal
with extensions right make it blend and
they turned out this color I actually
like this color if the rest of my head
was this color I'm a certain picture
right here this is just too good but in
natural lighting this is the difference
it is literally two entirely different
colors I couldn't even tell the degree
to which there were different colors in
the salon with their lighting as soon as
I got in the uber and I got home I was
like shocked
um I paid $250 to have her cut and color
these extensions you guys are in see
this few days after happen because these
are pre-recorded a couple days in
advance but if you follow me on snapchat
you saw all of us go down thank you to
everyone who is snapping me giving me
advice what to do with extensions not
the end of the world but when you pay
that much for something and literally
have something that you can't wear
outside it's a little bit of a bummer
but anyways yes so I'm going to go wash
these I still have to pack for San Diego
I leave at 4 in the morning
tomorrow's video is going to be a
drugstore foundation so if you're
excited and you like this video give it
a thumbs up love you guys thanks for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
