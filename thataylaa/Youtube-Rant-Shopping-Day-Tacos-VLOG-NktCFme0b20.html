was watching old blogs last night
leopard rope vlogs comment down below if
your friend leopard roadblock days and I
just felt like vlogging they're fun to
watch I love watching other people's
blogs hope mine are interesting enough
for people to like Joe much and I just
felt like vlogging today going to run
some errands right now I'm actually
returning the dress that I got for
Kendall's wedding that I didn't end up
wearing using my phone right now because
I never actually without my vlog camera
when I'm like in stores and but for
some reason the phone feels easier let
me show you the dress so this is the
dress that I ordered online but didn't
end up wearing it is what green is this
Vince Camuto is freakin pricey so I'm
going to return it right now it's super
cute it's just a little bit long in the
materials like kind of thick in a way
which I don't really like I recently got
a new wallet I've never done a what's in
my bag video kind of want to do one this
is my new wallet Marc Jacobs I got on
hot look for a really good price okay
the Seattle weather has been bizarre
lately it was literally eighty degrees
yesterday and today it's like 60 got 65
and cloudy
it's Friday before 4th of July this
video didn't think my car was mark I've
basically been doing a ton of pre
recording for 15 days of foundation I've
been doing a first impression video like
every single day between other work I've
been busy
right now I'm wearing the Kylie lip kit
in 22 for the first time and it feels
super drying I do really like the color
it's like super matte but it does feel
pretty drying I don't know I've mixed
thoughts on the Kylie lip kits I should
probably drive but anyways today is
Friday I feel like I've said that four
times now I woke up super early to get
some work done I woke up with a migraine
I've woke up or gone to sleep with a
migraine every single day for the last
five days so that's been kind of hell
thank God for imitrex that's what I take
when I get a migraine and it usually
knock on wood gets rid of it in like a
couple hours sometimes it feels super
drowsy and like can't function the rest
of the day but today I feel okay I'm
hoping it doesn't come back I still like
feel it in my neck a little bit but
you just got to keep going here we go
blog I legit just got in my car like two
minutes ago and I already have to pee
does anyone else do that somebody's
Seattle streets man so weird like they
just don't put stop signs at a four-way
intersection so you just kind of have to
go and hope you don't get hit that's my
strategy anyways I had to stop into
Panera to use their bathroom so I was
about to pee in my pants so about an
iced chai latte and it's not bad I
almost think it might be better than
Starbucks is chai tea it's not as like
spicy definitely is syrup but not bad
not bad
okay so I did some damage but I have a
few gift cards I didn't actually do that
much damage let's see if this works
oh there we go in the Jeep there's
nowhere to like stick the photo that
actually looks pretty good so I was
really bad and went to jack-in-the-box
because I'm freaking starving guys ever
wanted taco sauce and I said yeah look
at how many freakin packets of hot sauce
he gave me like this is redic there's
literally ten more in here to curly
fries oh man I'm super excited because I
found a purse that's my small like
crossbody that I use when I don't have
my laptop to carry or anything but when
I go work I have my laptop in my purse
so I need a bag that's like tall enough
to fit my laptop but that doesn't look
super big I'm pretty tiny so purses
usually look like huge on me it's really
hard to find the purse that actually
fits well okay I think everything is out
of this chocolate right now the heck man
oh no what is going on me and Olaf are
gonna be wearing this taco in about two
seconds anyway so I found a purse from
papaya it was only like 22 bucks and it
looks pretty nice like the material and
stuff feel like I kind of overworked
Monday through Thursday this week so it
feels nice is just like chill kind of
today that's what super nice about being
your own boss no I'm doing my freelance
stuff it's so nice to just make my own
schedule if I want to I can work 13
hours in one day and then like sleep in
the next day it's just super nice we
definitely have to be super self
motivated though if you're someone who
needs that push to like get stuff done
then probably wouldn't work out too well
I have like way more social energy now
before I would come home and like
literally not want to leave the house on
the weekend because I would be filming
editing uploading and now I feel like I
actually have energy to like hang out
with friends and do stuff on the weekend
which is super nice what are you guys
doing some people really hate when
people eat in videos though sorry if
this bothers you it's a vlog it's weird
how you can't just get one talk about
jack-in-the-box
I think one of my first vlogs ever was a
curly fry vlog oh I wanted to talk to
you guys about my like uploading lately
because I'm working 25 hours consulting
the rest on YouTube I've a lot more time
than I did before to do YouTube and can
I just say I really don't understand how
full-time youtubers upload one video a
week to I can get but what the are
you doing what the rest of your time
like there are events there are products
you're working on
there's merch but like I'm doing that
and I know other youtubers who are doing
that too I don't know it just blows my
mind like a lot of youtubers have
excuses and the way I look at it like
this is your job and the way you
approach YouTube should be the way you
would approach a job in real life have
integrity have work ethic I've actually
been pretty annoyed with the YouTube
community lately I'm going to be making
a rant soon on FTC and sponsorships and
if follow me on twitter you saw a full
rant about this the other day but
there's just been so much dishonesty
going on from like big youtubers and
people trust them they claim that
they're being honest and they're not and
it just sucks for the smaller youtubers
who actually put in so much effort who
try so hard and put out so much content
and are honest and then there's huge
youtubers who put out one video every
two weeks aren't honest don't say when a
video is sponsored and they just get
away with it of course there are people
like that in the real world as well
I don't know personally I would rather
fall asleep at night feeling good about
myself and knowing that I'm not lying to
hundreds of thousands people but yeah
anyways alright I'm gonna finish eating
and I'll do a haul when I get home
at least when you're sitting in traffic
in Seattle you have a year of the Space
Needle there was legit just a huge-ass
bright green bug this big on my arm oh I
can't there it is get out of here bro
you what the heck is that thing
okay I just got home there's not really
anywhere to set this thing where there's
decent lighting I need to get one of
those claw things or they call it okay
okay so I got stuff from papaya which if
you don't have it it's like a cheap
version of forever 21 it's like what
forever 21 used to be it went there old
Davy in forever 21 here's the first type
I gotta show you guys trying on some of
this stuff but I just love palm print
I'm super into palm and I love these
colors I'm just like picturing
everything with my silver hair because
if you like everything with blonde or
silver hair will look so much better
than like red hair so keep in mind
that's the vision then I got this sports
bra I definitely did not need a new
sports bra but it was a neon pink and
check out this back this back is legit
super strap is super cute but here's the
purse I found out papaya and I'm super
excited about this this is just super
basic black looks kind of crap on this
iPhone but the weather actually looks
pretty nice in real life I love the long
straps because I hate having my laptop
like up in my armpit and this has
magnetic button closure okay I just got
a couple boring things a little maybe I
got pajama pants these are actually from
the girls section a lot of times you can
find the same exact stuff in the kid
size just like way cheaper so these were
794 and they're super soft and I just
needed a new sleeping shorts and I got
workout pants there yo guys I have these
in the dark gray print already so I
picked up the light gray ones
Old Navy yoga pants are really hit or
miss for me sometimes they're super
cheap and have like holes in them or
like rip super easy but my other great
ones I've had for public a year and a
half now then I got super exciting socks
no show liners this is for when I wear
the ankle
and stuff that I mentioned forever 21
and basically needed more filming tops
which sounds weird but hops to wear
while you're filming are actually kind
of hard because usually when I see like
here up so it either looks like you're
naked or there's not a whole lot of area
to look cute you know what I'm saying so
I wanted to get a couple like high neck
things so got this which is basically
how I feel about the internet right now
then I got this crop top kind of thing I
like this cuz it's bad here but it's
still product at the back down it's bad
here but it's still like a crop top you
know I'm saying and I like the little
nodding detail right there I love this
top I feel like this looked really cute
on and I feel like it has this cross
detail high enough where you'll be able
to see it on camera hopefully what am i
trying to do right now okay there's the
crosses fail and then the last thing I
got at forever 21 and I had a ton of
return credit cards or whatever from 21
actually hate shopping there period I
think the return policy is absolutely
ridiculous probably not gonna be
shopping there anymore after I use up
all my return cards but basically if you
order online you're screwed you can't
get money back on your card they just
have a really shitty return policy in my
opinion stores never really organized I
don't know I just like I'm not that
thrilled with them but anyways I got
this dress which is like off the
shoulder kind of thing but on a cruise
in August so kind of wanted to get
something for that so that was
everything that I got I'm probably gonna
end this here because I'm starting to
feel crappy again and I'm gonna do some
work right now hopefully I can get some
done before them full on my greening if
you guys like this video and you want
more vlogs give it a thumbs up so I know
I'm gonna leave all the links to
previous vlogs down below I love you
