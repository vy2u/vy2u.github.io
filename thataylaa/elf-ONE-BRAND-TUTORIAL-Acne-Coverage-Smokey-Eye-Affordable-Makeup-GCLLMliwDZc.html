Michaels doing a smoky eye
good day all right so today we have a
shadowing schmooze style tutorial on the
look I'm wearing right now this is all /
99.9% elf products on my face so super
affordable help has some really awesome
products and especially in the last two
years I feel like they've majorly
stepped it up with like their skin care
line just everything I've been using elf
literally for probably almost 10 years
since I was like a teenager some of
their products I use on a daily weekly
basis and some of these were brand new
to me and I feel like I found some gems
and I'm excited to share them with you
guys so I hope you guys like this look
you can wear it pretty much wherever you
want to wear a smoky eye to whatever
floats your boat this hair is literally
like coming out in chunks so if you want
to see how I got this look you're in the
right place just keep watching
alright have my giant box of elf stuff
I've already had three cups of coffee
today and I literally feel like I've had
zero super excited to try this because
this has literally been sitting in my
drawer all this stuff has been sitting
my drawer for like six months probably I
was planning on filming this video a
long time ago I don't know what happened
but we are here today right now so I
feel like the week looks kind of weird
when I don't like clip it back so this
is the moisturizing foundation stick so
I have the shade ivory I still have a
tiny tiny tiny bit of fake tan on from
when I went on vacation I just want it
gone you know I'm saying
so this shade will hopefully match me
right now I'm not having never open this
on you know how dark this is nice
packaging though
sleek Mac matte black packaging here's
what the shade looks like looks so tad
orange but it might work and I have the
elf foundation brush right here this is
one of my favorite foundation brushes I
mentioned it tons before so my skin
isn't actually too horrible for me right
now this is mostly all scarring so we'll
see how well this covers up some of the
redness and stuff I don't even know what
kind of coverage this is supposed to be
as you can blend with a sponge or a
brush and reapply for buildable coverage
let's just blend this guy out a little
thicker
okay I'm actually really feeling the
shade of this I don't know if it's just
because I have that tan on right now but
I actually really like to show you this
coverage wise looks like a medium
coverage actually cover it a lot better
than I thought it was going to I did
apply quite a bit too so by the way here
update I am still going to be doing a
hair update video before I go in for the
next one but my hair basically there was
like an underneath section that got
super damaged and like gummy so I've
been trying to repair that before I go
back for the next process if you don't
want to talk about going from black to
silver hair right now and it's just a
major process taking it slow letting the
hair heal you do you hair if you want to
follow along with all the hair
shenanigans you can do so on Instagram
sure just clip up back down and put back
in here yeah pretty much update you guys
on Instagram and snapchat and Twitter
I'm active on everything but pretty much
everything at first update on snapchat
comment down below if you're a part of
the snap fam it feels not even creamy it
feels a little bit greasy when you first
apply it to your face but smooth it's
not hard to blend out or anything
splitting out pretty easily and I only
have my crusade of moisturizer on right
now which I use kind of as a primer so
I'm liking how it looks so far it looks
a little bit textured like MMF it's just
the brush not fully blending it out but
it looks a little bit like you can
totally ditch makeup on my face it says
it's buildable coverage so let's go in
for a second
thinner later it is in this eyeball okay
so just realize I don't have a couple
face products that I need from ELF so
I'm going to go in with my normal
concealer and setting powder it's gonna
be a 99.9 percent one brand tutorial as
far as how the foundations looking right
now it definitely looks like I have
makeup on but coverage wise I like it
and shade wise it does look like it
oxidizes a little bit but I still like
the tone of the foundation this is like
totally out this is my complexion
concealer one of my favorites and I
think I did try and help concealer like
a long time ago back in the day and I
wasn't a fan but maybe they've gotten
better who knows
I'm just going to use that same brush to
blend it out a little bit on my face
does anyone remember when all elf
products were a dollar and it was like
the greatest thing ever gonna set the
under eyes with my stargazer powder
because they don't have a white powder
from ELF but Redemption my favorite
powder brush to apply this you guys know
is this ELF powder brush I'm going to
have all the brushes and everything
linked down below they don't put names
on their brushes which is kind of
annoying I think that's like basic
creating a makeup line 101 name your
 I don't think I would be sending my
whole face today so I'm just going to
powder a tiny bit in the t-zone with the
same powder I feel like it actually
looks a lot better with the powder it
kind of like settled everything now on
to wonder brows let's do browsers I have
a brow product and over tried before
from ELF this is the instant lift brow
pencil in deep brown it says for dark
brown to black hair I got this obviously
when I still have black hair so it might
be a little bit dark but actually like
the look of dark brows with lighter hair
and this is from their dollar line so
alpha is like the dollar line and then
they have their studio line the studio
line is a little bit more expensive and
by expensive I mean like three dollars a
sort of a dollar brow update since my
bra lady I go to in San Diego fine lines
studios I love Kerry she's amazing did a
whole video on permanent brows but
anyways since she's in San Diego I
couldn't go back for the touch-up
appointment like you're supposed to do a
few weeks after so my touch of
appointment is coming up in a few weeks
so my brows are going to be done and I'm
excited I want to do like a little bit
more shape so I have to fill them in
less next time oh this shade is actually
perfecto
it's like a greyish dark grey shades
actually like the exact color of my
brows okay elf not too far away right
now
hey misty board here we go I can see my
face I have to go in and clean that up
with a little bit of concealer so glad a
little while but the shade of this is
like perfect literally matches my
eyebrow
perfectly gliding on super-easy I'm
actually very pleasantly surprised with
this if you like a waxy pencil you
probably won't like this it's not super
waxy but it glides on really easy and I
really like the shade of it so I will
definitely be using this again all right
now that the foundation has hopefully
set a little bit more still feels a
little bit sticky and there is
foundation coming off on my hand so
that's not good I'm just going to go
over where's my powder brush I'm just
going to take an empty powder brush
without anything on it and just go over
the areas I'm going to be applying my
bronzer and stuff just so it doesn't
drag so this is the elf bronzer in cool
and I've been using this for a couple
weeks and I love it and I had the self
tan on this was perfect I actually don't
think it's that cool it has a little bit
of like a terracotta red tone to it
which I really like so let's just do
some swirl action
look how easy that blended out okay now
on to blush this is one of my favorite
blushes of life this is the elf peachy
keen blush I've had this for years I
used to use this every single day like
when I first started my channel whoa
that feels like it was so long ago that
was so long ago this is such a beautiful
peachy I don't want to say shimmery but
it like gives you a nice glow next we're
going in with one of my favorite
products probably of all time this is
the elf illuminating palette I mentioned
this in a favorites video I've used this
a ton of hit pan on this shade which is
the shade I usually use like almost
every day it's a super pretty kind of
yellow toned white it just gives your
face such a pretty glow these are pretty
powdery so if you don't like that then
don't get this there's something about
it it just makes your face look so
beautiful if you peel skin you can
actually mix these two and use it kind
of as a bronzer I've done that too but
we're going to go in with the m5 ten
brush buy more face my favorite
highlighting brush and take some that
white look at that glow alright if you
haven't tried this yet you need to what
are we doing on the eyes I have no idea
first I'm going to go in from the
setting spray this is the makeup mist in
set has aloe green tea cucumber vitamins
A C and E clearly have not tried this
yet cuz I ran out of my two favorite
drugstore setting sprays of Maybelline
and L'Oreal one I've been using the hard
candy one just to like use it up and I
actually really like it it's growing on
me is about to get a shower what wears
is whoa okay
that was totally open whoa oh man this
is like fire hose spray
that's an interesting smell it's like
trying to be cucumber was not quite
there not a fan of that sprayer but it
is helping to make that foundation look
a lot better yeah foundation looks a lot
more won with this
and so I have like five billion
eyeshadow palettes here doing their
matte eyeshadow palettes I feel like
I've heard good things about these this
is party ready and then this one is mad
format I just open up both and use it
combo of the two whoo the matte format
one looks super nice whoa okay this one
looks a lot more intense than it does in
the thing this is party got some nice
blues and purples and Pink's in there
and this one bad format looks super
pretty look at that shade Alya I also
have this prism eyeshadow palette this
isn't a shame naked
I have swatched a couple of these and I
wasn't super impressed I'm just going to
prime the eyes with the tiny bit more of
that concealer been feeling super like
YouTube inspired lately have a whole
list of like 10 videos that I'm really
excited to film then doing more
Instagram videos first off I'm going to
take the party-ready palette and take
this shade right here this looks like a
perfect transition shade for the crease
eyelash glue on my lashes what's new
this is like the perfect transition
shade if you have like the light skin
tone still don't know what kind of look
we're going for probably figure that out
feel like I've gotten a lot of requests
for purple but I kind of want to wait to
do a purple look with that wet and wild
eyeshadow palette that I hold might use
this pink pink is kind of like speaking
to me okay I don't think I'm doing a
pink this is actually not that pretty it
looks like it's supposed to be a shimmer
but then when you swatch it it's kind of
like matte and a little bit chalky might
do something with it gold ooh that white
gold is super pretty I will just do like
a classic smokey I haven't done that in
I don't know if I've ever done that so
we are just going to put shadow on our
face and see what happens
story of my life okay so I'm going to
take this shade right here let's put
this into the crease a little bit and
the key with smokey eyes my opinion is
blending and layering so you don't want
to go straight into like a black shadow
or a dark dark brown
shadow we want to kind of layer it up
seriously this is it is like on fire
what's happening kind of want to layer
it up so that everything blends
seamlessly wonder what the most used
word from like Beauty people on YouTube
is probably blend hoarsely so friends
let's go back in with that mad format
palette I'm going to take this shade
right here I take a tiny bit of that and
this is a really perfect brush for this
is the M 514 pretty tiny blending brush
so you can just get into the crease
exactly where you want it I'm not going
to bring this shade in the outer V I'm
mostly just focusing this straight into
the crease the wedding makeup tutorial
that I mentioned like how do you know
when last year probably is actually
coming I ordered a bunch of stuff for it
probably going to miss wedding season
now that I think about it but we're
going to take this shader here the black
on a more densely packed blending brush
you're not bringing this up to the
crease I'm keeping this mostly on the
lid to start it now we're going to take
a separate brush and blend that into the
crease this isn't the blackest black of
all blacks but it'll do and it's okay if
you're getting kind of more inward than
you'd like we're going to apply a shadow
over top so I have a ton of trips coming
up splash I've been taking a ton of
trips this whole summer so far if you
haven't been following me on snapchat or
Instagram I went to Colorado for
Kendall's wedding hit larae on YouTube
which one of my good YouTube friends it
was so awesome getting to see her get
married then the weekend after that I
went to Tahoe for like a family vacation
now in a couple weeks I'm going to San
Diego for my grandma's 90th birthday
happy birthday grandma love that lady
then a couple weeks after that not a
couple weeks like a month after that I'm
going on a cruise to Mexico with some
college friends so that will be super
fun I might also be going to New York
soon I'm debating with black you want to
make sure that you don't over blend or
else the colors are just going to look
super murky murky yeah
murky so I'm just a little super lightly
blending the top of that into the crease
a little bit like a tiny
you try any of it barely putting any
pressure right now and just focus on
blending this top area right here versus
this because we're going to be put in
color and probably packing on some more
block to vote in with this gold shade
right here and I'm just putting this
kind of on the middle of my eye make
sure you don't bring it up too high or
too far into the black focusing it right
on the inner part inner middle part then
I'm going to dip my brush into this
light white gold shade right here
because it looks super pretty and then
we're going to wet it I'm just going to
spray some of that elf setting spray on
top of this so now I'm going to put this
on the inner ring that down to the inner
corner I'm going to go back in with a
tiny bit more black and again not
putting this in the crease at all just
kind of blending into that gold shade I
want to try this prism palette I feel
like we need a little
something-something on that middle right
there I think I'm going to take this
shade right here and put tiny bit of
that on the center now for the lower
lash line I'm taking some black eyeliner
I didn't have any elf black eyeliner so
this is the LA girl and anything that I
substituted for elf I tried to make
super affordable so this is like a
dollar a couple dollars I'll link it
down below but this is one of my
favorite black eyeliners for the
waterline is the LA girl glide gel liner
okay there's like an 87% chance this
might hook my eye will first going to go
with black eyeshadow to blend that out
this is the same matte black and the
whole key with putting black eyeliner on
your waterline is that you definitely
want to blend some black eyeshadow or
dark brown underneath it bring this
pretty far in but stopping right where
it meets that inner corner shade okay
now I'm going to wipe off that black on
my brush a little bit and go in with
this shade that we used before this
Brown right here and just blend that
right underneath shadow is done I have
this intense ink I line
I'm kind of scared to use this I'm
afraid it's gonna like up the whole
look but this is in blackest black whoa
it's literally like marker status scared
so creating that base was super quick
and easy it looks like a nice matte
black I'm debating what I want to do a
wing or not I'm going to be putting some
intense false lashes on so I kind of
feel like we don't need a wing and I am
bringing that all the way into my inner
corner okay definitely not bad I think
I'm gonna skip the wing but I'll try a
wing with this and update you guys on
snapchat how it goes so we're gonna go
in with just a coat of mascara and then
apply false lashes this is my last ELF
cheat but this is the aisle or 121
lashes elf
I am NOT a fan of lashes at all one I
don't have any if I had some I would put
it on for the video but I don't have any
and I'm not a fan of them at all these
are drugstore as well so you can find
them at Ulta 1:21 these are amazing I
love these especially for like a smokey
eye I love these because as you can see
the lashes are more concentrated on the
outer half so it basically just makes
you look like you have a really nice cat
eye so I'm gonna apply lashes mascara
all that good stuff and I'll be right
back don't forget to hydrate kids ok
lashes are on I freaking love these
false lashes final step we're going in
for lipstick I've never tried the elf
moisturizing lipstick I love their matte
lip crayon things whatever they're
called this is in the shade in the nude
and I feel like I've heard good things
about this this is some intense
packaging for lipstick I've gotta say
alright let's do this I'm not going to
use a liner
oh it smells like vanilla kind of smells
like the MAC lipsticks actually
does feel super moisturizing I do have
super dry cracked lips right now and
they look really nice and moisturized I
like the color it's a tiny bit more like
orange II than I was envisioning for
this look so I think you might put an
eyeshadow over top I'm going to attempt
to put this light pink shadow right here
over top this has been like my new
favorite thing like putting eyeshadow
over lipstick it helps to make it look
matte and also I can just change the
color a lot okay I like that like 50
times better alright so this is the
final look if you guys liked this video
