today's I look it's going to be using
the new it's Judy's time palette by BH
Cosmetics it retails for 1495 on their
website which is a super good deal I
love it so far
so I just show you its size here in
relation to the naked palette as you can
see it's much smaller good for traveling
I'm starting out by priming my eyes with
Mac's painterly paint-pot
I'm using this as a base next I'm taking
this matte light brown shade that's
terrible - Mac's soft Brown I would say
and I'm just blending this in circular
motions into the crease and this is just
gonna serve as a transition color and
all that goodness you need one of these
whenever you're doing an eyelid
next I'm taking this shimmery like bold
shade and applying this all over the lid
with a flat shader brush this is a lot
more orange toned than I expected it's
not like a true gold it definitely has
some orange rosy undertones to it but I
do like it has a pretty shimmer and it
was pigmented so that felt is a plus I'm
just blending that up to that first
flowery foot down and then taking this
darker brown matte shade and blending
this with a kind of firmer fluffy
blending brush if that make sense
into the crease and this is gonna help
smooth out those two colors and blend
them together
next I'm taking this Steve kind of
mahogany matte brown color which I
absolutely love and I'm using just a
receipt to kind of create this line
right there and this is gonna give a lot
of definition to the eye kind of the
front cut crease look but a little bit
more blended and I'm just doing this on
the outer 1/3 and it's the shape now I'm
taking a blending brush without any
product on it and just smoothing that
out we want everything to just look
effortless and blended going back in
with the gold shade I'm just going to
Pat this over my lid with my finger just
to give it a little more pop and pigment
and then using the first creamy white
shade in the palette this is also matte
I'm going to just pop this under the
brow and then also in the inner corner
of my eye and underneath a little bit
going back in with that dark mahogany
color I'm just going to line my lower
lash line about the outer thirds with
that color
now to line the eyes I'm doing kind of a
simple easy wings look and I'm using the
Maybelline gel liner in brown I'm just
drawing this on you could use a black if
you wanted I just thought the brown
would go well with the rest of the tones
we got going on
and on the waterline I'm using a light
cream eye pencil by Rimmel this is just
gonna help brighten up the eye
everything for the eyes now for the lips
I'm taking NYX deep breath liner and
lightening lips I'm also going to fill
them in you could leave it like this and
do a red matte lip for throwing some
Matt's Ruby woo or something along those
lines but I thought I would go with kind
of a shiny look and I'm using afterwards
the L'Oreal act pencil in black phonic
and I love this especially for like the
winter and holiday all the days I just
think it's absolutely gorgeous so that
is everything
